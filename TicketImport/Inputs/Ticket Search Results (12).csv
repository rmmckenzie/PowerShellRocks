I have been in touch with Jo Bogue, and she has verified that neither Sandra nor Amanda is intended to possess email accounts. 

This is attributed to their employment not being with Vale, but with Hutchison. It is worth noting that Amanda previously held an email account during her tenure as a cleaning operative at Vale. The provision of an email address for yourself is to facilitate the school's communication with you.

You will need to engage with Hutchison to explore the possibility of creating email accounts for your team.

Not sure who I should email regarding this...

I appear to have 'two accounts' on the Reception sign-in station. I was
told that this did not matter in terms of me signing in.

However, I have discovered from the YoYo team that depending on which ""Me""
they select, either I do or I do not get an automated email to say that
they have arrived. Obviously it is handy to know when visitors are here.

Could this be rectified? Thanks, Richard

Hello

Deitan's mum is at student reception to pick up his phone. We don't know where the phone is and no one has logged it on Class charts

If you have it please could you take it to student reception as a matter of urgency?

Hello all,



Just a quick query… is there any chance the projector could be moved to the main whiteboard in B02? I appreciate this is not a simple task and there may be a reason in maths why the projector beams into the corner – if so then no probs (thats why I have copied you maths gents in).



My Y7 form really struggle to read powerpoints (M3, behaviour curriculum etc) or see embedded videos and so on, from its current vantage point.



Thought it was worth an ask.



Cheers

It looks like your SIMS connection with Wonde isn’t working as expected.
Book an appointment with the Wonde Support team to resolve this.

[image: Action required]

*SIMS server needs restarting*

Hi Sam

It looks like your *SIMS* connection with Wonde isn’t working as expected.
This will affect the syncing and updating of any information between *Aspire
Academy* and your applications (*8*) through Wonde.

*Please be assured, even though the connection is failing, your data is
protected and secure.*


*Next steps*

Access the machine and open SIMS.net

If you get a SIMS error message when attempting to log in then the recent
client update has not been successful and you will need to reboot the
server.

If you are able to open SIMS.net please re-apply the latest SIMS client
update to the server and reboot again.

*Once the above steps are complete*, please email
<support@wonde.com>*support@wonde.com
<support@wonde.com>* to let us know, including your school name, postcode
and an identifier such as the DfE number or URN.


If you have any issues with the above or would prefer to speak directly
with our support team please *Click here
<https://school.wonde.com/book-appointment/failing/aspire-academy>* to book
an appointment.

If you are not the right person to resolve this, please forward to the
appropriate person.

If you have any questions, please contact us. We look forward to getting
this resolved as soon as possible.

Subject: Projector in B02


Hello all,



Just a quick query… is there any chance the projector could be moved to the main whiteboard in B02? I appreciate this is not a simple task and there may be a reason in maths why the projector beams into the corner – if so then no probs (thats why I have copied you maths gents in).



My Y7 form really struggle to read powerpoints (M3, behaviour curriculum etc) or see embedded videos and so on, from its current vantage point.



Thought it was worth an ask.



Cheers

please can we be extra vigilant with checking before and after our students

and ensure all computers have a mouse and keyboard are correct with keys
being taken out. This has worked well with my year 10 and 11's and they let
me know at the start of the lesson if there is something wrong with their
PC because they know when I check at the end they will be made accountable
if they didn't report the damage or missing item at the beginning. Hope
this makes sense. This is really important, particularly for GCSE classes
where we need to use every machine in the lesson because of class numbers.

Hi Oliver,



So you have the mobility print app on the Chrome books but the required
follow me queue is not on there. If that is the case, can you chase your IT
and have them contact me so that I can check that the Follow Me queue is
correctly set up and published in Mobility print

It looks like it's already setup, it just wanted us to download some
additional software, I assume this would need to be on all chromebooks for
it to work. If you could contact Vital York. help@vitalyork.com so they can
help set it up on our chromebooks as we have no rights to install the

Good afternoon Oliver,



Printing from Chromebooks requires the use of Mobility print. Once
installed and configured on your server the Mobility Print Chrome app can
be installed on the Chromebooks to allow them to print.

I am happy to carry out a remote session onto your Papercut server to see
if this is currently installed and if not we can go ahead and install it
for you and publish the queues you wish Chrome book users to use.

I have included a link to the Papercut help section that explains how
Papercut Mobility Print works.

Hopefully this is what you were looking for.

Book an appointment with the Wonde Support team to resolve this.

*SIMS server needs restarting*

Hi Nikola

It looks like your *SIMS* connection with Wonde isn’t working as expected.
This will affect the syncing and updating of any information between *Aspire
Academy* and your applications (*8*) through Wonde.

*Please be assured, even though the connection is failing, your data is
protected and secure.*


*Next steps*

Access the machine and open SIMS.net

If you get a SIMS error message when attempting to log in then the recent
client update has not been successful and you will need to reboot the
server.

If you are able to open SIMS.net please re-apply the latest SIMS client
update to the server and reboot again.

*Once the above steps are complete*, please email
<support@wonde.com>*support@wonde.com
<support@wonde.com>* to let us know, including your school name, postcode
and an identifier such as the DfE number or URN.


If you have any issues with the above or would prefer to speak directly

Hi,
Since last Wednesday, I have been unable to print anything from my laptop.
I understand that something was updated and this has caused the problem.

I'm not sure if this error message has anything to do with it.

Please advise what I should do.

,T20240129.0037,New Mic System in S19 Issue,"Hi there,

I want to flag an issue with the new system for Lauren's mic running
through the speakers that are attached to the projector in S19.

When the board is frozen, those speakers do not emit any sound.

There will be times when Lauren will need to freeze the board, and this is
a regular part of day-to-day teaching.  However, Lauren's mic will then not
work and therefore she cannot communicate with students clearly and
classroom management will become an issue.

Is there a way to solve this issue quickly as Lauren will be teaching in
S19 during Period 2?

If there is no solution to this then I need to ask for the speakers to be
reattached to how they previously were, as this was a system we have been
using since 2022 and had been working well.

Thanks,

Adam

,T20240126.0224,BNT+ and embosser training,"Hi Jonny,
We'd love it if you could join us for the braille note touch plus and embosser training next Thursday (1st February) at Yearsley Grove.  It will start at 9.30am and the first session will be on the BNT+.  After that, at approximately 11-11.30 we will move on to embosser training.
At the moment the BNT+ is working well, however it isn't sending emails. It seems to be connected to the internet ok but there isn't any connectivity.  This is a priority for me to sort and make sure it can work in his classroom as his teacher needs to be able to email him work. We can discuss this with Allison from Humanware on Thursday during the training session.
Student, parents and staff will all be at the training for the BNT+ then it will be you, the 1:1 TA and me at the embosser training.
All the best,
Abi

,T20240126.0221,new website,"Hi

any help greatly appreciated, we are launching a new website and i have
been asked the following:

'With the launch date of your new website fast approaching, I just wanted
to reach out with a query regarding your domain name (website address).

So that your new website suites with the more recognisable format of the
other schools within SBMAT, your new site will need to sit on our new
domain of *www.scarcroftprimaryschool.co.uk
<http://www.scarcroftprimaryschool.co.uk/>* rather than the current
out-of-date City of York Council domain (*www.scarcroft.york.sch.uk
<http://www.scarcroft.york.sch.uk/>*). If anyone clicks an old link or
types the old website address into a browser, we always set up diverts to
make sure traffic is automatically redirected to your new website address –
but – we'll need to make some technical changes to the admin panel
associated with *www.scarcroft.york.sch.uk
<http://www.scarcroft.york.sch.uk/>.*

Because this domain is registered directly with the global web organisation
Nominet we're unable to do this and *I wondered if you had a login to a
Nominet admin account* for www.scarcroft.york.sch.uk?

*If you do,* the task of transferring/redirecting is quite simple and we
can help you with making the appropriate tweaks in your admin panel.

*If not,* it gets a little more tricky as we'll need you to prove the
ownership of www.scarcroft.york.sch.uk *before* we can make the redirect
tweaks in the admin panel.
To do this, you'll have to contact Nominet and explain the situation, then
they will have to go through the process of re-establishing your
identity/authorisation (unfortunately we cannot do this – it has to be done
by the account holder – ie you) via:
https://theukdomain.uk/help-centre/what-do-i-do-if-ive-lost-access-to-my-email-account/

If all this sounds unfamiliar, it might also be worth checking if the
school has a direct contact with another global web organisation called
*Bytemark* (who manage the DNS for your current website) who may be able to
help,'

I have no idea about any of it so i am hoping you might? any help as i said
greatly appreciated

Many Thanks

It looks like there is a loop on the network in the school, please could you let whoever manages the Netgear switches on site that they need to find a remove this loop as it is causing the network to be unstable. There is another job open to look at the phones on site with issues.

Morning Caroline,



Hope you are well.



I have picked up your ticket: Copmanthorpe Primary School  Is it possible to default all printers to print in black/white, please?



Yes, this can be done, but I will require access to the print server to default the drivers to B/W, would you be able to supply me the contact details for your IT so I can request TeamViewer access and get this implemented for you.



Kind Regards,

john

Subject: Phone Issue

Morning Adam,

I hope you are well. A parent has reported that the voicemail is currently not working, including that to leave a message for absence. Please could this be looked into?

Additionally, please could I make some changes / receive some advice for the below:

  *   Please could the live still ring until 5pm. At the moment it cuts out at 4 but we still have staff and children in the building until 5pm.
  *   Is there a way I can divert to the main phone to ring from another phone if I am away from the office?
  *   When the school is closed, after 5pm, please could the option to leave a message be available?
Many thanks for your help!

We are still having ongoing issues in printing! I know Kat flagged up with
you on Tuesday. I think the issue is linked to a new pop up about Printix?
We’ve never had this pop up before one user has managed to login into this

user? Please see attached screen shots. We really need this issue fusing
asap!

Hi, I think it was Johnny who came in on Monday to look at the ticket but said it would be £75 as it was additional work. I just wanted to confirm this is ok and to go ahead with that?

I only work Weds-Fri, if possible could it be one of these days so I can have a chat with whoever it is that comes in?

Thanks

Hello,

I am having some issues with a couple of things ICT related,

We have an interactive screen in class (one of the ones with a blue frame
around it) It will come on but I cant get it to log in. I also think the
touch on the touch screen may need looking at.

Also I am unable to get my emails on my phone. I think its something to do
with the authenticator app and a new phone.

Lucy, please can you pass this on to vital or do you have an email address
that I can send it via.

Thanks

Hi Jen,

From the image, I can see that the slides are not being blocked by our
filtering but is instead related to an issue with account permissions for
your Google account. Regardless, I have ensured that Google Slides and
Google Accounts are unblocked for all filtering groups, but the slides
won't work until your Google account is configured with the correct
permission/access rights. You should be able to get more info on this from
Google accounts FAQs

Kind regards,

I would appreciate it if we could sort another solution for these

laboriously copy and paste them into the relevant student’s log - after
identifying who the student is. This is just not efficient. Can this be
reverted to how it was working before?

,T20240124.0163,Photocopiers at POPS,"Good afternoon,

Please can I ask that someone goes to Poppleton to check the settings on
their photocopiers are all correct?

They are having problems with the machines jamming all the time and have
been buying very expensive paper to combat it. We don't want to continue
paying this price for the paper so the problem needs to be resolved.

I've also asked Kyocera to resolve the problem but in the meantime I would
appreciate it if someone could just check if it's not something in the
settings that might be causing the issue.

The photocopiers still had the below capacity when we extended the contract
in August this year so I can't understand how they can be having such a
problem when they've hardly been used.

Since having the new printer/photocopier installed on Monday we are having
a number of issues.

Some of our users are unable to register their cards on the system.  The
following people have raised this so far.

Rachel Uttley
Shelley Drury
Gavin Hussey

A number of people are unable to connect to the Colour Printer, including
Emily Corner, Naomi Thompson and Megan Budden.

One person, Susan Drury, has not been able to connect to the B&W Printer
either.

Nicola Thompson said she tried to send things to print last night from home
and they have not appeared on the Print Release list.

Please can you let me know what we need to do to resolve these issues.

Many thanks

 We received multiple crowdstrike alerts triggered by the volume shadow copy deletion process vssadmin.exe on the host GRA-DATA01 being performed by the administrator, who was logging in locally into the host. The process was blocked by crowdstrike.
 
 
 Parent Process 
 Host name: GRA-DATA01 File name: powershell.exe File path: \Device\HarddiskVolume4\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe Command line: ""C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe"" Platform: Windows IP address: 185.60.121.224 User name: GRA-DATA01\Administrator

 VSS tampering, which is a ransomware technique that this activity mimics, is a technique used by threat actors to prevent recovery of system after compromising the system. 
 
 As this device is listed in a high priority group in crowdstrike, we would like to confirm that this is a legitimate system administration activity on going on this host at this time. 
 
 Thank you.

this a misunderstanding?

,T20240123.0248,Speakers S19,"Hi,

Last year, I reported the main speakers in S19 did not work.

I was told they couldn’t be replaced at that time, and instead 2 speakers
were placed by the PC/window ledge.

Is it still the case that the main speakers cannot be fixed?

There is often limited sound out of the replacement and they are obviously
only on one side of the room.

Thanks
Lauren

,T20240123.0246,Adobe Express and School Instagram accounts,"Hi there,

This is Nick Rawcliffe from Yearsley Grove Primary School, I am Computing
lead there. Recently, I signed up to Adobe Express to get full educational
access. I have tried looking to see if I can add staff to it but it doesn't
appear to be clear. Can you advise how to add staff to it so they can also
get full access? Do you know when pupils will be able to use it as
currently this feature is available in the USA?

On a separate topic, we currently use X as a social media platform for the
school for each year group but we feel that we may get more interaction and
following using Instagram. Do any schools that you support currently use
instagram? If so, how do they ensure security on there?

Kind regards

,T20240123.0239,FAO All Staff re. Assessment Arrangements,"Afternoon all,

When staff are in the main hall or dance studio during assessments please
can we keep mobile phones on silent/'do not disturb' as some students have
said that staff mobiles pinging and buzzing are distracting them.

Also, please do not suggest to students that they may be able to do their
exam in a different room to the main one. It is extremely difficult to get
additional access arrangements for students, and even moving students to a
different seat within the exam room requires evidence, so for this and any
other arrangements please go through myself or Angela King only.

Many thanks for your support with this,

Tom

Hi Mark,

Thanks for confirming, ISDN services are annoying because the line test
will aways show as fine because the test will just try make a call across 1
of the 8 lines so as long as it manages to get through one of 8 it will
show as fine.

Unfortunately since ISDN are coming to end of life Openreach have backws
off support for it so in instances like this where a clear fault isn't
showing they do not provide us much to work with.

We are still in contact with Openreach trying to get an engineer sent, will
be looking to try and get confirmation this by then end of today.

Once again sever apologies for the delay around this.

Kind regards,

Hi Ellis

They are showing green lights, But 1/2 and 3/4 are not giving dial tones at
all.

We have tried to troubleshoot at the school by using them in different
ports  on the phone system (that we know are working). We also have tried
different cables, with still no dial tone on those lines. If there is
anything else you can suggest that we can try I am happy to try this, but
the issue seems like its further down the line.

The only other thing that can be tested onsite is the connection from the
ISDN boxes to the incoming cable but as that is BT equipment would that not
be openreach who do this

Apologies if this is not a question for Vital but I don't know who else to

Integris to CPOMS.  I've uploaded new starters in both MIS just be sure but
it has been over a week now and the data has not synced. I know Giles has
been working on Wonde but I don't know if CPOMS pulls information from
Wonde, or if this is a separate issue. I've been able to change ParentPay
from Integris to SIMS but I don't have access right to CPOMS to do this.

Could anyone give some advice please?

The cable connecting my laptop to the projector has been faulty for a
while, where I need to adjust the angle all the time or else the projected
screen is a yellowish colour. Today, the projected screen is very pink and
won't clearly display my slides. Please could I ask for some help with
this? I suspect a replacement cable might be required as the same issue
occurred when a chromebook was connected to the screen, so I don't think it
is the laptop.

Jemma Dunne (Headteacher at St Oswald's CE Primary School) has a scheduled monitoring meeting with yourselves at 10:30am today to discuss monitoring systems.

Unfortunately, she is unable to attend the meeting. I was wondering if I would be able to attend as Deputy Head in her place and could have the zoom link sent through to this email please?

Apologies that this is short notice but was hoping you could assist.

Thank you

On Thursday we have some visitors to Graham School called Amazelab. They
will be running two sessions in S8 (Periods 2 & 3). They need to use
zoom so that a cancer specialist can talk to the pupils. Just checking that
we can link to zoom, if not can you arrange for the computer in S8 to be
able to do so.

When Mateusz came to look at Vicky's board, he said the port in the wall
was damaged but in the interim, a cable could be run from the PC to the
board instead.
Please can you let me know when Mateusz plans to return to fix the issue?

Please can you let me know if this is an error on your end Vital, or is it
more likely a PSF issue or perhaps even a NYCC internet issue. Any help or

school. Downloading works fine while I am in school but as soon as I am on
another network I cannot download anything. I just keep getting the message

Googling the issues it seems like I may need to update my browser (chrome)
but I can't do that myself.  It has prevented me getting work done all

I've had a bit of a change in my office in the common room and was hoping my computer could be moved to the desk on the other side of the room.  It would mean needing a longer cable to get to the other side but otherwise I htink it would be fine.  Could this be done please?

Thank you

I just wanted to flag the following:

Year 11 are currently completing a piece of opinion writing on Raheem
Sterling and his tattoo in English. I've just tried to research some extra
information on this in the lesson as students asked and everything is
blocked. Even just a google of Raheem Sterling's name is blocked... This is
on my desktop, not on student chromebooks. I understand the need for strict
monitoring of websites in school but this has meant that students have had
limited access to relevant information.

The wifi in B07 has been bad for a while. There are various dead zones in the room. I am concerned as my top set year 9 maths group are supposed to be doing an online maths challenge next week.

Is there any way this could be improved or do I need to look at a room swap?

The wifi makes any kind of computer-based lesson difficult at the moment.

Many thanks,

Jayne

We have tried to reset passwords and have not been able to at home. Please can you help Oliver as he is worried and stressing about his homework. Or is there another person he needs to try and find as he needs his emails for his tutor sessions on a weekend.

The following web link is for a personality profile quiz for discovering
what your personality type is and how it can impact on learning styles etc.
It'd be great to use with some children and staff might what to do it too
as it reveals preferred working styles and compatible colleagues. It's
copyright free and safe so please can we ask Vital to unblock it.

It will be managed by the SEND Team so something like SENWIDGET would be fine.

**************
I hope this email finds you well. Following on from previous communication, I would like to emphasise the importance of the prompt gathering of the necessary information for Widgit Online access.



As of now, we have received only a limited number of emails, and while I understand the demands on everyone's time, it is crucial that we ensure all team members have access to and start utilising Widgit Online at the earliest.



I kindly request that each setting sends me an email address no later than Friday, January 19th. This will enable us to facilitate a smooth transition and ensure everyone is on board as soon as possible.



Your cooperation in this matter is greatly appreciated, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.



Thank you for your prompt attention to this request.

Hi all,



Following on from the City Wide Training delivered on 8th January we advised that the LA had purchased Widgit online for each school to use and further details would follow.

This purchase has now been completed and ready for each setting to access. To enable this, we need one dedicated email that all staff from each setting can use as it is one user per setting.



Please can you ask your school admin to set up a specific email for all to use for this purpose and send @Narborough Jo the email which will be used to access the link and log in details etc.



Thank you.



Best wishes,

Hi Mark,

This is Alan with Autodesk Education Support. I wanted to send you a quick
summary from our chat today.

The issue you were experiencing was accessing AutoCAD Electrical as a
network license with your educational access. To troubleshoot this, I
provided you with this support article to get a network license and deploy
your products: Education software | Set up a lab (autodesk.com)
<https://www.autodesk.com/support/account/education/admin/lab-setup>

   - Note: After registering your product, it can take 48–72 hours for the
   product to show up in your account. However, once available, you will be
   able to follow the steps on this page to generate a license file: Generate
   Autodesk License File | Administrator Installation
   <https://www.autodesk.com/support/download-install/admins/network-licenses/obtain-and-install-a-license-file>


Mark, it was my pleasure assisting you with your needs today and thank you
for using Autodesk. I will mark this case as Solved for now and an
automated survey will be sent.

Should you have any follow-up questions/concerns, please create a new chat
with us here <https://ava.autodesk.com/modular/?module=edu>.

Best,
Alan

[image: National Cyber Security Centre banner]


Dear User,

We hope this message finds you well.

We want to bring to your attention the new compliance requirements set by
Google
<https://support.google.com/a/answer/81126?sjid=11812381125322301321-EU&visit_id=638411774298363381-2583796662&rd=1#requirements-5k&zippy=%2Crequirements-for-sending-or-more-messages-per-day>
and Yahoo
<https://senders.yahooinc.com/best-practices/?guccounter=1#authenticate>
that will take effect starting February 1, 2024.

These changes could cause disruption to your email delivery and the
potential marking of your emails as spam if you are not compliant with the
standards. Most of these are existing standards which we already recommend
but Google and Yahoo are raising the bar; applying stricter filters to
improve their spam and spoofed email prevention.
Who is impacted?

These guidelines will affect all domains sending emails to Gmail or Yahoo
accounts who are currently non-compliant with the required standards. In
particular, high-volume senders (at the moment it is 5,000 emails per day)
to Google or Yahoo accounts will be subjected to stricter rules.
Quick Compliance Checklist

   - Email Authentication: Confirm SPF and DKIM are set for your domain.


   - DMARC Policy: We advise you to implement a DMARC policy. Ensure DMARC
   alignment, especially if you’re a high-volume sender.


   - TLS Security: You must use a TLS connection for transmitting email.


   - Best Practices: Adhere to RFC standards, maintain valid PTR records
   (reverse DNS) for sending domains or IPs, provide clear one-click
   unsubscribe option.

Take Swift Actions with Mail Check

   - Anti-Spoofing: Review your SPF, DKIM and DMARC configuration
   (including domain alignment) and see if your emails are trusted using DMARC
   Reporting and DMARC Insights using Mail Check
   <https://my.ncsc.gov.uk/mailcheck>.


   - Email Privacy: Review TLS configurations for your domain. Mail Check
   assesses inbound TLS to the mail servers listed in your MX record. Ask your
   email provider about outbound TLS or use other suitable online tools.


   - Reverse DNS: Look for ‘Suspicious emails failing reverse DNS checks’
   under ‘DMARC reporting’ in Mail Check <https://my.ncsc.gov.uk/mailcheck>.
   You can also find this information (where applicable) under ‘DMARC
   Insights’.Additionally, you can perform PTR lookups using the DNS tool of
   your choice.

For step-by-step configuration guides and to understand how to analyse your
email traffic, refer to our online resources Email security and
anti-spoofing
<https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/email-security-and-anti-spoofing> and How
to analyse your email traffic
<https://my.ncsc.gov.uk/mailcheck/aggregate-report-help>.

If you are unsure about other elements of Google and Yahoo guidelines not
covered by Mail Check, we advise you to consult your email provider(s) or
refer to related online guidance.
Stay Ahead

With Google and Yahoo enforcing new rules, and others likely to follow,
it’s crucial to adhere to universal best practices in email security.

Don’t wait—act now to avoid disruptions or your emails to be marked as spam.
Need help?

Our team is ready to assist. You can use the ‘Contact us’ link in the
‘Help’ section on MyNCSC <https://my.ncsc.gov.uk/> to get in touch.

Kind regards,

The Mail Check Team

,T20240118.0209,Wifi codes for Pathfinder TSH,"Hello

We have a supply of both 7-day and 1-day wifi codes for the Teaching School
Hub.  On a couple of occasions recently the 7-day codes have stopped
working mid week and we wondered if they had a limited number of users
assigned to them as we couldn't think of another reason (one day it was 30
people in a room and the first 10 got signed in and then it stopped working
for the remainder so we had to give them a different code) and we haven't
had this problem before.

The number of visitors requiring the codes can vary each week from 20 to
200 depending on what events we have running.  Are you able to shed some
light on this or has it just been a blip?

Many thanks,

Judith Cole

Following our cyber security audit we have one action to resolve that
auditors have asked for:

*""The trust will look to regularly receive positive confirmation of network
and system security in-line with the current industry best practice, and
report to management that network and system security is both sufficient
and regularly maintained.""*

As we dont have any visibility on the network security and Azure systems,
to cover this we can get a statement from yourselves confirming the above.

Kind Regards,

My laptop lost connection to the internet/network at the end of the school
day today. I restarted it and turned it off and back on a few times but
couldn’t connect it to the Pathfinder WiFi. I turned the WiFi on and off
also, and this still didn’t work.

I am now at home and have tried to log on but can’t get into my account
now. The error msg I get is the attached. This happened last week too.


Please could you help.

I've spoken to Andrew Hill and there is no such option for teachers to
reset student passwords. It would save us all so much time if this could be
arranged. Please can you look into it? In the meantime, please can you
reset the passwords for:

Nevaeh Codling
Charles Brabbs
Ruby Paylor

These students could not sit their exam this morning as they couldn't log
in.

Something strange is happening as I helped Charles last week and he wrote
the new password down accurately, but neither that or the reset password
worked.

Thanks

P22 and P23 still no luck. This is the case across the Music team btw.
My data for yr7 is done but it would be good to have more than one machine working for SIMS in the department if that's possible.

,T20240117.0213,Re: DT6 password suggestion,"Again, another lesson that has taken 20 minutes to reset passwords for 5
out of the 9 students attending. Class 7Dt6

The TA had some passwords handwritten down- but they did not work.

We need a simple system that the TA can use as they need to. Hand writing
passwords at this level with these students simply is setting them up to
fail. I have access to password reset tools for PC and Google most staff do
not.

Can we urgently sort this ongoing problem that I have reported throughout
the year. These students are about to have assessments in every subject and
cannot afford to be having half of the time logging on. This group in
particular has a wide range of needs with one TA who supports India- there
are many other students who simply need more support and cannot afford to
fall at the first hurdle due to password admin issues.

Much appreciated

Good afternoon Oliver,

Printing from Chromebooks requires the use of Mobility print. Once installed and configured on your server the Mobility Print Chrome app can be installed on the Chromebooks to allow them to print.
I am happy to carry out a remote session onto your Papercut server to see if this is currently installed and if not we can go ahead and install it for you and publish the queues you wish Chrome book users to use.
I have included a link to the Papercut help section that explains how Papercut Mobility Print works.

https://www.papercut.com/help/manuals/mobility-print/setting-up-a-device-mdns-dns/client-setup-chrome/<https://www.papercut.com/help/manuals/mobility-print/setting-up-a-device-mdns-dns/client-setup-chrome/>

Hopefully this is what you were looking for.

The computer in Reception classroom isn't working, it is unusable for

issues with the day-day software Helen uses since the new whiteboard was

all so it's quite urgent

,T20240117.0142,No wifi,"Hi there,

Last week the wifi went down in Owls class (Y5/6 FOG) and the same has
happened again just now. Could this be resolved and is there a way of
avoiding it happening again please? If there’s something I can do please
let me know as this will regularly interfere with my ability to teach and
for the pupils to use chromebooks.

Thanks!

Hi Rob
I have my new laptop and it is working well except for SMART notebook
(which I think was initially working) but then seemed to disappear just
before the Christmas holidays.

I have tried to download it online, but I can't get anywhere without an
admin username and password. Kate forwarded me the email you sent her with
the product key, but I can't even get it to open so I have no way of
entering that :(

Not sure I should need to download it, as it is already on our school
system?
Let me know if you have any ideas
Thank you,
Rose

Hi all

Attached is the trainee allocation for placement 2.

Jacqui - the current trainees will finish on 9th February. Could you put
their end date as the Monday 12th Feb on sims so they still have access on
the Friday and can finish anything they need to off.  Placement 2 trainees
will need to have access from the *20th Feb*, please are you able to add
the details we have so far on sims please.

HOD can you confirm mentors for the second placement, I currently have the
following mentors, please let me know if this has changed.
*Science will now need an additional mentor as have two trainees. If this
is a person new to mentoring please let me know as soon as possible so we
can see when they can go on a mentoring course/ support.*

,T20240117.0019,Slow Chromebook/Login,"Hi,

One of our Chromebooks/users seems particularly slow compared to the rest
of the class. It can take a lot longer to load documents/pages or not load
them at all.
We've tried the classic turn off and on, leaving the Chromebook shut down
overnight but it doesn't seem to have helped.

I tried the child on another Chromebook and we seemed to have the same
issue with slowness so I'm not sure if it is an issue with the user profile
rather than the actual Chromebook.

His school username is:
17georgep

Is this anything you can help with?

Thanks,
Laura

I keep having my laptop glitch out, freeze everything and it won’t fix
itself unless I hold down the power button and reboot.

The laptop doesn’t seem to be overheating, so I’m worried there’s a virus
or something on the laptop

I’ve finally managed to get a picture of what the screen looks like when
the glitch happens as it usually only lasts about a second and then I just
can’t move my mouse or anything but this time it stayed longer - see image
below.

I will email vital now to ask, if not did you ever email it to anyone in school? If so I could ask them to forward it to me...

[You don't often get email from lucyreed92@gmail.com. Learn why this is important at https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification ]

Hi Miss, hope you are well

I’m currently doing my UCAS application for this year and I was wondering if you would be able to be my reference for it? Also I have been locked out of my school email so can’t access my old personal statement. Do you know who I would be able to contact from school to get it unlocked?

Many thanks,
Lucy

I’m just letting you know that I accidentally sent this email to Jasmine
Lee in Yr13. I don’t even know how it happened, as I don’t teach her.
Eileen was the one who spotted it.


IT - anyway to recall this or delete from the student’s email account?

Thanks and apologies,

Hi All,

Please see email below from Penny - this will be a useful message to pass
on at Parents' Evening I suspect, as it shows what we're doing to support
these students further.

I'll have a look at the mock data and see if there are any common issues
and form a plan.

Anything you think it's worth me knowing - pls let me know asap. I will
meet with the students on Friday and outline:
1) Why they're having additional support
2) What they can expect
3) What we'll be focussing on from now until HT

Thanks,

Sam

Hi Sam,

These are the list of names that I think would be good for PM registration
intervention.  I have started with all those of a target of 7+, who are
currently achieving grades 1-3.

Ideally, they would have two form times a week doing RE (maybe Monday and
Friday?) I have agreed with EST that you will no longer support Dan
Tillbrook and I have asked Alexis to try and find an alternative to you
having a form on a Friday.

Katie - is there a way we can tell which rooms are free during PM
registration?

Thanks,
Penny

Would it be possible to turn on the network socket 1/154 in the science
workroom please so I can plug in to work whilst the wifi is still not
great? I normally plug in to 1/153 next to it as that one works but someone
else is using that today and we could therefore do with another to use.

One of our teachers uses her PC on the WIFI and the WIFI isn't effective enough and is affecting her ability to access anything online. Due to the set up of her classroom her desk isn't near the BT box allow her to plug directly into the telephone line to use the internet that way.

I am wondering if you have a long cable that we could use to allow her to plug her PC in to the BT box or if we would need to order an extra long cable.

,T20240116.0114,Smoothwall,"Hi Craig,

Kat Stephenson and I are concerned that Smoothwall is not working as it
should so we are not getting all the alerts whenever students are typing
inappropriate words and phrases. For example, in a recent Smoothwall
integration alert, a student was logged as having typed something
inappropriate, but it missed other things he had written. Since this is a
significant safeguarding issue, can this be prioritised as an action for
Vital to look into?

Thanks

Hello,
I've had the bulb in my projector changed recently, but the image on my
Smartboard screen is now the wrong size. It's a smaller band across the
middle. I have tried a lot of things. Helen has also had a look for me. I
can't change it. I think it may be something Vital needs to do. Please
could you get in touch with them so they can have a look?

,T20240116.0093,ipad from Wigginton,"Hi

My ipad was taken last week so that X could be added to it.  Do you know
when it is going to be returned?

I was also wondering if ti would be possible to talk to someone about how
we can make the flow between different apps on our ipads work better.  For
example, if using edu puppets imovie, we should be able to upload the
pupils work to Seesaw directly but all of the permissions are wrong and it
just doesn't work.  It feels as though we are only getting half the benefit
of using ipads and is such a shame when the children have worked so hard to
not be able to share it.  If anyone is able to advise us on this I'd be
grateful.

Thank you,
Catherine

getting an error message (image below).  Our kitchen manager has spoken to
the School Grid Support desk who have told her that they believe that this
is an issue with an overnight change, possibly in security licensing on our
part affecting the wifi.

Could you please confirm if there have been any updates overnight to the
wifi that would cause this issue?

Since we returned after the christmas break, staff are having issues

Where these would normally open in Microsoft Word, they are opening in
Edge.  They are XML files but this has always opened as a word document.

Please can this be looked into and rectified as staff need to be able to
access these reports in the correct format.

and she can see me as having it shared and has tried multiple times to
share it again. There was a suspicion that the calendar had reached its
maximum people but there are staff who have joined just this year who can
access it and I have never been able to get on it.

FOR THE ATTENTION OF:   Katie Cole /Claire Grant

NAME OF SCHOOL:      Terrington Hall School





GENERAL KNOWLEDGE

INTER-SCHOOL QUIZ CHAMPIONSHIP 2023 – 2024



Thank you for registering your school for the National Keystage 2 General Knowledge Quiz Championship for 2023 – 2024 and we are delighted to confirm the details of your entry as follows:



Area Heat

Online GK Area Heat 1

Your passcode for the heat

4659

Date

19th January 2024

Time

10am - 11am

Number of teams from your school

1 Team/s from your school (if you would like more team places, please let us know)

Composition of team/s

4 players per team – 1 player each from years 3 - 6

number of Handset devices per team (Devices can be a laptop, PC, Tablet, kindle or phone with internet connection)



EACH PLAYER ON A TEAM WILL NEED A DEVICE AS THEIR PERSONAL HANDSET, WITH THE FOUR TEAM HANDSETS LINKED ON OUR SYSTEM TO PRODUCE AN AVERAGE SCORE ACROSS EACH TEAM.



This ensures that whilst the children are encouraged to confer, they ultimately select their own answers to the questions.



If your school does not have the devices available for each child to have one, this is not a problem – if you prefer to have just one or two handsets per team, the system picks this up and the scores are adjusted to account for this, so the team is not at any disadvantage.





Team Selection & Practice quizzes

To access your team selection and practice quizzes along with the answer cards, please go to our website by clicking on this link;



https://www.quizclub.org/team-selection-and-practice-quizzes



Please select the quiz you would like to play.  You will be asked for a password for the General Knowledge Team Selection and Practice Quizzes which is GKTPKG2324



We would recommend you copy and paste the password when you need to use it as it is both case and space sensitive.



We provide one general knowledge team selection quiz for Years 3 & 4 and one for years 5 & 6 in order to select your team/s.   These can be run on the classroom whiteboard for all the children, with the highest scoring child in each year group being selected to form the team/s to represent the school in the Championship. The quiz runs automatically, with the questions timed at 30 seconds each.  There are 20 questions in the quiz, each with 4 possible answers.  At the end of the quiz, the children are instructed (on screen) to swap their answer cards and the quiz then goes back through each question displaying the correct answer.



We also provide 4 narrated practice quizzes for your team/s, once selected, to play.  These quizzes are narrated by our quizmaster and can be played on any computer.  They contain 10 questions each, along with hints and tips on tactical voting, the process of elimination and working together as a team as well as some information on what the team can expect at the Area Heat.



Setting up for the Online Area Heat



BEFORE THE HEAT

  *   Choose where you want to run the heat from – this can be a hall, IT suite or classroom that has a good internet connection.



  *   To watch the quiz broadcast you will need to use a computer that is not being used as a handset. This computer should also have its speakers on, so your team/s can hear the Quizmaster presenting the show.



•  Ideally, you will also need one device per player that will be used to act as a handset (although schools that cannot provide one device per player can opt to have just one, two of three devices shared by the team if they prefer).  This can be another PC, a tablet, laptop or mobile phone.  These devices do NOT need the Zoom app on them.



•  On the day, the children will be accessing a website called www.buzzerpad.com<http://www.buzzerpad.com> on their handset devices.  You cannot set up the devices beforehand as the passcode to set them up is not given out until the quiz starts, but we would recommend, if you have not taken part in Quiz Club before, that you ask your IT manager to make sure that the www.buzzerpad.com<http://www.buzzerpad.com>  website is set up as a ‘safe’ website for the devices the children will be using so that the device’s security does not prevent the children accessing the website on the day.



ON THE DAY

  *   Please make sure the main computer you are using to watch the quiz on and the device/s you plan to use as handset/s are fully charged and do not have a ‘sleep’ mode set up as this could potentially interrupt your connection to the quiz.



  *   From the main computer you will be watching the quiz on, go to our website using this link:  https://www.quizclub.org/links-to-access-quizzes



  *   Click on the button for the online area heat you will be taking part in.



  *   This will take you to Zoom, where you will be asked to enter a passcode to take part in the quiz.  Your passcode is 4659



  *   You will arrive at a page with our logo and music playing and will see a message that the Quizmaster will be with you soon.



  *   You do not need to do anything else – the Quizmaster will join at the planned start time and will guide everyone through setting up their handsets.



AT THE END OF THE HEAT

  *   At the end of the heat, a number of the top scoring teams will be invited to take part in the Semi Finals of the Championship which will also be online.  The number of teams moving on from the online heat will be confirmed by the Quizmaster at the start of the quiz and is based on the number of teams taking part.



  *   As with all our heats, the children taking part receive a certificate to mark their achievement and these are available to download from our website at  https://www.quizclub.org/certificates.



The cost of your school’s entrance into the Championship

The cost of entry is £50 per team and covers your school team/s throughout the competition.  An invoice will be sent by email to your school shortly.



What happens next?

Your school now has a confirmed place in the Championship.  We will email you approximately 1 week before the Area Heat as a reminder of the date and time.



We look forward to welcoming your team/s online at the Area Heat.  If, in the meantime, you need to contact us our telephone number is (0207) 459 4111 or you can contact us on this email.



With regards,



AMANDA BLAIR

follows:

The far left one just wouldn't turn on. It was plugged in and nothing was
happening. The third one along was intermittent like a wire was dodgy.

These were brand new, installed in May 2023 I believe.

I would like to send you and quote of your website with prices showing you a few things to greatly improve these search results for your business website.

These things are not difficult, and my quote? Will be very specific. It will show you exactly what needs to be done to move you up in the rankings dramatically.

If you were on page #1, you'd get so many new customers/ every day.

We have helped 250+ businesses to get the top 1 rank at a very low price!

May I send you quote? If you interested.

Something is wrong when I try and print from school.  Sometimes I don't
have the printers available as an option and if I do it doesn't print.

,T20240115.0093,FAO Tom Muir,"Hi Tom,

Following on from our earlier conversation...............

We had a new printer installed a few months ago, printing from it was
unstable and we had to delete the printer and re-add it to get it to print.

Matteous (apologies for the spelling!) attended and put it on a fixed IP
address, which was great as we've all been able to print with no issues.

Since this happened I was unable to assign any Paxton key fobs and the
doors were showing offline.

On Friday, Gus from Tyrus came and looked at the issues with the doors. He
said that they were offline and he needed to assign an IP address to them,
he spoke to Marcus at Vital who said to assign them to any IP address
showing, which Gus did.

Since then we have printing issues, we are having to delete the printer and
re-add it, in my case this worked first time, but my colleague has had to
delete and re-add multiple times before being able to successfully print.

Would it be possible to have access to editing software on my desktop? I really need it to edit the student videos for Animal care.

I'm filming the year 11s second round of videos, and the year 10s first round, all within 4 weeks of each other over this term.

I edited the last ones at home but I won't be able to manage to edit all of these in my own time as there are over twice as many with the year 10s doing theirs as well.

I used CapCut for the recent edits and I'm familiar with it, would I be allowed to have access to this please?

,T20240112.0221,ipad issue,"Hello!

Since we started back on 8th January, one of the EYFS ipads that staff use
is not letting us log on to the WiFi, meaning that we cannot access
tapestry which we use all the time.  We only have one remaining ipad on
which we can do this.  Paul Layock, Headteacher, has tried to logon using
the Guest WiFit but this has not worked either.  Only the Tapestry login
page comes up, that is all.

The code on the back of the ipad is WIGDFE-01, I'm not sure whether this is
of any help.

Hopefully you can sort something soon!

Many thanks,

Caroline (EYFS Teacher)

Thanks again for your help this week, already the new iPads are helping the
situation.

I had 4 students this afternoon with problems.

Izzy Marsh - Showbie won't download from her 'Student' app

Amy Mustatea, Jacob McGrann and Molly Johnson all had problems with their
Google Login. They say they've all been to knock on your door this week,
but not found you yet. Please can you send me their email/usernames and
reset their passwords to PurpleBike123 so I can get them logged into
showbie before their next lesson.

Incidentally, I emailed Mrs Brabbs when we helped Charles earlier in the
week and I've had a lovely email back to say how much we are appreciated
for helping

happy weekend

Dave

Subject: Head Teacher log on

Hello

I called and spoke to someone earlier today as our Head Teacher Lauren Evans is unable to sign into the PC's at any of our schools, Staveley, Kirk Hammerton and Long Marston.

She is signed into her laptop a H Teacher but that doesn't work on the school PC's neither does L Evans. We believe because she doesn't have the correct access to log in at school, this is why she cannot print anything in the schools either.

If you could please create a log in for her for the schools that would be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks
Lauren

middle. I have tried a lot of things. Helen has also had a look for me. I
can't change it. I think it may be something Vital needs to do. Please
could you get in touch with them so they can have a look?

,T20240112.0022,Re: SIMS,"Hi Amanda,

My other suggestion would be to call School ICTS on 03452 226802 and log a call (options 1).

They could then remote onto your computer and have a look at the issue.

I think it is the same issue I have with sending passwords out from Sims (although this is only a small job and i can work around it)

There seems to be a glitch with Google.
I've CCd IT in, as this is now the third Markbook that is randomly
filtering incorrectly.

I have refreshed the Markbook, and the names now appear.
Giles, can you investigate if this is something we can resolve more
permanently?

Dear James and Sarah

Not sure whose remit this is but thought I'd start with you two. When my class came to the above room for our lesson today we found lots of computers without keyboards, keyboards moved around the room, and damage to keyboards - missing keys (see photos).

Just thought you should know. Or should I pass this information on to anyone else?

Hi All,

I have today received the resignation for Charlotte Harrison with immediate effect, due to her new employment position and also moving back to Hull to be near family.

I would be grateful if you can now do all your bits to remove Charlotte from all governor lists, school email and website, GIAS,SCR etc.

I will remove Charlotte from our list of governors on NGA, my list of governors, committee list, link governor list and new governor guide.

Kind regards,

I called and spoke to someone earlier today as our Head Teacher Lauren Evans is unable to sign into the PC's at any of our schools, Staveley, Kirk Hammerton and Long Marston.

She is signed into her laptop a H Teacher but that doesn't work on the school PC's neither does L Evans. We believe because she doesn't have the correct access to log in at school, this is why she cannot print anything in the schools either.

If you could please create a log in for her for the schools that would be greatly appreciated.

Dear Lucie



I have been in touch with my IT colleagues, and they have come back with
the following which will hopefully let you use the current system on
Sensory World.



It is a little clunky, but if your school allows it, install this extension
into Google Chrome -
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ruffle-flash-emulator/donbcfbmhbcapadipfkeojnmajbakjdc
.

The site should then load, and you can enter. The account login / creation
bit to enter the house or garden don’t seem to work, but if you right click
on the image and select Play it should let you go in and use the
functionality of the website. Hopefully enough for what you want to do.



Unfortunately, I do not know of any sites similar to this one.  I am
grateful to you though for raising this as it does indeed look like a great
resource, and we are now attempting to get in touch with the developers to
make it accessible again.  I will let you know if we are successful!



Please do come back to me if you have any further queries.



Many Thanks

Sue

I am an SEN teacher and have been recommended to use your sensory world
interactive activities and the sensory house.  Unfortunately, the only site
I can find was made with Adobe Flash Player, which is no longer in use.



Do you have an alternative site that has similar activities (such as
kitchen safety) that can be accessed or know of any other site that is
similar to this amazing resource?

Please see again the request from our technician for you to respond directly to him.

I'm slightly concerned that, despite me having emailed them directly, they won't respond (despite me adding the case number) because their system might work on replies to emails, rather than direct emails.

Would you be able to reply to their last support email and ask them to email me directly at je.clarke@vitalyork.com

Thanks

Hi Alex

Our technician has replied with the following:

""Hi Ian,

Thanks for passing this on to me, please can you respond and let them know that this method didn't fix the issue the last time we tried it?

Also, could you let them know the PCs are networked in such a way that they do not have a recycle bin to empty so this MAY have affected the fix not working.""

Thanks

I am teaching in there from 10am tomorrow for the rest of the day so would be handy to have it sorted by then.

I know the room is free 9-10am tomorrow morning if that helps with access for fixing.

,T20240111.0165,RE: Staff Padlet- Brad Winn y11,"Hi James

Can you look into this please as to why a student would have access to it on their browser.

Suzy - for your information I get an alert every time some on posts on the Padlet so would be able to instantly remove it. There's never anything confidential on the Padlet so it isn't a major problem students seeing it - but is definitely something we would want to try and control moving forward. Hopefully James can find out how Brad got access to it.

Many thanks

Hi Both,

Just to be aware- Brad Winn has just had the staff padlet on his internet browser- which appears as though he can see all the info on it... I'd imagine this is something we don't want students to have access to.

Claire he was about to publish something silly to it..... what action do you want taken?

Thanks

To: School Reception <reception@ahs.pmat.academy>


Good morning,



Happy new year!



My name’s Lottie and I’m an Account Manager at Softcat. I work with
multiple local schools and trusts and I’m hoping to expand my network. I
have included an attachment of my team going into more detail, and who we
are as a company.



As we begin a new term, I’m keen to hear whether I can be any assistance on
any upcoming projects for 2024 and provide competitive quoting and/or
benchmark pricing. Whilst I appreciate you will already have regular
suppliers, we can bring a lot of value, such as great vendor relationships
and specialists who can deliver tailored solutions to fit business needs,
free of charge.



If you have anything in mind, I’d love to arrange a call to discuss
further. Alternatively, I appreciate the next few weeks will be jam-packed,
so feel free to reach out at a more suitable time.





Kind regards,

Thank you for sending this email through to bring it to our attention.

Our IT Team has investigated what has happened and I can confirm the

to be a phishing attempt due to a leaked password on an expired user
account.  The student to whom this account belonged to left Manor in 2020,
and the account will now be disabled.

Apologies for any inconvenience caused, but thank you once again for

Is there scope in coordinating an internet service audit at Compass please?
We are receiving ongoing difficulties in our internet turning on/off in
addition to our printer facilities not linking in with our WIFI,
particularly in our nurture zone.

I logged this matter yesterday and I understand that this matter has been
logged previously, however, the situation continues and has been an ongoing
battle for as long as I have worked at Compass.

Could I ask that you look into the matter as a matter of urgency please as
this situation is impacting our ability to operate on a day to day basis.

If the issue falls with our internet provider, naturally, we can address
this matter with KC however, we require further investigations and support
to clarify why this issue keeps arising.

Kind regards,

I'm having real problems with working in the science workroom on a laptop.
The connectivity wavers in and out, and then sometimes stops being
connected when I'm in the middle of doing something.

Today I had spent 15 minutes editing a lesson, but then when trying to save
it the connection failed. My document then closed, and there was no edited
version in my files.

I've had problems every day this week. I've tried restarting the laptop,
and it made no difference.

Anything you could do I'd be very grateful.

Hi Alex

Our technician has replied with the following:

""Hi Ian,

Thanks for passing this on to me, please can you respond and let them know that this method didn't fix the issue the last time we tried it?

Also, could you let them know the PCs are networked in such a way that they do not have a recycle bin to empty so this MAY have affected the fix not working.""

Thanks
Ian

Thanks for helping. This is the email I received from Claire Mumford:

*Hi Rachel*

*In order to change your password for EduLink you will have to change your
Google password which will link to your email account and such.  They are
all linked through the school IT system.*

*Thanks*
*Claire*

I have successfully changed my Google password. However, when I then try to
change the edulink password, I put in my username first: r.sweeney. Then, I
click on 'reset login' and it asks me to add my email address, so I type in
r.sweeney@mce.hslt.academy, and this is the message I get (see below). Am I
doing something wrong?

,T20240110.0200,Printer Assistance,"Hi

Happy New Year!

I wondered if you could help add a printer to one of my colleagues' logins
please?

Her name is Emily Wright and she has recently started with us as an
apprentice. Emily can only send printing to the Riso machine which is great
for large printing jobs but not for emails etc.

Please can you add the office printer (AdminXerox)?

If you need to talk anything through with Emily she is in school Tuesday to
Friday from 8am until 4pm.

We are waiting on some laptops and one of these is for Emily to take
with her to college (I know Sally has already spoken to Lewis about this
earlier today).

Thanks

Vicky

I hope all that have had the chance to use the Smart screens over the past
few days have had a positive experience and I had lots of good feedback.

Chris Connelly from Elementary tech will be available this Friday lunch for
anyone who might like to drop in. He will be able for you to ask any
questions or solve any issues that you might have. He will not be
delivering a formal training session as you will all have differing levels
of expertise so please can you consider any specific questions/needs that
you might have before then.

Jimmy is going to set up the Smart software before Friday as well as making
sure that every screen is connected to the internet.

Regards

Stacey

Dear Parents/Guardians,

I hope this message finds you well. As we approach a crucial milestone in
your child's academic journey, we want to remind you of the upcoming
Parents' Evening scheduled for this Thursday.

This particular Parents' Evening holds significant importance as it marks
the last opportunity for you to engage with teachers, discuss your child's
progress, and address any concerns before the conclusion of the academic
year. For Year 11 students, this is especially vital as they prepare for
the next phase of their education or career.

Your active participation in Parents' Evening plays a crucial role in
supporting your child's academic success. It provides a unique chance to
gain insights into their strengths, areas for improvement, and overall
development. The valuable feedback from teachers can aid you in guiding
your child effectively during this critical period.

We understand that life can be busy, but we cannot emphasize enough the
impact your involvement can have on your child's educational journey. By
attending Parents' Evening, you not only demonstrate your commitment to
their success but also strengthen the partnership between home and school.

The event will take place this Thursday 11/1/23 from 3pm to 6pm. To
schedule your appointments with teachers, please follow the Edulink process
or request your child to make appointments directly with their teachers. If
you encounter any issues or have questions, our dedicated staff is
available to assist you.

We genuinely appreciate your ongoing support, and we look forward to
welcoming you at this final Parents' Evening for Year 11. Together, we can
ensure a strong finish to this academic year and set the stage for a
successful future for your child.

Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to seeing you on Thursday.

Best regards,

Mr Moore

Hi Steph,

Just to let you know Owls computer has no internet. I know foxes does - not
sure if it’s to do with what the Vital man was doing this morning or the
general wifi problem? It was working first thing this morning.

Rosla. I don't seem to have found them all even though I have had a few
goes. They also seem to ungroup every now and again and we lose a few. Is
there a way to know which ones/do it without getting the kids to log on and
then find them?
Our Year 11's are proving to be using them to disrupt the lesson and game,
the issue is they need them for their coursework otherwise we would ban
them from them.
Any ideas how to make the group on impero work would be appreciated,

Dear Parents/Guardians,

I hope this message finds you well. As we approach a crucial milestone in
your child's academic journey, we want to remind you of the upcoming
Parents' Evening scheduled for this Thursday.

This particular Parents' Evening holds significant importance as it marks
the last opportunity for you to engage with teachers, discuss your child's
progress, and address any concerns before the conclusion of the academic
year. For Year 11 students, this is especially vital as they prepare for
the next phase of their education or career.

Your active participation in Parents' Evening plays a crucial role in
supporting your child's academic success. It provides a unique chance to
gain insights into their strengths, areas for improvement, and overall
development. The valuable feedback from teachers can aid you in guiding
your child effectively during this critical period.

We understand that life can be busy, but we cannot emphasize enough the
impact your involvement can have on your child's educational journey. By
attending Parents' Evening, you not only demonstrate your commitment to
their success but also strengthen the partnership between home and school.

The event will take place this Thursday 11/1/23 from 3pm to 6pm. To
schedule your appointments with teachers, please follow the Edulink process
or request your child to make appointments directly with their teachers. If
you encounter any issues or have questions, our dedicated staff is
available to assist you.

We genuinely appreciate your ongoing support, and we look forward to
welcoming you at this final Parents' Evening for Year 11. Together, we can
ensure a strong finish to this academic year and set the stage for a
successful future for your child.

Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to seeing you on Thursday.

Best regards,

Mr Moore

We have scheduled a SIMS update/release for tomorrow (Thursday) at 5 PM. It
is recommended that all users remain logged out of SIMS during this process.

We will send an update email tomorrow at 4:30 as a reminder.

The process of upgrading doesn’t take long (around 30 minutes) – you will
see install notifications from what is called the Solus3 agent.  Once you
see that the update has been installed, you can log back into SIMS.

Please feel free to leave office or classroom teacher workstations switched
on - this will ensure you get the update.

Happy New Year! ☺️

After the presentation at the Vital conference, I signed Badger Hill up for
an account, using a Vital team member's email address. I can't remember
whose email I used thought - sorry! Did you get an email from Adobe about
our school account for Adobe Express? I'd love for the children to be able
to use it, as one of our year groups is starting a unit of work on editing
digital images this half term.

Please let me know if you can help, or if there is anything further I need
to do!

Nicky Ellis's number  806644 is receiving calls from outside lines which
she hasn't made ie someone is calling a parent and they are pressing redial
and the number is Nicky's phone.
I think this is the Hub number - second phone which was added (Handheld
phone)
Please could this be looked at and amended so that return calls are
directed back to the main school office.
Nicky's phone needs to continue to have the return call from her own number.
Hope this makes sense?

Not a showstopper but I don't have the clock displayed in the bottom right
corner of my toolbar. It's login specific, as a colleague's logged in on

Hello. The Sumdog apps have released a new version of the app and the app
that is currently on the iPads are old. How do we download new apps onto
iPads? Do we need to request it through the IT team? Going to the website
no longer allows us to have full access to the program anymore.

Thank you
Miki

Hi Liz,

I hope you’ve had a lovely Christmas and New Year.

I have been trying to access my Ebor email and Google drive account to
check my emails etc and I am unable to access it on my phone and laptop.
I’ve tried different internet connections and they all show me the message
below:
[image: image0.png]
I’m not sure if this is something you can help with as I have been able to
access these on school computers in the last week of term so I have had
access already. It might just be I’m not allowed if it’s not on the school
network.
I just don’t want to miss anything before next week.

I will get my training done on the learning hub by the end of this week.

Thank you for any help you can give me and enjoy the rest of your week.

Thanks
Antonia

I wonder if you can help please. I need to show Y13 a set episode of a TV drama and, since it was removed from the iplayer, I've been using Daly Motion for the past few years. Now it's saying I can't access; it may be that the site no longer has the clip, but would you be able to check for me that it's not the firewall stopping me access, please?
Many thanks.

I'm delighted to help.

Having looked into it, Jake's iPad is a 1st gen iPad Pro, which according
to the Apple website should run iOS17.
I will have a look at that in the morning.

I'll get back to you on Friday with where we stand with the iPads.

With kindest regards

the students please? I had planned to use a site this mornng and discovered
it was blocked for them but not for me. In the meantime please could you
tell me if students would be able to access this link below (and if not is
it possible to unblock it (ideally the whole of the wordwall site as there
looks to be quite a few good science games on there)?

no longer be used by him.

I believe the email was ssi@mce.hslt.academy

I can't control access to this account because the email was not linked to

I've spoken with the following students this morning and taken the
following action:

Tyler Watson-Cameron - says it's still in repair:
>>Now repaired so should be OK

Cassie Garforth - says mum has taken it to be fixed
>>Correct. I did ask but Cassie didn't know when the iPad would come back.
I will check again later in the week and email home to try and find out
when the iPad will come back.

Henry Delap-Mason - says school normally provides a stock iPad but there
weren't any today:
>>Correct, will ask for an iPad in future.

Lucy Keeling - Has a new iPad bought on the scheme through school but the
template didn't work on her version of GarageBand and there are no updates
available.
>>Will check this in the morning.

Jake Mock-Lewis - His iPad is too old to run the current version of
GarageBand
>>iPad is 1st gen iPad pro, model number A1584, currently running iOS16. I
can't help further with this.

I will check with the students again on Friday.

Can we have a chat sometime soon re overdues, computers and charts ...
I know you have sorted out the system for the data base - but I just
dont understand how to set up the system so that it automatically sends
mails.b

Also - computers in the library - we have one functioning one now. Are
there any old ones that we can have to replace the completely broken ones
..its a real problem with pupils coming in to do homework at breaktimes.

Thanks

,T20240108.0248,IPads for Learning,"Hi new Vital colleague (so sorry I don't know your name yet),

In the year 7 class I've just taught (7SJ Music) 5 students didn't have a
working iPad. I only have 3 music devices to lend out, so 2 students
couldn't access the curriculum today.

The 5 were:

Tyler Watson-Cameron - says it's still in repair
Cassie Garforth - says mum has taken it to be fixed
Henry Delap-Mason - says school normally provide a stock iPad but there
weren't any today
Lucy Keeling - Has a new iPad bought on the scheme through school but the
template didn't work on her version of GarageBand and there are no updates
available
Jake Mock-Lewis - His iPad is too old to run the current version of
GarageBand

It was Cassie and Tyler who didn't have access today

Are there any more stock iPads I can borrow as we start this production
project. They all need the latest version of iOS and GarageBand, and also
the Sibelius and Showbie apps

thanks very much

Dave Lowe

It will be in the Nest which is being turned into a meeting room.

Hi all,

This is just to inform you that Rachel Garbett resigned as a staff governor on 18th December at our last Full Governing Body.

Please can you do all the necessary bits to remove Rachel from your list of governors including the school website, SCR, Information about schools etc?

Paula, we can chat about running another staff governor election when I see you next and also think about timings thinking about your capacity for this.

Kind regards,

Jo Olsen (she/her)

Hi Babs



Hope you had a lovely Christmas break.



Another school has had the same issue (funnily enough another Ebor school –
All Saints in Hessle).  I’ve reported this to RM and said same as your
issue but they’ve had even more bits changing, and this is RM’s response:



This looks like the record is being over written by a saved entry in the
browser, and this might happen without the user noticing, if they have
autoupdate and auto correct on.  Checking reference 304 I can see that the
entries changed when the record was edited on the 15th and again on the
21st.

It appears all the edits are being made by the same user so it does suggest
a browser issue on their PC.



I would make sure the school are definitely clearing cache on exit and also
only using one browser session at once for Integris



All Saints are going to get their IT support to check their browser
settings.  I assume you have the same IT support?  If so, if they find
anything, it would apply to you as well.



We’ll keep an eye on things and if it keeps happening will get RM to
investigate further



Best wishes



Karen

Hi Ann



Hope you had a lovely Christmas and New Year break. I have being trying to
delete my Hempland Gmail account but to no avail.

After some internet research it appears that if your G mail was with a
college, school or an organisation then it is for the administrator

to delete the account . Therefore please could you find the time to delete
the account.



Yours Sincerely

Hi Dani,

If you go into Office.com and go to account settings and security you can
add a new device in there, Basically follow the instructions used to set
MFA up but set up an additional device and they once complete you can
remove the old device.

Thanks

Please could you send me some instructions on how to change a device for
MFA.  I've got a new phone and I'm still having to use my old phone for MS
Authenticator.  I'm sure I won't be the only one that gets a new device for

We have a new starter at HMO, Sarah Green, who is having some technical
difficulties. She cannot access email or drives from home as the system
didn't ask her to authenticate when she first signed in at school. Are you
able to check this please?

I sat with her at the end of last term to go through the process but it
just allowed her straight on to her emails from school - the problems then
came when she tried to get on from home over the holidays.

please can I check whether I should be able to receive emails from  @
nationalcollege.com
I have tried to reset my password on the site, but nothing has come through
from them. The site suggests that this my be because the filtering system
on the school's system blocks emails from the National College. I have
checked my junk email folder and there is nothing in there either.
Please can you advise?
Many thanks,

The installation of these screens will introduce a new dynamic to T&L
within the Academy.
It would be good if we could have an informal supportive network where you
can share tips and shortcuts as well as ask for support.

Hello

Just to let you know, there is a fault with the Manor phone lines.  On
lifting the receiver there is a ring tone, but when you dial 9 for an
outside line, the message 'LN not assigned' comes up on the phone screen.

I've contacted Gradwell who are talking about flashing lights on ISDN boxes
🤷.  Lee and I located what we think this is, and I have advised Gradwell
there are no flashing lights.

I'll put a note on the website advising parents to contact us via email
rather than phone.

,T20240102.0113,Re: Proxy for student at St Oswald’s,"Hi there,

I'm so sorry, I accidentally sent a draft email! It should have read:

Hi there,

I hope you're all well! I have a child in my class who now has a phone that is used to monitor her for health reasons. Her mum has recently spoken to Russ Goodwin who has said that the child will need a proxy to access the internet with her phone. Mrs Dunne (Headteacher) has granted permission for this access.

I was wondering whether someone might be able to help us to get this set up as soon as possible?

Many thanks,
Emily Walton

Hi there,

I hope you're all well! I have a child in my class who now has a phone that is used to monitor her for health reasons. Her mum has recently spoken to Russ Goodwin who has said that the child will need a proxy to access the internet with her phone.

will need a proxy to access the internet with her phone but that the school needs to give authority for this to be shared/Molly to have that.

If this didn't work, Russ has said that the filtering may need to be looked at by CYC but that it is possible to get Molly up and running.

Russ said if you raise a ticket with Vital and put his name on there, he will assist in getting things sorted for school and Molly.

I'm regularly reading long documents in my role and would like to be able
to listen to these. I have figured out how to convert a pdf to word and can
load into the immersive reader.

What I'd prefer to do is use the online version of word as this will allow
me alter the reading speed as it's too slow. The cloud version also
allows me to alter the nast accent of the reader too which would be
preferable.

Please can you help with how I can do this?

Hi Rachael,

The staff email addresses aren't problematic to be shared with a pupil, but
the attached quote includes names and details of the company/staff
providing a quote which ideally we shouldn't be sharing without a
legitimate reason.

Please could you ask the Vital team/IT technician to remove the email from
the pupil's inbox? (We may be able to catch it before he's clicked on it
that way) If not, then yes I would suggest asking the pupil to delete the
email.

Many Thanks

,T20231221.0059,Duplicate request for unblocking of sites essential for students to complete exam board summative assessments,"Morning Craig
Here is the proof that the trust appears to require for the simple
unblocking of websites that are integral and essential to their Y12
qualification in Criminology.
The screenshots of the spec indicate that students need to make 'fake'
social media sites as part of their controlled assessment, the screen shot
of WJEC CPD also indicates this and makes it clear that the students are
able to access the internet during this section of their assessment.  The
access to the internet is so that students are able to access imagery and
sites exactly as I have already requested to be unblocked.

Thanks for your help with this Craig, I imagine the process is as
frustrating for you as it is for me and the students.

Hello,
 
I’m hoping you might be able to help me? I work for North Yorkshire Council’s I.T System Team and have been assisting a cook at Bishopthorpe Infant School gaining WiFi access to her kitchen tablet.
 
This has been outstanding for a while; I believe this was looked at by one of you engineers in passing, whilst visiting site on other business. There was intervention required from the supplier at the same time to enable connectivity, however this was not achieved.
 
I’m looking to arrange a re-visit in the New Year for a date and time, in which one of your engineers, myself, the member of kitchen staff and the 3rd Party supplier (Civica) are all available to resolve this.
 
Please can you advise re. availability for this, if there will be a charge for an ‘ad-hoc’ visit (and if so what this would be)?
 
Kind Regards
 
Jonny

Brownson <simpson.e@sfx.npcat.org.uk>, Mr P McNally <
mcnally.p@sfx.npcat.org.uk>



Good morning everyone,
Please note below the following staff changes for after Christmas:

Eliza Chmielewska will be leaving employment at SFX as a cleaner as of
05/01/2024.  Please could you process the following actions and let me know
when you have done so, so that I can update her Leaver checklist:

Tom - Please can you lockdown her IT and email accounts as of 05/01/2024.
Becky - Please can you revoke Eliza's Arbor access and change her status to
a leaver from 5th January.
Pete - Please can you deactivate her staff lanyard.
Anna - Please can you close her Parentpay account.
Emma B - Please can you update the staff list on the website from January

Also from January, Charis Blease has requested to be known by her maiden
name of McNally. This is in the process of being changed legally but in the
time being she has asked if her name can be changed around school, in much
the same way that Stephanie is known as Quinn.
Therefore please can the following changes be implemented:

Tom - Please can you change her email account to mcnally.c@sfx.npcat.org.uk
and link this with her current blease.c@sfx.npcat.org.uk account. We also
need to make sure this new email is linked with the attendance group email.
Becky - Please can you change Charis' surname on her Arbor profile.
Anna - Please can you create her a new staff lanyard.
Emma B - Please can you update the staff list on the website from January


Thank you and Happy Christmas!

I am aware you are busy today with internet issues etc but... Meri was in
today from Pindar and she showed us a media drive they have at Pindar which
is a shared Google folder, which has films uploaded into it for each
department. Could we have one of these please? I know teachers in English
would find it helpful with films such as Oliver Twist, Lord of the Flies,
Macbeth etc... We used to have a media server but it has gone since the IT
issues.

Thanks,
Alethea

Over the Christmas period please may I request that the pastoral office is
moved from its current location to the conference room on the ground floor
in Deepdale. We need this space to be workable for the first day back. We
are also moving A2S (now called the reflection room) to the closest room on

classroom and requires no additional work to set this up.

Ian, there are currently 7 desks in the pastoral office which will need
moving to the meeting room area in Deepdale. How would you like staff to
put their belongings together to make this as easy as possible for your
team? There are a couple of filing cabinets and a bookcase as well that
will need taking over as well please.

Andrew, are you okay to move the IT over to this new space during the
training day so that computers are set up? We are also appointing a new
colleague to the pastoral team so can you please set up a new computer
station on one of the desks. Can you also move the chromebook trolley to
the new reflection room on the first day back please?

The waste toner cartridge in the Reception copier came up as full today. We
went to get a new one from the Repro room but the only ones there are used
ones. We had to take one out of another copier as we had urgent work to
copy. We now have no waste toner cartridges in school unless you know where
there may be some. If the Reception one comes up as full again we will be
really stuck.  Please can we get some ordered as a matter of urgency
please. Can we also make sure we have spares of the actual toner
cartridges also.

Many thanks.

use of it in Music. Some of them can get on but it is blocked for others -
even when they're signed into google chrome and their account is synced.

As shown to you, 3 students in Mrs Sweeney's class are having trouble with
continuing to read their ebook through the ebook platform by Wheelers,
which we subscribe to as a school. The books are Alex Rider Snakehead,
Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone and also the Order of the Phoenix
too.

All the books are age restricted each month they are refreshed. Therefore,
I don't understand why smoothwall is blocking the text.

R Sweeney - In the meantime students might want to borrow the hardcopy
version of each book to continue to read their chosen book.

Thanks in advance for looking into it Ben.

Best wishes,

Monica

Afternoon,

Could you unblock a couple of sites for me.

1) Chesskid. We've used this before, particularly during lockdown, and it's
a safe way for the children to play against other users. Our school chess
teacher has managed to get gold accounts for the children in our chess club
and it would be nice if they could access them at home. Here's the blocked
screen.

https://www.chesskid.com/

[image: image.png]

2) Safesearch kid. Bizarrely, this is now blocked. It's one of our go-to
sites, on the rare occasion that we ask the children to search the web. We
normally direct them straight to sites using Classroom links.
https://www.safesearchkids.com/

Here's the screenshot of this block.

[image: image.png]

Hope that helps. Let me know if you need any more information.

Thanks

Dan

,T20231212.0086,V Drive problem - Ongoing,"Hi

Sorry to contact you yet again but the V Drive access is still causing me
lots of issues, please note that this is when I have not started up the VPN
for the old payroll system.

I can access the V Drive, then after about 5 minutes or less it does not
allow me access.  If I am working on a spreadsheet, I can't save the work
unless I save to my desk top.
[image: image.png]

Occasionally after a period of time it will allow me to go back in again,
but only for a short period of time.

I do not have this issue when I am in the office, or when I am using the
old laptop (event though it is extremely slow)

I don't like to bother you again, but I do not have the time to keep
logging on and off, or wait until it allows me to access the V Drive
again.  Could there be a problem with the new laptop, connectivity? I am
able to use the internet for everything else, so I don't think that can be
an issue either.

Hoping we can get this sorted out ASAP please.

Thanks

,T20231212.0080,Smoothwall Monitor onboarding meeting,"Morning,

We have bought Smoothwall Monitor for our 3 schools via the NYC and now
need to book an onboarding meeting with Smoothwall to get it all set up.
They've advised that as it's a technical onboarding meeting, we will need
someone with access to our networks etc to support getting it set up
(they've said it's server/device support people they need, not broadband
support, so it would be you rather than NYC).  They've sent the link below
about what they will be covering in the meeting:
https://monitorhelp.smoothwall
.com/hc/en-gb/articles/6802168852380-How-to-install-Monitor-on-Windows-devices

Would someone from your end be able to attend this with me please?  The
next available dates are in the new year, see dates at:
https://calendly.com/cloud-and-monitor/smoothwall-monitor-technical-deployment?month=2023-12.
I'm hoping to get it done asap, so would be looking at the slots in w/c 8th
Jan - current availability on the link is showing as:
Tues 9th - 10am, 10.30am, 11am
Wed 10th - 10am
Thurs 11th - 11am, 11.30am, 12noon (I'd rather avoid Thurs if possible)
Fri 12th - 10am, 10.30am, 11am, 11.30am, 12noon

They've said it shouldn't be more than 2 hours.

,T20231212.0015,Re: S4 Computers,"Morning Giles

Dan has raised similar concerns as I raised with you a short while ago.
S4 is the main teaching room for Computer Science and will currently have
class sizes of 30 and potentially 32 moving forward.
Please can S4 and S5 be fitted with at least 30 PC's and ideally 32.

Let me know when this work will happen so that I can schedule relocating
classes.

,T20231211.0177,Chrome Book Audit at Wigginton Primary School,"Hi,

I have recently completed a Chromebook audit using the list you had provided me with.

We have 1 chromebook where the service tag sticker appears to have been removed and there are 3 chromebooks on your list that are not in school:

Service tags: C6CVFB3; G6QJ8C3; 5CD052JGP8; 5JX8593

I am aware that we often send any that are not working to you for mending/ checking. Do you have any of the above chromebooks? And is there a way to check the service tag when the outside sticker has been removed. In future if any are sent back to Vital we will asking the person collecting them to sign for them, something we haven't done effectively in the past.

With kind regards,

Clare

,T20231207.0180,Carla Quarless,"Hi there,

We have a new Head of English across both Millthorpe and YHS Laurence
appears to have created a Google Account for her on Tuesday. Looking at the
audit logs it looks like she was automatically suspended, possibly because
she hasn't officially started yet so I'm guessing the system the trust uses
is suspending her account because of that. Is there anything we can do
about that? I know for us with Wonde we can ignore a user to prevent
actions like that.

Additionally when she is added to SIMS at both Millthorpe and YHS how could
we synchronise the accounts? It's likely she will need access to Google
Classrooms for both schools and we aren't sure how this would work, or if
it's ever been needed before. Could email aliases be a possible solution?

Thanks,

Hi Holly



You recently set up an iPad for us to have imessage and facetime
functionality. Unfortunately we are currently unable to use it as it's
requesting an apple ID which we don't have and aren't able to set up.



Please could you advise?

,T20231129.0051,Urgent: Persistent Computer Issues,"Good morning, I am writing to express my ongoing frustration and concern
regarding the persistent technical issues with the computer in my classroom.

Despite previous attempts to address the problem, my computer continues to
cut out during lesson inputs, displaying an error screen. This issue has
been raised multiple times, and while assurances have been given that it
has been fixed, the problem persists. I want to emphasise that this
recurring problem is significantly impacting the learning environment in my
classroom.

As you may be aware, the interruptions caused by these technical glitches
force me to stop and reteach concepts within a lesson. This not only
disrupts the flow of the class but also hampers the progress of the
children. The inconsistency in the functionality of the computer is
hindering the delivery of lessons. I appreciate your prompt attention to
this matter and look forward to a swift resolution. Thank you, Nathan

Hi Michelle

We now have a 3D printer in school and are unable to connect these to the wi-fi due to it being a 'hidden network' I really don't understand much about this but that was what Adam has told us when he was in school on Thursday!

Therefore, we do need to use a USB pen drive to transfer the file from the teacher laptop to the 3D printer. It comes with its own pen drive which will only ever be used for this purpose.

Is this something that can be sorted to enable us to use the printer?
