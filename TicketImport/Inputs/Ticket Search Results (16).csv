As per the attached CLoA your current retailer is BT and new retailer is BTIPEX and both the columns show BT Address. This is the reason we asked you if the service ID: 01904659726 associated with the billing account MY59998112 was switched over to Cloud.

As per your email below, since you are paying a different company for the phones now and no longer use BT's services, would request you to please share a document from the new service provider stating the number has been ported over to them and the port date.

Once received, we'll then take the required action to get this resolved for you.

Until then, collections follow up for this number will remain suspended and no one from collections team will chase you for any outstanding amount.

I look forward to hearing from you!

,T20240530.0128,Permission to use laptop at home,"Good afternoon,
One of my team members is using one of our 'supply' designated laptops as
she is a supply teacher covering one of my colleagues who is absent due to
illness.

I rang earlier to ask if her laptop could be given permission to be used
both in and out of school as she now needs to complete school related work
during holidays and so at home.

He laptop code is:
ST: FT07Y93

If this could be done before the end of tomorrow that would be great as I
am aware she is coming into school tomorrow and can restart her laptop a
few times to change the protocol and allow it to work at home from then on.

Thank you,
Tom Dennis

Hi,

Yes the multi factor authentication is all fine but it still asks me for a
password whenever I try to login and comes up saying invalid login.

I tried to login today using a recent link I got sent to access my payslip
and after the multi factor authentication it still asks me for a username
and password.

I am sorry to ask, I have a Chrome Flex however, this will not enable me to
complete the student planner work from home and as I am in appeals this
week, my work on the planner needs to be completed out of the time the
school is open.

I can assure you I will return this on Monday and appreciate this

Hi Hannah

Random question. I usually work from school to save distraction from my
little chaps at home. I am enrolled to be an examiner from AQA this summer
- is the school network safe/can I complete any marking at school after
school hours?

Many thanks

Subject: Mobile Guardian Renewal


Dear Kirk Hammerton C of E Primary School School,

REF: VM36653

We're emailing to remind you that starting June 1st, 2024, some of your older iPads with iOS versions 12 and below will no longer receive support from Mobile Guardian, and will be automatically removed from their management after this date.

Once Mobile Guardian removes these devices from their platform, you might lose access to any apps or photos stored on those iPads and it’s important to back up your iPad as soon as possible to avoid any data loss.

If you're unsure which devices are affected, please don't hesitate to reach out to our helpdesk on 01609 536086 for assistance.

Hopefully a quick question......

When I use my own laptop for Remote Desktop, I can't find a way of running
the Remote Desktop on 2 screens through Duplicate/Extend mode (although I
can do this for my own laptop).

Is this because Duplicate/Extend mode of the Remote Desktop is not possible
as the Remote Desktop is running through a browser?

To: hflavell@ahs.pmat.academy <hflavell@ahs.pmat.academy>


Good afternoon,



We have recently issued an email to the reporting contact on your Police
CyberAlarm registration form. The email sent was explaining that you are
not an active member of Police CyberAlarm, as our system has triggered a
flag, concerning your Police CyberAlarm Data Collector.



The original email (included below) received a bounce back from your mail
server. This occurred as the email address associated with your Police
CyberAlarm account was incorrect, these details have since been updated to
this email address. Could you please confirm that this is the correct email
address for correspondence regarding potential vulnerabilities and
notifications from the Police CyberAlarm service. If you would like to
update these details, we are able to assist with this, alternatively, once
your collector is back up and running you will be able to review all the
contact details associated with your Police CyberAlarm Membership.



Please see below for the original email:



*Thank you for completing the registration process and becoming a member.
Our records indicate you have installed and registered your Data Collector,
however your Police CyberAlarm Report has triggered a flag on our system
that currently your collector is not supplying data.*



*Police CyberAlarm works by analysing the data that you send to the
collector, this has allowed the service to help stop live attacks, help
resolve thousands of vulnerabilities and to provide detailed advice for
securing member networks. Unfortunately, if no data reaches the collector,
we are unable to provide the service level we would like to.*



*We are aware that some members have not completed the last step of the
setup or may have had issues with the configuration of the collector or
their firewall logging. To assist with this, our support engineers will be
running several web meetings for organisations over the coming weeks.*



*If you are available and would like one of our team to help with the setup
of your collector, please respond to this email with the contact details
for the person you would like us to work with and we will get this set up
as soon as possible.*



*Yours sincerely,*



*The Police CyberAlarm Team*





Kind Regards,

*The Police CyberAlarm Team*

Account still not working. I can log in with hthomas on the school PCs, and the password I set up is correct. I have also added my own mobile temporarily as 2FA, which works fine. But, if I try on my own laptop (and Huw on his own in Plymouth), via Chrome, we get the following. I can see the email address shows up correctly in admin.teams, so cannot see what the issue is.

Me again...sorry

Is there a reason why Spotify seems to work on the school web browsers
sometimes and not others. It was working P2 today but now is giving this
message...

[image: image.png]

Doesn't seem to be a spotify issue as I am playing it fine on my phone.
Just seems to be an issue when played through the web browser. And, again,
not always.

,T20240523.0246,Re: New starter,"Hi Mike,

I'm so sorry to backtrack after you've put in the leg work, but having
caught up with Meg and met Calvin/mum, I think he is going to need to go
into the nurture group - or at least be in A band to access the Applied
Learning pathway. Meg may well have spoken to you about this already.

Calvin hasn't been in education for the past 9 months and was struggling
with his education prior to this. He has ADHD for which he will be
expecting to take medication when he returns after half term. Mum has
suggested he is accustomed to having 1:1 support in school previously and
has asked about whether we will honour this here. I have explained if he
does go into nurture there will be at least 2 SAs in there supporting. Meg
spoke to the family preemptively about nurture and mum is really keen for
this, thinks it is what Calvin needs.

Please can this be considered - it would be great if we can finalise things
before he starts on Monday. Apologies for the short notice, I've only had
the chance to meet with mum just now.

Thanks,
Jessa

Hi all



I am unsure who I need to contact about this. I would like a Laptop for Seb Kilbride to be able to do online Maths tuition with a tutor at home.



The tutor has asked to ensure Seb has a laptop with a built-in mouse/USB mouse and he will provide the Teams and Whiteboard Link.



Please can you advise/tell me how I action this request?

Subject: Laptop for online learning

Hi all

I am unsure who I need to contact about this. I would like a Laptop for Seb Kilbride to be able to do online Maths tuition with a tutor at home.


The tutor has asked to ensure Seb has a laptop with a built-in mouse/USB mouse and he will provide the Teams and Whiteboard Link.



Please can you advise/tell me how I action this request?



Thank you

Ronnie

The new mouse has definitely helped but has not solved the problem fully.
The PC is extremely slow and it takes forever to open applications such as
SIMS. Even when open, waiting for it to search takes forever.
Could you please have a look?

I am at my desk for more or less the rest of the working day.

,T20240523.0163,Sign in system not working,"Hi there,
Our electronic sign-in system doesn't appear to be working again.  The ipad
allows you to sign in but when you look on the app or the PC, it says there
is no-one signed in.  Julie has gone into the settings on the ipad itself
and it comes up with 'Your device is offline'.
I wonder if someone could take a look at this asap?
Many thanks
Lisa

Before you started with us we bought 2 tablets to use for oncall. We
decided not to use them so they should be somewhere in the IT office. Can

Hey

I was wondering if you could check cameras for me about Michael Kersey.
Around 13:11 yesterday Michael ran past my room with an arc student after
I’d left Michael out for the toilet and was adamant it was not him. Just
wanted the back up before I logged a C4 and called home.

I have emailed Lesley and included James, the issue has been passed to him. On Friday we found another loop in Cayton and a few machines with bad patch cables. Any errors we were seeing on the Meraki are now clear.

Hopefully we spot something between now and next week.

,T20240522.0284,Fwd: EBORA - SSO Issue (1142261),"Hi

Myself and Neil had a meeting earlier with iTrent to try and find out what
the issue was stopping me from logging into the ESS. I believe it's
affecting quite a few people across the Trust, Neil has a log of who.

Amir worked it out and he's put it together in an email below.

Myself and Neil said we didn't want to go ahead with option 2 on my account
as that would mean Neil doing that for everyone user when option 1 might be
better.

So, passing over to you to decide. I'm happy to test anything for you if
needed.

Thanks

Good afternoon,



Thanks for your time earlier.



As discussed, Louise was attempting to log in with l.jackson@ebor.academy,
however, the value (unique identifier) that Azure (Entra ID) is passing
back to iTrent is l.jackson@eboracademy.onmicrosoft.com



When you had the SSO scoping call, as per the requirements email, you
specified that you wished to use Email as the Azure unique identifier.



The options to resolve this are:



   1. The correct unique identifier needs to be specified as part of the
   SSO App config in Azure or the Email value in Azure for each employee needs
   to be updated to reflect: l.jackson@ebor.academy
   2. Or the ‘User Email’ field against the User iTrent account (User
   Details) needs to be updated to reflect the value that Azure is sending.
   i.e. l.jackson@eboracademy.onmicrosoft.com



I will update the case to reflect this.



If you need any further input from me, please email me directly.

Subject: Mini common room


Hi Martyn,



Please can we use the mini common room as a mini work room?



We would move 4 computers in there and the desks that we have in J01-J04. Combined with the office chairs from the workroom.



We thought it would make an ideal quiet working space for us to use and facilitate small group teaching with year 13s leading up to their exams.



Please let us know at your earliest convenience.



Thanks.



Matt.

I wondered if you could have a look at my login? I am new to the whole 'One Drive' life so have asked a few people to show me what I'm doing with it, but when they come to my computer screen (I've logged in on numerous computers now) they are confused with my set-up. They say its almost like I've not been added to Teams or One Drive? When i try to log into Teams via the computer short cut, it tells me that i cant log in from a school?

,T20240522.0168,Guest Account Request,"Hi mate,

Is there a way you could set up a guest account for when we have visiting presenters?

I would only need one. I would log in on all machines required (usually 6-8 different PCs), download the PP on incogneto, and then just open up the PP from downloads on the machine.

Does that sound OK? Ideally, it would only give them limited access...no sims, class charts or emails.

Could you let me know if this is possible, and the log-in when set up?

Cheers

If IT Support can not find an answer we will have to use the previous

keeping this year's paper for the Yr11 Mock. Unfortunately, these are our
only options given the newness of the course.

Hi Holly,

After some further discussion, we have decided that this user can have
Amazon Prime unblocked for a set time period.

So, please could Abbie Seavers at Hempland Primary School have Amazon Prime
unblocked from Wednesday 22 May - Friday 24 May. After this date, the site
will need to be blocked again.

Hope this is all ok.

,T20240522.0135,Re: IP address,"Hi Tommy,

They all have the same amount of cameras. Let's just go for DVR-1 (This
sits on: http://10.68.229.181/)

An available IP is: 10.68.224.65 with a /20 prefix length.

So the subnet mask is: 255.255.240.0

I will need the mac address of the camera so I can add a reservation in
dhcp.

Thanks,

Jimmy

The Wifi isn't working properly in the annexe and hasn't been since 13th
April and I understand that it was reported on the 29th April. It's still
not working properly to the point where students who use a chrome book in
lessons are not able to complete their work. Please can you provide us with
an update on the progress we are making with this?
We have endpoints assessments which will involve full classes using chrome
books after half term and I'm concerned that these won't happen if the Wifi
isn't up and running.
We have Trust deadlines to meet with the assessments so it's really
important that these are completed on time.
Many thanks for your help with this.

Is there any chance you would be able to drop off and pick up Rob Osman +
10 Y8 girls on 26th June? They need to be at Amey Consulting on Tanner Row
at 9am and will be done about 3pm. Happy for them to be dropped somewhere
near and walk the rest (will need to know for the evolve), but I'm not sure
there is anywhere suitable for Rob to park and leave the minibus if he
drives himself.

Thanks,

Subject: IT problem, Xander H (12SRe) - please could you pass to
appropriate person/department?
To: reception <reception@archbishopholgates.org>


Good morning,

Xander Hudson (Y12) has the use of a school Chromebook as a reasonable
accommodation to support his learning. A couple of weeks ago something has
happened and he discovered that when he tried to use the Chromebook the
device appears to have been been blocked or locked. He has also tried to
access the Windows PCs in school and gets a similar message, so we think
that his user account (18hudsonx) is the problem rather than there being an
issue with the device itself.

The only devices in school that he is currently able to use are the Music
department Macs (thank goodness he can use those at least, as they are in
the middle of lots of composition work for the music a level on them!). It
looks like his user account might have been inadvertently locked in Impero,

He has tried to resolve this - I think a number of teachers have emailed,
presumably, the IT department on his behalf and he has tried to contact the
technicians directly but unsuccessfully so far. He doesn't have any
permanent free periods to go and find people to try and solve things like
this because he's doing five subjects and has a full timetable!

Not being able to use the Chromebook allocated to him for his written work
is starting to become a problem and if we can get it sorted I would really
appreciate it as I don't want him to fall behind, especially in the run up
to the Y12 end of year mocks.

With thanks in advance
Kat Chandler (Xander's mum)

,T20240521.0334,Guset login for a mediation tomorrow at 12.30pm,"HI there,

Would it be at all possible to give me a guest log in for a parent to be
able to log into a chromebook at Burton Green Primary School tomorrow for a
tribunal meeting with the local authority?

We require two computers, one for staff and one for the family.  The family
obviously cannot login using their own device, they do not want to hotspot
from their phone as this would not be a stable connection and I cannot
login for them due to GDPR in case they accidentally accessed / saw my
emails etc.

I will aim to give you a call in the morning too to see if this is
possible.  I do not think we can sit around one small chromebook for such
an important meeting for three hours.  The sound quality would not be good
nor would it be conducive to the meeting.

Many thanks

I emailed yesterday saying that my ipad wont allow me to log in. I can do
that now but now it won't let me email photos from the iPad  to my pmat
account so that I can put them on the end of year reports. This has never
been an issue before. If they can't be emailed, please can you advise me of
how I can move the photos from the Ipad as we can't connect the iPad to the
laptop either!

Hi,

Me and my colleague Megan Garwood are unable to log into our iTrent
accounts. We have used the correct password and it does not work.

I have used the link sent with payslips email but it takes me to log into
microsoft and will not let me log in. Megan has this issue as well

I have tried to log into the authenticator app and it will not let me log
into that either.

I have attached an image from my authenticator app and when trying to log
into microsoft online it gave a similar message.

Please can you help.

Thanks

Samantha Jones is having issues accessing ITrent and we think it might have
something to do with her MFA App as Ebor said it shouldn't ask for her
password and the MFA app doesn't come up at all to give an option to put a
one time password in.

Is it possible to reset her MFA settings so we can redo the authentication
process with the QR code to see if this solves the issue?

Subject: Saving to C drive

Hi Carl and Giles

I'm currently on a training course where I need to be able to save files to the C drive in order to be able to make the most of this training.

Carl came to my PC during the coffee break to give me access to the C drive but I need to be able to save to it both now and in order to be able to create templates on Office and SIMSin the future.

My training this morning has been compromised because I haven't been able to save to C:

I don't want to mess about with the data held in C: but please can I have the rights to save files there, ASAP.  Preferably before the afternoon training session begins - I know that Carl is busy today and I will also be feeding back to the company to say that this should have been made clear before we began as it's a real pain not to be able to fully take part.

Thanks
Claire

Subject: Saving to C drive

Hi Carl and Giles

I'm currently on a training course where I need to be able to save files to the C drive in order to be able to make the most of this training.

Carl came to my PC during the coffee break to give me access to the C drive but I need to be able to save to it both now and in order to be able to create templates on Office and SIMSin the future.

My training this morning has been compromised because I haven't been able to save to C:

I don't want to mess about with the data held in C: but please can I have the rights to save files there, ASAP.  Preferably before the afternoon training session begins - I know that Carl is busy today and I will also be feeding back to the company to say that this should have been made clear before we began as it's a real pain not to be able to fully take part.

Thanks
Claire

Hi Mel
It has been very helpful to have the old headteachers email come to me over the last few months. Can I ask to inform Vital that we want the forwarding facility on this email (that gets sent onto my chris.nichols@york.gov.uk<mailto:chris.nichols@york.gov.uk>) to end at the end of this academic year Friday 19th July. With a bounce/return response on it to say that this email is no longer being used/accessed from Monday 22nd July 2024. This email is the Head.Danesgate@Danesgate.yorkschools.net<mailto:Head.Danesgate@Danesgate.yorkschools.net>

The new email on the school website is the one we will use from Monday 22nd July 2024: danesgatehead@danesgatecommunity.org.uk<mailto:danesgatehead@danesgatecommunity.org.uk> I don't want this published on the return response as there is SOOO much junk mail that comes through. Mel: you will continue to check this for me (but would like Lynn to take this over on her return!)
Thanks
Chris

I'm having a hard time accessing my account via chromebook, I have typed my
full email address into the email box, and entered what I know to be the
correct password, but I am getting a message as though my credentials are
inaccurate.

I spoke to a colleague about this and they said they have had a similar
issue that Vital were able to fix! I'm emailing in advance of some clinics
I need to attend via zoom which a chromebook would be ideal for!

Thanks ever so much

Hi Jimmy,

It actually looks as though Yngrid is not synced to Seneca at all as she has no email address in the MIS.

Please could the correct school email be added as the 'primary' email for Yngrid, I can then pull this through in another sync :)

All the best

Hi Jimmy,

I've just completed a manual sync for the school which should fix this issue if it has been updated on the school's MIS.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can do for you :)

I'm not sure why we are still having so many issues each day, but it is

We’ll be attending St Lawrence C of E Primary School tomorrow, approx. 10am to install the first two devices, would it be possible to request some Wi-Fi access in advance, so I can continue with the setup and testing?

I’ll be available on my mobile, should anyone need to speak with me: 07985255047 and I expect us to be onsite for approximately 2-3 hours total.

Thanks for the help provisioning the server, this’ll help us no end with the rollout.

,T20240520.0137,Work missing from the world/network in L40,"Hiya -

On Friday I raised that Y12s were missing files that they had saved in
their world. In the Y9 lessons we've had today more students are saying
their work is missing from the world - I know that for at least some of
them this is correct as I have saved it in there myself.

Rachid can you think of why this might be the case? As far as we are aware
the documents and files in the world should not be affected by wiping the
harddrives of data, so this suggests there may be something else going on?

Thanks
Zoe

Hope you had a good break the other week.

I think we have managed, or are managing, most of the broadband / Internet issues via NYES so hopefully your team hasn't had to get too involved at YHS as we hoped would be the case.

We do seem stuck with one issue though that is causing us problems. Our franking machine stopped being able to communicate due to the switchover and so we have had to send all mail since by sticking on stamps, which is both costly and time consuming.

NYES haven't been able to resolve and we are unsure what progress they have been able to make.

Any help your team can offer with this issue would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,

Good morning all

I am having issues logging into my itrent to complete my timesheet for last
week. I had this issue at home on my personal laptop on Friday but assumed
it was to do with me logging in on a personal device. I have just tried on
my school laptop but I am getting this screen.
Please can you help? I don't want to miss a deadline for my timesheet!

Many thanks

 I tried to attach them to this email, but cannot due to sharing
permissions! Previously, I've downloaded them all to word using a pc and
attached them that way.  Is there a simpler way please?  Any help, much
appreciated.

Thanks, Alison

I'm able to use google lens to translate using my teacher ipad but it
doesn't work with the children's ipads.  Is there a reason for this or do
they just need updating?
It would be very useful to have this working on at least one of the
classroom ipads asap as we have a non-English speaking child who has just
started in our class.

Hi Jill

I know Nick messaged earlier on in the week about the DofE kids coming in
June. We are looking to make it earlier now - April. Would you have
availability for the 13/14th April? There are only six kids and probably
three staff.

Thanks

,T20240517.0198,Supernormal AI app,"Hi Rob

I gave myself permission for, and installed, Supernormal which is an AI app
that records meetings and provides notes and action points afterwards.

It's not brilliant but impressive enough to show lots of promise - but has
fallen foul of the trust's strict data protection rules, so I am no longer
allowed to use it.

But I can't seem to be able to get rid of it and in an important meeting
with the DfE yesterday it asked for permission to 'join' the meeting, which
this was refused. It did lead to embarrassing questions in the meeting
itself though.

I've tried to search for it on my device but can't find it. Can you help?

Thanks

Tim

Hi all

I am unsure who I need to contact about this. I would like a Laptop for Seb Kilbride to be able to do online Maths tuition with a tutor at home.


The tutor has asked to ensure Seb has a laptop with a built-in mouse/USB mouse and he will provide the Teams and Whiteboard Link.



Please can you advise/tell me how I action this request?



Thank you

Hi Janye,

I've already signed up for this using my @carrjunior.southbank.academy
email - However, since we have changed internet providers ALL AI websites
have been blocked??

I'm not sure if you can do anything about this? I have tried my end - but
don't seem to be getting anywhere?

Thanks

Hello Kerry,

Apologies for the late response.

This is regarding the query ref - 539545 that has recently been assigned to me.

I have checked the service ID associated with the billing account MY59998112 is 01904659726.

The attached document shows the line was ported out from BT to BTIPEX. Could you please confirm if you switched this line over to Cloud.

If yes, then please share the BT billing account number of Cloud so that we can take the required actions to resolve your query.

I look forward to hearing from you!

,T20240517.0112,Google Waffle - 9 Dots - URGENT,"Hi all
This is causing a real issue in the classroom!!
Not a real problem for admin staff - Just an annoyance

Obviously the dots have disappeared
And most staff have to just type Google in the address bar and then they
get the google homepage and the 9 dots are back and they can get to their
email / calendar / etc.

BUT the students don't really uses these
They use Classroom and Sites and Sketchup

[image: image.png]


These only appear when you are ""logged in"" as the education licence
If you just type in google then it is not properly logged in and you don't
get the ""education tools""

[image: image.png]


So the students have to google each tool and then sign in to that
Very frustrating

Subject: Another OneDrive problem

Hi,

I've got another child here who is unable to sign into OneDrive. The account is arbristow, the device is CYJ2HX3.

As you can see in the screenshot below, OneDrive did not sign in when he logged into the laptop. I try to log in manually, but I get the error message shown in the screenshot. He is able to access OneDrive through the web browser, but neither he nor I really understand how that works in terms of saving and editing files - we want to be able to access his files through File Explorer in the normal way. Do you have any suggestions about what is going wrong?

thanks,

Please can we reset Alisons login password, it's been the same for years and she would like to change it, but doesn't know how

Also can we take 'Alisons printer' which is located in my room - actually are we able to rename that to 'SBM Printer'?,  anyway can we stop availability for everyone and only allow admin to use it? Teachers are using it to print in colour and its expensive - plus we have two other printers for teachers to use

Hope that all made sense?

Many thanks

Really sorry to send another email but a colleague of yours who came to
Alderman Cogan did an amazing job on Wednesday by sorting a few things.

He connected my iPad to the Smart Screen but I can’t connect my board to
the Wi-Fi to allow me to screen share but I could yesterday.

Could I have some details or assistance in being able to do this please?

Again, a huge thank you for the work on Wednesday.

It’s really appreciated,

The same thing has happened again.

This is nearly month on month now.



The report doubles up the figures and then the following day they are blank.

Can this be fixed?

Hi Caroline,


Please ask your IT guys to reach out and look at your PC its not getting any of the mapped drives either, you should have one for SIMS and OFFICE. I've looked at the policies on the network and can see you should have one:


[https://schoolicts.halopsa.com/api/attachment/image?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6ImE0YmYyMmQ0LTgzYjYtNDAwZS04MWZkLWQ3N2ViYWU0NzU2OCJ9.XTkI_9PWRwwx4lgJhy5-yC7Mfrrx7mM_SeSc1SNDNyw]


This might be why you have lost FMS as the config file for the database selector usually lives on the F drive.

Please reply to this e-mail to respond.


Thank you.

Hi Katie

I'm not sure who sent the recent confidential email but one of our staff
estephenson@cwr.pmat.academy seems to be included in an email group?  She
has reported that she receives all group emails from AHS but has deleted
them and we have asked her to delete from her ""bin"" also.

We've let vital know to check the group emails and take her out but thought
you needed to know.

Hello Michelle

How are you?

Sorry - I know you've had a lot of questions from me recently.  This is a
little one - how can I password protect a PDF file?  When I try to it asks
me to sign up for a free 7 day trial.  There is a free one if you go to
Adobe's website, but they ask you to have an account.  How is everyone else
doing this?

Thanks

I still regularly have students who cannot access their Google gmail or
Classroom due to the Privacy issue.

Sometimes moving a student to a different computer can allow them to gain
access however my choices are limited when I sometimes have half a class
that this affects.

This is an ongoing issue and is causing problems for teaching
electronically.

Thanks
Sarah

I'm so sorry to ask, as I think you could have already sent me this (but
I'm not sure if this was last year!)
Can you ask Vital for a copy of our class login details for the chromebooks
please? I'm going to try and get them up and running! Wish me luck!

Hi Matt,

All iPads on our site still not connecting to Seesaw.

There is one small iPad (Della’s) that is also saying that Seesaw is the
outdated version. It looks like we can still use Seesaw on this iPad,
however, the function is limited and it will need updating to the newest
version.

Subject: Chromebooks in seclusion
To: L Henderson <l.henderson@gra.hslt.academy>


Morning,

I thought I'd check with you first, is there a problem with the chromebooks
in seclusion getting onto google classrooms? I've had a few students saying
that they can't access the work as it either doesn't connect or says the
memory is full. Just wondering if this is an actual problem or they're just
trying to get out of doing the work!

Hope you're ok and not too busy!
Kind regards
Philippa

 CrowdStrike has alerted behaviour on the host 'MCE-H15-SC01'. The process has been killed. 
 Details on the alert are as follows:
 
 Description: A productivity application unexpectedly wrote and ran an executable. This might result from a malicious macro in a lure document. Investigate the process tree to find the originating file and look for similar files delivered to other hosts. Detected: May 15, 2024 14:01:20 local time, (2024-05-15 13:01:20 UTC) Host name: MCE-H15-SC01 File name: WINWORD.EXE

 From the alert it appears that user accessed the file, 'plants and Ecology SoW LWL.docx', and performed DNS requests to the following links:

 Investigation found the links to contain suspicious indicators such as the file, 'TextInputHost.exe', reading security settings of Internet Explorer and the potential Corporate Privacy Violation from 'msedge.exe'. Although the process has been killed. Please review and verify this activity.

Subject: Windows 10 upgrade coming soon - how to time your two-hour upgrade
To: All CYC Staff <AllCYCStaff@york.gov.uk>


Dear colleagues,



*Windows 10 upgrade coming soon*



Over the next month all CYC issued laptops and desktop computers need to be
upgraded to the latest version of Windows 10 (22H2) to ensure our systems
are secure. The upgrade will take approximately two hours so we advise that
you make sure it takes place when you don’t need access to your computer.



*What you need to do*



When your computer is due to be upgraded, you will see a pop-up message
headed *Windows 10 Critical Update* as below:





**Please note: We would recommend that you upgrade your computer at the end
of your working day, ensuring that any laptops are *plugged in and charging*.
Once the upgrade has started *DO NOT SWITCH OFF YOUR LAPTOP/PC*
**

Follow the instructions in the Windows Upgrade Guide
<https://colin.york.gov.uk/besupported/ict/software-and-systems/windows-10-upgrade/>
 which includes screenshots to guide you through the process of setting the
time for your upgrade. If you don’t set a time, your computer will
automatically upgrade after a named time and date.



*Support*



For any queries relating to the upgrade, please email
CYCLaptopUpgrade@york.gov.uk.



For some devices with limited data storage capacity the upgrade may not be
possible remotely. ICT are aware which devices these are and will contact
you to resolve this. Be aware that we may need to arrange for the upgrade
to be done from West Offices.



Thank you for your support



*ICT team*

I have created a shared drive for our trust science curriculum. I want the
drive to be view only to all staff but also that they can download the
folders to their school drive to be able to edit. I think I have set it up
like this already but just wanted to check. Also how do I make the shared
drive visible to all staff in the trust so that it automatically comes up
on their shared drive list?

Kind regards
Dave

Couple of issues to flag with you please :

I cannot seem to print from my laptop today - either oto my office printer
or to the Main Ebor printer

Second issue is on the main drive, the google chrome shortcut seems to have
gone.

Thirdly - Lindsey is having to use the office network cable for her laptop,
so I cannot use it in the office PC - any idea where we are on resolving
getting internet on Lindseys laptop.

P.s The switchover to the internet is causing problems still!

,T20240515.0098,Problems with OneDrive / Sharepoint,"Hi,

I'm having problems again with OneDrive/Sharepoint on one of the children's accounts.

She has gone into powerpoint, and saved a number of presentations in her Documents. I asked her to upload one of these to Teams so she can present it to the class, but when she tried to upload from her Documents folder, there are no presentations in there. After ten minutes of experimenting, I discovered that Teams and File Explorer are showing her OneDrive folder as 'Documents', but Powerpoint uses some folder on Sharepoint as 'Documents', and the two folders don't appear to be syncing (not sure if they are meant to?).

Could you jump on a remote session and help me make sense of this? I don't know why it's done it to her, and none of the other children - she's only 8, I don't think she's been going into any Windows settings and messing about with default folder settings! I've got the laptop logged in as her with me, and am available for the next 40 minutes or so.

Hello, I have been locked out of my school email address o[image0.png]n my phone and for some reason can no longer access it, I tried deleting the account and reinstalling it on my phone but got the same message telling me to contact vital York. Is that our IT provider and are you able to put me in touch with someone who can help me with it?
Thanks so much

I am hoping you can help me with a problem that has occurred this week on
my google account. When I open chrome on my computer (also tried on a
chromebook & different desktops in school) and the 'new tab' appears, the 9
dots you click on to access my google suite apps doesn't appear anymore -
so to access my emails or drive I have to search it into google. Do you
have any idea how I can get this shortcut back onto my home screen when I
open google chrome?
I've attached a screenshot so hopefully it makes sense what I am on about!

,T20240514.0336,iPads at Leyes Site,"Hi Matt

I got round to this slightly later than I thought however the iPads have now been split into 2 group, one group for each site. The settings are almost identical except from the proxies being different, so the correct proxy is deployed to each site allowing the devices to have Staff access to the internet.

I will arrange for Mateusz to come to site tomorrow as these iPads may need to connect to an unfiltered network to pick up the new settings from the management system, Mateusz can do this by tethering them to his phone briefly which will allow them to pick up the changes.

As soon as it's sorted, I'll email you back to let you know they are up and running.

Any issues or questions let me know!


Kind Regards,

Rob

I was wondering if it's possible for me to access the music login on my own
login without having to switch between the two? The students save work on
there and it'd be good for me to be able to listen without either doing it
at a separate computer or having to log out of mine and keep switching if
that makes sense!

Claire and I weren't sure what it was you wanted us to measure on these
speakers but time is running out to place an order so if you get a minute
to nip down and show me then I'll check! :)

Subject: Windows 10 upgrade coming soon - how to time your two-hour upgrade
To: All CYC Staff <AllCYCStaff@york.gov.uk>


Dear colleagues,



*Windows 10 upgrade coming soon*



Over the next month all CYC issued laptops and desktop computers need to be
upgraded to the latest version of Windows 10 (22H2) to ensure our systems
are secure. The upgrade will take approximately two hours so we advise that
you make sure it takes place when you don’t need access to your computer.



*What you need to do*



When your computer is due to be upgraded, you will see a pop-up message
headed *Windows 10 Critical Update* as below:





**Please note: We would recommend that you upgrade your computer at the end
of your working day, ensuring that any laptops are *plugged in and charging*.
Once the upgrade has started *DO NOT SWITCH OFF YOUR LAPTOP/PC*
**

Follow the instructions in the Windows Upgrade Guide
<https://colin.york.gov.uk/besupported/ict/software-and-systems/windows-10-upgrade/>
 which includes screenshots to guide you through the process of setting the
time for your upgrade. If you don’t set a time, your computer will
automatically upgrade after a named time and date.



*Support*



For any queries relating to the upgrade, please email
CYCLaptopUpgrade@york.gov.uk.



For some devices with limited data storage capacity the upgrade may not be
possible remotely. ICT are aware which devices these are and will contact
you to resolve this. Be aware that we may need to arrange for the upgrade
to be done from West Offices.



Thank you for your support

SIMS is being EXTREMELY slow and causing EduLink not to work.  Please can
someone look into this as a matter of urgency as without them both, we have
no way to register pupils this afternoon.

I've phones SIMS ESS and they say there's nothing wrong at their end so it
must be local

I got in contact last week to report my chromebook not connecting to the
school printers. Somebody, Jamie, I think, came into school to fix it.
Unfortunately I am still having issues. It will print one thing or nothing
at all. When it does print it's in black and white even when I have asked
for colour. Also I have been checking printer status and it's saying the
printer failed, I have cleared items in the list and will try again but
still no joy.

Thanks Kate

Hi Mel,

Unfortunately, contrary to what you have been told by Vital, we are currently unable to provide any user details for users accessing web content.

North are currently developing a new tenanted Smoothwall system which will give schools autonomy to control and report on their own users, however we don't currently have that functionality.

Please also note that these notifications report attempted access that was blocked.  These can still be used to inform your safeguarding policy and management/supervision of users.

Kind regards

,T20240514.0160,Looked after child laptop,"Good afternoon,

I wondered if you could help me.

We have been given a laptop by another school, it was bought for a girl who
is a looked after child out of her funding so it is for her to use, the aim
being out side of school, she will take it home and use it for
homework/research etc.

Please can you advise me of what we need to do to the laptop to make it
secure to comply with filtering and monitoring but also so she can actually
access her google account etc.
It is set up from her other school at the moment as she is dual registered
but she will need to access Compass (and eventually Aspire Academy where
she will transfer to) documentation, log ons etc.

Hi Caroline,

You’ll need to have a word with someone on your IT team, it sounds like
Google docs is not correctly exporting the file to pdf. As you’ll have seen
from my email, those pdf files should be about 60 times smaller once
exported.

I’m happy to talk with them if you want to put them in touch.

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for your reply.

I create the newsletter on a weekly basis using Google docs. I then
download it as a PDF and then we upload it onto the website. I’m not sure
why some weeks it is a different size PDF when nothing is specifically
different.

I don’t choose the size of the file size so I’m not sure how we can export
to a sensible size pdf before uploading.

Thank you,

Hi all,



Thanks for your time earlier.  To confirm:



   - You wish to use your Azure AD for iTrent authentication using SAML2
   giving you SSO.
   - Not all employees who need access are setup in Azure.
      - 50% of the schools are done
      - TBC on timeline on the remaining schools
      - The SSO project may need to be pushed back accordingly @Nicola
      Martin <Nicola.Martin@mhrglobal.com>
         - Customer has suggested September
      - Currently your staff use iTrent Native to authenticate
   - Synchronization from / to iTrent and AD is not required. You will
   continue to create accounts manually.
   - Chatbot is not in use yet
   - Web Recruitment is not in use yet
   - On-Boarding is not in use yet
   - A short outage is required on the day of the consultancy
      - Please check your Engine status after the outage
   - Currently your Consultancy dates are with myself on
      - 6th of July 2023 *ONLY*
      - Due to the customer already being live and this change affecting
      the user experience a *second date is required*.
      - Therefore day 1 will be for non live and day 2 will be for Live at
      least a week after the first date.
      - @Nicola Martin <Nicola.Martin@mhrglobal.com> please see above re
      pushing the consultancy date back and then a second date being required.



You will need to create 3 Non-Gallery SAML SSO Apps in your Azure tenant
with the following settings:

EntityID : https://ce0854de.webitrent.com/shibboleth

ACS: https://ce0854de.webitrent.com/Shibboleth.sso/SAML2/POST



Please use the Persistent Name ID Format.  Unique Identifier should be Email



Please follow the guidance in the attached SAML Client Partner document.



We will need the metadata once this has been done.



Please also provide a spreadsheet with the following:

Subject: Windows 10 upgrade coming soon - how to time your two-hour upgrade
To: All CYC Staff <AllCYCStaff@york.gov.uk>


Dear colleagues,



*Windows 10 upgrade coming soon*



Over the next month all CYC issued laptops and desktop computers need to be
upgraded to the latest version of Windows 10 (22H2) to ensure our systems
are secure. The upgrade will take approximately two hours so we advise that
you make sure it takes place when you don’t need access to your computer.



*What you need to do*



When your computer is due to be upgraded, you will see a pop-up message
headed *Windows 10 Critical Update* as below:





**Please note: We would recommend that you upgrade your computer at the end
of your working day, ensuring that any laptops are *plugged in and charging*.
Once the upgrade has started *DO NOT SWITCH OFF YOUR LAPTOP/PC*
**

Follow the instructions in the Windows Upgrade Guide
<https://colin.york.gov.uk/besupported/ict/software-and-systems/windows-10-upgrade/>
 which includes screenshots to guide you through the process of setting the
time for your upgrade. If you don’t set a time, your computer will
automatically upgrade after a named time and date.



*Support*



For any queries relating to the upgrade, please email
CYCLaptopUpgrade@york.gov.uk.



For some devices with limited data storage capacity the upgrade may not be
possible remotely. ICT are aware which devices these are and will contact
you to resolve this. Be aware that we may need to arrange for the upgrade
to be done from West Offices.



Thank you for your support

When Sophie Hemsley logs onto her number to see what is stored for printing
it comes up with 2 documents (4 sheets) which is correct  but then when it
prints it is printing out numerous pages of nothing.

Looking at the log I have highlighted a couple of anomalies that do not
seem right.

I have scanned in and highlighted the error lines and also the pages that
are printing out when Sophie tries to print her work

Please can you have a look into this for me so that Sophie can print her
work

I'm having some trouble with SMART notebook.

The notebooks are very slow to open and load, sometimes it just doesn't
happen at all.

I opened a notebook at 8.05 this morning and it did not open until 8.37.

There are no error messages; it just does nothing until it eventually opens
(if it does open at all).

Do you have any advice?

Thanks,

restarting, shutting down, etc.

I’m involved in SATS this morning but will desperately need access this
afternoon. Johnny was on site yesterday dealing with issues with Michaela’s
laptop not connecting and I wonder if it’s the same problem?

Hi Caroline,


Please ask your IT guys to reach out and look at your PC its not getting any of the mapped drives either, you should have one for SIMS and OFFICE. I've looked at the policies on the network and can see you should have one:


[https://schoolicts.halopsa.com/api/attachment/image?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6ImE0YmYyMmQ0LTgzYjYtNDAwZS04MWZkLWQ3N2ViYWU0NzU2OCJ9.XTkI_9PWRwwx4lgJhy5-yC7Mfrrx7mM_SeSc1SNDNyw]


This might be why you have lost FMS as the config file for the database selector usually lives on the F drive.

We still have one problem with our telephone network.
When I have a call and I need to transfer to the head's office, I press the
direct dial button to ask if they are free and then place the receiver back
down (onto the home position). This normally transfers the call to the head
office.

Currently, when I place the phone handset back down, the phone
immediately reigns again. I pick it up and the caller is still on the
office line.

Can you help with this?

To: All CYC Staff <AllCYCStaff@york.gov.uk>


Dear colleagues,



*Windows 10 upgrade coming soon*



Over the next month all CYC issued laptops and desktop computers need to be
upgraded to the latest version of Windows 10 (22H2) to ensure our systems
are secure. The upgrade will take approximately two hours so we advise that
you make sure it takes place when you don’t need access to your computer.



*What you need to do*



When your computer is due to be upgraded, you will see a pop-up message
headed *Windows 10 Critical Update* as below:





**Please note: We would recommend that you upgrade your computer at the end
of your working day, ensuring that any laptops are *plugged in and charging*.
Once the upgrade has started *DO NOT SWITCH OFF YOUR LAPTOP/PC*
**

Follow the instructions in the Windows Upgrade Guide
<https://colin.york.gov.uk/besupported/ict/software-and-systems/windows-10-upgrade/>
 which includes screenshots to guide you through the process of setting the
time for your upgrade. If you don’t set a time, your computer will
automatically upgrade after a named time and date.



*Support*



For any queries relating to the upgrade, please email
CYCLaptopUpgrade@york.gov.uk.



For some devices with limited data storage capacity the upgrade may not be
possible remotely. ICT are aware which devices these are and will contact
you to resolve this. Be aware that we may need to arrange for the upgrade
to be done from West Offices.



Thank you for your support

,T20240513.0170,RE: Instant notification.,"Hi there,

I'm really worried that we are not receiving the information to allow us to monitor any inappropriate content.  We are receiving the notification from ICT at CYC but then nothing further through vital.  KCSIE has made it clear to schools that we need to have appropriate filtering and monitoring systems in place.  However, I can't do this as the monitoring is not there.  Therefore, I unable to conduct appropriate safeguarding procedures.

We receive the details sometimes of the computer which has been used but really I need to know who has logged in and when so that this can be challenged with the individual.

Where do we go from here?

Morning Helen.



I’ve been on the phone to “Integrity” this morning to try and sort out my
internet connection. He spent an hour taking remote control of my computer
but hasn’t been able to fix the issue.



He believes it’s a security issue with whoever has set up the new internet.



I’ve not heard anything from anyone and don’t know what else to do.  Please
help!

Hi Richard
You came into Applefields a while ago and looked at google slides for me. I
was having an issue with not being able to move images. You sorted it or so
we thought. I am having the same issue again and other touch screen games
don't always work. Games are temperamental, working sometimes. I also tried
using a powerpoint presentation  saved on the PC  on the  touch screen that
did work and I went to use it again and it wouldn't work.

Consolidated Workstation Patch 2 fault code.

Dear Colleague,

ESS have advised that there is an issue with consolidated workstation patch 2, which is triggering a fault code Cannot find Table 11 or 12  in SIMS when you are trying to generate the school census.

An amended patch (Consolidated Workstation Patch 2 - School Census Early Years & DAF) has been supplied by ESS and this has been released to your school via SOLUS.

The next step to take is to request that your IT team run the updated patch by following the process below:

Where School ICT would normally carry out your upgrade we are scheduling this upgraded patch to be deployed.  The fileset will then need to be reimported once this has been applied.

  1.  Open SOLUS3 Deployment UI on the server - Usually located as a desktop icon.
  2.  Navigate to Settings | SOLUS3 | Updates and run a 'Get Updates' button, making sure that 'from the last 3 months' has been selected in the drop-down menu.  You should see a box appear; please make sure that consolidated workstation patch 2 is included

[cid:b3ec7c4b-c36e-4700-80b1-cf2f00989ec6]

  1.  Restart the SOLUS3 deployment service within services.msc.
  2.  Download and re-deploy the patch.
  3.  Apply fileset 2701 again
  4.  Fileset 2701 is suitable for uploading the return however the DfE are aware of some important flaws in this version and have dealt with those for COLLECT validation and reporting.  ESS will provide fileset 2702 to deal with these issues but it will not be released until after census.
  5.  Schools therefore have the choice whether to upload the census on Fileset 2701. Once the file is uploaded the revised validation and reports will be applied in COLLECT and more accurate results will be provided to the school for them to take necessary action.
  6.  Schools can wait for Fileset 2702 to be made available and can use the revised validation and summary report to take action before the return is uploaded to COLLECT.  If this choice is taken then schools would expect to receive results from COLLECT validation and reports that are in line with the results the received in SIMS.
  7.  We will make Fileset 2702 available as soon as it is released to all schools.

If you require  further support please reach out to the helpdesk in the usual manner.

Should you need any further support, please contact the School ICT helpdesk by emailing: helpdesk@schoolicts.co.uk<mailto:helpdesk@schoolicts.co.uk> or calling: 0345 222 6802.

Vanessa,

Typically it is installed on the SIMS server, if they uninstall the tool it

task scheduler and delete any jobs that are set for GO 4 Schools.

Also how do I stop the task scheduler?

Some of my students need to complete the survey for Andrew Wilson. I can
almost guarantee that some of the students on my list will not know their
passwords. Would you be available to come to the library during form time
to reset these. I just think it might be quicker and easier than sending
you emails as each student suddenly remembers that they don't know their

Hi.

I need to get my students' coursework to a location from which Louise can access and take them, so that they can be uploaded to an exam board website. We did this with GCSE work last week and it took some time as I e-mailed shared folders from each student with Louise, via e-mail, and they had to be individually downloaded and renamed, etc. Can you think of a better way?

Subject: £5 suppliment for FSM

<s.stump@voy.hslt.academy>


Ive noticed again that there is at least 1 child who is FSM but can spend
£5 a day. ive told my concerns to IT on more then one occasion but nothing
has been done. Also the children who are FSM it no longer states they have
a supplement price showing on the system which makes it impossible for us
to tell how much they have spent. This was always on the system before so i
dont understand why its not been put on. Stacey can you please try and have
a word with IT about sorting it out. The boy on the till is called Jason
Marshall if you can look at him on the system and see if you can see why
this is happening. because some of the children are not showing a
supplement the till can allow over spend without money been on there.
luckily one of the girls has picked up on it today but i have no idea how
many children this is going on with and how much over spend could possibly
happened.
Kim

,T20240510.0052,Issues with line going straight to VM,"HI. We are having issues with a line that's going straight to VM after only ringing once.  Ext: 2316

We do need the device to go to VM if the line is busy, but not sure why it's always going to VM even though the portal says ring for 120 seconds before transferring.

This is causing significant issues so we would really appreciate speedy advice and/or resolution.

Dear Colleague

Last month we changed the way you access our secure website, Interchange –
users now need to access Interchange via our single sign-on service, My
Cambridge, and then set up two-factor authentication.

We’ve identified that the *users listed below* from your school or college
have not yet set up their two-factor authentication.

If users do not do this, they will not be able to access Interchange or any
of the services that are linked to Interchange – for example, to submit
centre-assessed marks, make claims for vocational qualifications such as
Cambridge Technicals or access Active Results, our results analysis service.

We know how busy the next few weeks will be for you and your colleagues so
we would encourage you to make sure colleagues who need access to
Interchange or its associated services are set up as soon as possible.

For support and guidance, take a look at our FAQs
<https://customersupportteam.cmail19.com/t/y-l-mldiikd-dukkvhuit-r/>.

Thank you again for your support at this busy time.

With best wishes

*Customer Support Team*

Interchange users ‘at risk’

The following users have not yet set up their two-factor authentication for
Interchange. Please ask them to follow the instructions on our webpage:

Dear Stuart,

A child in my class has started learning souvlakia online. Sometimes these lesson will need to take place during after school care however, the website seems to be blocked. It is called preply.com and has been found by the parents and approved by them for use. I was wondering if you would be able to unblock it so I am able to assess it at school? Thank you in advance.

Best wishes,
Ellie

Please can you start setting up accounts for the attached list of 128 x
year 6 students who will be joining us in September?

They will also need Arbor accounts setting up please (as year 6 pupils) so
we can start downloading CTFs as primary schools send these to us.

What was the outcome of discussions with Danielle and Becky on how we can
set these students up on Arbor without causing any synch issues?

Becky will also add info from the data sheets (later in the summer term
after exams have finished) once the Arbor accounts are set up.

Anna can then set up Parent Pay accounts.

Thanks, Julia

Do you hold an inventory of all hardware, laptops, iPads, Chromebooks,
screens etc for each school?

We hold inventories for them all, except STB, HPA and POP and I think this
is because we never received this information on conversion.

Is it possible to send us everything you have for these 3 schools please?
Even if it's not up to date - a starting point for the schools to update
themselves would be good.

Desktop, for example).*

For example, if you were sent or have ""Patch 22573.zip"", please extract
this to produce three more files. This includes:

3.61.870 to 3.62.999 22573 Patch.XML
3.61.870 to 3.62.999 22573 Patch.ZIP
3.61.870 to 3.62.999 22573 Patch.ZIP.signature

*Please do not extract the contents of the second .zip file within the
initial .zip file that you were sent.*

2. Run dbUpgrade. This is located in either:

Start > All Programs > SIMS Applications > dbUpgrade
*or:*
C:\Program Files\SIMS\SIMS .net\DBupgrade.exe (*on workstation*)
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\Binn\DBupgrade.exe (*on
SIMS SQL server*)

3. Select '*Run the following SIMS database upgrade file*' and specify the
path to the location of where the patch file (.zip) is.

Using the earlier example, you would point this where the 3.61.870 to
3.62.999 22573 Patch.ZIP file is.

4. Enter the SIMS connection and login details:

- For the '*Server Name*' field, please enter the SIMS Server name and the
SQL Instance the database is hosted on, e.g. *MyServer\SIMS20XX*.
- Enter the name of your SIMS .net database into the '*Database Name*'
field.
- And then login with a SIMS username and password or you can use the SQL
SA user account.


If you are unsure of your server or database name details you can find
these via the menu route Tools | System Information within SIMS for SIMS,
or via the FMSConnect.ini located in C:\Program Files\SIMS\FMSSQL (or
C:\Program Files (x86)\SIMS\FMSSQL depending on your setup) for FMS.

Click '*Login*' once these details have been entered.

*Important Note:** If advised to run the patch as the SA user please
specify SA as the SIMS Username and enter your SA password.*

5. The patch should now show in the list, which then if you click install,
this will apply the patch against the specified database.

Depending on what is being applied, this can take some time to complete and
the dbUpgrade window may become unresponsive during this time. It would be
strongly recommended that this window is left open until it has finished.

*Important Note: It would be advised to apply patches or upgrades at a time
when no SIMS users are logged in.*

I hope this helps.

the helpdesk on their mobiles as it has been quoted as being against MAT
policy. I'm not sure where this has come from, would you be able to share
with me the policy that is being referred to?

Many thanks

Smoothwall issue appears to be fixed!  Thanks so much.

The terms and conditions pop-up issue is still there though - the text in
red is a hyperlink to open the statistics and marketing permission pop-up
but its blocked so i can't play the clips that play on the page.

If vital could help me solve that it would be amazing!

Thanks

,T20240509.0236,Michaela's laptop,"Hi

I spoke to Rob and Jonny about issues Michaela keeps having with her laptop
and internet connectivity.

Jonny came to site on Monday and ran some updates.

Michaela's laptop is still really not performing well, dropping connection
to the internet frequently and some websites are very slow.  For example we
are trying to authorise pay claims on iTrent and it keeps kicking her out
because it's too slow to respond. Online meetings are also problematic with
frequent drop-outs.

Michaela has experienced several issues with this laptop since receiving it
(it is one of the newer models).

I do feel we need to have someone back on site to look at it again please.

Thanks
Laura

---------- Forwarded message ---------
From: MHR <priority@mhrglobal.com>
Date: Wed, 8 May 2024 at 14:45
Subject: Important Change Reminder
To: <d.hewitson@ebor.academy>

<https://content.mhrglobal.com/NTM0LVRIWC02NzUAAAGS92xlqxiIE4xIlKQQ5JgNUh32iYEF6exYnQBTSJ4HxoLwnci0lp4kQr9yeI3bdSlEBa8N99Y=>





Important Change Reminder

Dear Customer


We wanted to make you aware of an error in the email circulated at 10:00 this
morning.



The IP address listed was incorrect and must be ignored.



The correct IP addresses to use for all MHR's hosted systems, excluding
SFTP, are *162.159.140.181* and *172.66.0.179.*



We would like to sincerely apologise for this inconvenience.


Please see the corrected information in full below.




During the month of June 2024, we will be introducing Cloudflare™ which
will route inbound connections to our hosted systems and therefore
enhancing the security and availability of our hosted systems.



The following information will help to prepare for this change.



*What we need you to do*



Please ensure that your IT department are made aware of this upcoming
change as soon as possible. Following this change, your hosted services
will be presented using new IP addresses; we recommend checks are completed
in advance to ensure:

   -  Any firewall or web proxy policies related to MHR hosted services are
   configured to use fully qualified domain names *(e.g.
   environment.webitrent.com <http://environment.webitrent.com>)* instead
   of IP addresses.
   - If IP addresses must be used in the above policies, both the current
   and new IP addresses for your hosted services should be included. You can
   request confirmation of your existing IP addresses through a support case,
   as detailed at the end of this email. The new IP addresses for all MHR’s
   hosted systems, excluding SFTP, will be *162.159.140.181* and
   *172.66.0.179.*
   - Ensure that MHR’s public DNS is not overridden within your own
   internal DNS configuration. The DNS zones used by our hosted systems are
   webitrent.com, webitrent.ie, and mhranalytics.com.



*How will it affect your service?*



The above change will be rolled out in a phased manner outside of working
hours  throughout June 2024. The services included are:

   -  Live and Non-Live iTrent Environments
   - iTrent Interfaces
   - Business Objects Environments
   - iTrent Document Manager Environments
   - Enable Now Environments
   - TM1 Environments
   - MCR Environments



MHR will communicate specific maintenance dates, from which your hosted
services will be proxied through Cloudflare™, later this month.



If your iTrent system is hosted using a customised URL, MHR will
communicate additional change information in the next few weeks.



The SFTP service is not included as part of the initial migration to
Cloudflare™. MHR will communicate details on the SFTP migration to
Cloudflare™ when a migration date has been confirmed.



If you have any queries in relation to the above or require confirmation of
the current IP addresses for your hosted services, please raise a case via
the MHR Service Desk entitled “CS-CF-032024”.



If you have any questions, please contact your Account Manager.



Kind regards,



MHR Team

I have become aware of some tickets that are still outstanding and
would appreciate it if you could send me the details of anything that is
showing as outstanding for our school.  Alternatively if you are able to
give me access to the dashboard that we had a demo of back in February then
I can check this information myself.

The tickets that I am aware of are:

T20240429.0192 - issue with Nursery Ipads (cannot access Tapestry app)
T20240426.0158 - issue with Reception Ipads (cannot access Tapestry app)
T20240429.0364 - issue with Smart board, this was first reported on 30th
April, then chased on 2nd & 8th May

These three issues are all affecting teaching and learning in the early
years classes.  It would be helpful if someone could attend as the school
day ends at 3.15 so that the teachers can be available to fully explain
their issues.

Many thanks

,T20240508.0286,Issues printing,"Hi,

A ticket was raised for problems printing from the Rec classroom to the
Toshiba printer on the Leyes site.
As far as I know this has been looked into however I'm still
having the same issue.
Documents that I send to print aren't coming out of the printer.
I've sent a couple of documents today that haven't come out.
I'm not sure if its an issue with PDFs as the documents that failed to come
out were PDF or whether it's a general printing issue however it's
impacting on teaching etc.
TAs can't plant phonics plans for their sessions etc.

Thanks

I am having an issue with a website that we use in year 2 to create music.
It's called Chrome Music Lab. We can go onto the website and all the items
on there work, except the one called Song Maker. When the children click on
it (on the chrome books) it comes up with an error message and says
'website blocked.'

Prior to the change of internet usage this website worked with no problems.

If this could be looked into that would be great as we use this website as
part of our computing curriculum.

Thank you, Jessica

A couple of issues:
We still have the problem of our supply user login not being able to access
the bbc websites or youtube. A lot of staff use this login for shared space
computers because of GDPR and it having no access to the drive.

We need this username to be able to access these websites also so supply
teachers can use lesson prep properly.

Second, my name is not correct on my user login. The login screen and
others show me as Ms and my name is Miss. Can this be fixed?

Thanks
Helen

,T20240508.0167,Gmail screen problems,"Hi Tom,
I don't know if you can help with this but I keep getting a big black bar
appearing across the bottom (and occasionally the top) of my screen when I
have my Gmail open. It is very frustrating as it blocks out the bottom of
emails including where the 'send' button is.
I find if I restart the computer this fixes it temporarily but it
inevitably comes back eventually. This only affects my screen when Gmail is
open, and so far has only happened to my Harland.h@sfx account and not my
enquiries@sfx account.
Have you any idea what might be causing this?

was never matched and as they are marked for deletion/suspension i cannot
match their email. I assume you do this via the Google Admin website rather

Hello Babs,

I will connect to your InVentry system shortly to assist with ticket 608697.

During this process, we will attempt to blank the screen out, as this may
contain personal information. However, we would appreciate if you could
take some precautions in case the connection drops, exposing the screen's
display. This can be done by turning screen around or covering the display.

We will contact you when we have finished on your system with an update.

Kind regards,

Hi Babs,

Just following up on my previous email.

It seemed like we were having issues connecting onto the unit to
troubleshoot this issue for you.

Could you ask your IT to unblock teamviewer on the touchscreen to make sure
we can create a connection fine, and to make sure the unit has a proper
internet connection? Once this is done we can remotely connect to
troubleshoot this issue for you.

Thanks,

Is it possible to allow me permission to connect to my one drive and share

but I cannot connect to one drive or sharepoint.  I can connect to them in
Power Apps, but I cannot open either to get any documents in them or have
apps available to me in office 365 login.

I have been given permission to access the HSLT sharepoint, but I do not
want to save that at the moment as the live Power Bi is in there and I am
training on the Power Apps and I am concerned with causing issues.  Below
is what I see when trying to save an excel file.  When I go to browse I can
see a yellow folder named one drive, but the file does not appear anywhere
in the apps to be able to use.

Important information





<https://content.mhrglobal.com/NTM0LVRIWC02NzUAAAGS9meXyhuxzQif0CUldkDfKkKOCblqoxWJc7OZDgzt33jo5_Z8rYs1g79MGZeviQxyCIyrNaw=>





Important Change Reminder

During the month of June 2024, we will be introducing Cloudflare™ which
will route inbound connections to our hosted systems and therefore
enhancing the security and availability of our hosted systems.



The following information will help to prepare for this change.



*What we need you to do*



Please ensure that your IT department are made aware of this upcoming
change as soon as possible. Following this change, your hosted services
will be presented using new IP addresses; we recommend checks are completed
in advance to ensure:

   -  Any firewall or web proxy policies related to MHR hosted services are
   configured to use fully qualified domain names *(e.g.
   environment.webitrent.com <http://environment.webitrent.com>)* instead
   of IP addresses.
   - If IP addresses must be used in the above policies, both the current
   and new IP addresses for your hosted services should be included. You can
   request confirmation of your existing IP addresses through a support case,
   as detailed at the end of this email. The new IP addresses for all MHR’s
   hosted systems, excluding SFTP, will be 159.140.181 and 172.66.0.179.
   - Ensure that MHR’s public DNS is not overridden within your own
   internal DNS configuration. The DNS zones used by our hosted systems are
   webitrent.com, webitrent.ie, and mhranalytics.com.



*How will it affect your service?*



The above change will be rolled out in a phased manner outside of working
hours  throughout June 2024. The services included are:

   -  Live and Non-Live iTrent Environments
   - iTrent Interfaces
   - Business Objects Environments
   - iTrent Document Manager Environments
   - Enable Now Environments
   - TM1 Environments
   - MCR Environments



MHR will communicate specific maintenance dates, from which your hosted
services will be proxied through Cloudflare™, later this month.



If your iTrent system is hosted using a customised URL, MHR will
communicate additional change information in the next few weeks.



The SFTP service is not included as part of the initial migration to
Cloudflare™. MHR will communicate details on the SFTP migration to
Cloudflare™ when a migration date has been confirmed.



If you have any queries in relation to the above or require confirmation of
the current IP addresses for your hosted services, please raise a case via
the MHR Service Desk entitled “CS-CF-032024”.



If you have any questions, please contact your Account Manager.



Kind regards,



MHR Team

Every school is having this issue.



I’ve been told the best way to get on (and we were successful yesterday with Tim) is to log on using your phone (off the school network) and create a new password. When you then log in on the school network using that new password it will let you get straight in.



This apparently is the advice from Pearson.

For example, if you were sent or have ""Patch 22573.zip"", please extract
this to produce three more files. This includes:

3.61.870 to 3.62.999 22573 Patch.XML
3.61.870 to 3.62.999 22573 Patch.ZIP
3.61.870 to 3.62.999 22573 Patch.ZIP.signature

*Please do not extract the contents of the second .zip file within the
initial .zip file that you were sent.*

2. Run dbUpgrade. This is located in either:

Start > All Programs > SIMS Applications > dbUpgrade
*or:*
C:\Program Files\SIMS\SIMS .net\DBupgrade.exe (*on workstation*)
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\Binn\DBupgrade.exe (*on
SIMS SQL server*)

3. Select '*Run the following SIMS database upgrade file*' and specify the
path to the location of where the patch file (.zip) is.

Using the earlier example, you would point this where the 3.61.870 to
3.62.999 22573 Patch.ZIP file is.

4. Enter the SIMS connection and login details:

- For the '*Server Name*' field, please enter the SIMS Server name and the
SQL Instance the database is hosted on, e.g. *MyServer\SIMS20XX*.
- Enter the name of your SIMS .net database into the '*Database Name*'
field.
- And then login with a SIMS username and password or you can use the SQL
SA user account.


If you are unsure of your server or database name details you can find
these via the menu route Tools | System Information within SIMS for SIMS,
or via the FMSConnect.ini located in C:\Program Files\SIMS\FMSSQL (or
C:\Program Files (x86)\SIMS\FMSSQL depending on your setup) for FMS.

Click '*Login*' once these details have been entered.

*Important Note:** If advised to run the patch as the SA user please
specify SA as the SIMS Username and enter your SA password.*

5. The patch should now show in the list, which then if you click install,
this will apply the patch against the specified database.

Depending on what is being applied, this can take some time to complete and
the dbUpgrade window may become unresponsive during this time. It would be
strongly recommended that this window is left open until it has finished.

*Important Note: It would be advised to apply patches or upgrades at a time
when no SIMS users are logged in.*

I hope this helps.

I have just had a meeting with Clifton Moor Pre-School who are an onsite
private provider. They are having issues with their internet and their
emails which are being blocked. Jackie has said she has raised a ticket but
believes that their set up is complicating matters. I believe  Matthaus has
been in and looked and is due to come back in. They are using Crystal
Hosting and Thunderbird. I have suggested is it worth setting up a new
gmail or outlook account and have emails from the previous account
forwarded through, do you think this is an option?

What else can we do to ensure that they are not blocked

,T20240507.0109,Internet affecting Door / gate access,"Good morning

On the first day back every week (usually Monday but Tuesday this week) our
gates have to be reinstated.  They show online on the paxton system but
between them opening at 6.15am and when they should close at 8.25am (car
park gate) and 8.40am (pedestrian Gate) they lose internet signal.

Today, for the first time, this also affected one of the doors in
school which would not release when fobbed.  Once reinstated the gates &
the door both started to work.

As this happens every week there seems to be an issue with the connection
first thing on a Monday morning.

Please could this be looked into.

Thanks

Morning all.



We have made multiple site visits over the last few days while looking into
this remotely. The Technical team have been leading on this, as described
earlier the issue has been complex.  We believe we have found the cause and
the issue is now resolved. Legacy firewall rules on the Smoothwall were
casing a block on devices downloading a particular Certificate Authority –
something we have not seen before.



Georgina, please can I ask for your feedback? He devices we tested onsite
so far worked straight away.



Apologies that it has taken more time than we would typically expect to
resolve an issue of this nature.



Thank you

escalated this to Dan Wingfield within the Vital team to investigate
further.

Hi everyone,



I'm really sorry to chase, but we are still having a lot of problems with
the RWI portal after trying to resolve this with the school improvement
team and vital on several occasions.



Please see the email below from my reading lead who outlines the problems
we continue to face and the impact this is having.



We would really appreciate this being sorted as soon as possible so our
staff and children can maximise what RWI offers.



Many thanks

Hi Hannah,



We are still not able to access the RWI portal on our teacher accounts. All
of my reading teachers when logging on receive the screenshot at the bottom
of this email.



Getting onto the portal has been inconsistent since half term. I have
emailed vital on numerous occasions but unfortunately this has not been
resolved. We had somebody come out from vital a few weeks ago but typically
on that day, the portal was working. It has not since that day. I have been
shown how to use Ublock when accessing the website but this does not work
when I refresh (it has worked for kapow thankfully).



Just to clarify, when I speak to vital, they are extremely helpful. It is
just frustrating from a reading leader perspective that this website is not
consistently available to access, especially when it is such a brilliant
resource to use for visuals for our children.



I am extremely worried now as I am not able to deliver the following at FOG:



-Afternoon speed sound sessions with the help from the portal if needed

- Access the new Ellie and Fred games f

I tried to use Tidal with Serato earlier today and it said the streaming

it seems like a more common problem with v3 of serato. But i wonder if with
it being streaming it might be blocked somewhere...

,T20240503.0141,Unable to access anything on laptop,"Dear Vital

Today i have been supporting our GRA school and unfortunately i am unable
to access anything at all using my laptop.
Upon arrival at GRA this morning i tried to log in, alas i had to restart
the laptop 3 times before i could see anything.
Since then i can see the google search engine page BUT i cannot access the
Google Drives, cannot access emails, cannot log into any mathematical
online software and web pages.

This has been most problematic today as i was supporting a yr10 class pd1,
teaching a yr8 class pd2 and supporting 2 yr11 lessons pd3. I have had to
ask colleagues to print out materials for these and other yr11 classes i
will be supporting this afternoon.

I also am currently in the process of reviewing and rewriting a new maths
curriculum for next year and instead of doing that today i have had to
forward this email as yet again i cannot access material i need to do this
crucial job.

My 1 main fear now is that the laptop will not function correctly over the
bank holiday weekend and again some valuable curriculum design time could
well be lost again.

I send this email from a PC within the maths dept. at GRA which means it is
not my profile at fault as i can access all i need from this machine but
the laptop is not operational.

Any urgent advice would be most welcome.

Kind regards

Hi Babs,

Thank you for your time on the phone.

As discussed, it seems like we are having issues connecting onto the unit
to troubleshoot this issue at the moment.

Could you ask your IT to unblock teamviewer on the touchscreen to make sure
we can create a connection fine, and to make sure the unit has a proper
internet connection? Once this is done we can remotely connect to
troubleshoot this issue for you.

Thanks,

Hi Babs,

It appears I am having issues connecting on.

Could you go through the following steps and let me know what the
teamviewer details are?


   1. *On the sign in screen, triple click on the InVentry Logo on your
   home screen - this is usually in the bottom left of the screen*
   2. *When the keypad appears enter the first 4 digits of your Anywhere ID
   (Your ID is 1588) *
   3. *From the options that appear please select 'Shutdown InVentry', you
   will then see a normal PC desktop*
   4. *An orange box will appear in the bottom right corner, please tap
   this then press 'Ok' in the window that appears in the centre of the screen
   (if you miss this the sign in screen will reload and you will need to
   complete the first 3 steps again)*
   5. *If you can then double tap the TeamViewer icon  on the desktop*
   6. *This should then open the TeamViewer application and provide you
   with an ID and a password. If you can please send these to us and leave the
   TeamViewer software open.*
   7. *To reload the sign in software double tap the 'InVentry Core' icon
   on the desktop*

We have made multiple site visits over the last few days while looking into this remotely. The Technical team have been leading on this, as described earlier the issue has been complex.  We believe we have found the cause and the issue is now resolved. Legacy firewall rules on the Smoothwall were casing a block on devices downloading a particular Certificate Authority – something we have not seen before.

Georgina, please can I ask for your feedback? He devices we tested onsite so far worked straight away.

Apologies that it has taken more time than we would typically expect to resolve an issue of this nature.

Hi everyone,

I'm really sorry to chase, but we are still having a lot of problems with the RWI portal after trying to resolve this with the school improvement team and vital on several occasions.

Please see the email below from my reading lead who outlines the problems we continue to face and the impact this is having.

We would really appreciate this being sorted as soon as possible so our staff and children can maximise what RWI offers.

Many thanks

Hi Hannah,

We are still not able to access the RWI portal on our teacher accounts. All of my reading teachers when logging on receive the screenshot at the bottom of this email.

Getting onto the portal has been inconsistent since half term. I have emailed vital on numerous occasions but unfortunately this has not been resolved. We had somebody come out from vital a few weeks ago but typically on that day, the portal was working. It has not since that day. I have been shown how to use Ublock when accessing the website but this does not work when I refresh (it has worked for kapow thankfully).

Just to clarify, when I speak to vital, they are extremely helpful. It is just frustrating from a reading leader perspective that this website is not consistently available to access, especially when it is such a brilliant resource to use for visuals for our children.

I am extremely worried now as I am not able to deliver the following at FOG:

-Afternoon speed sound sessions with the help from the portal if needed
- Access the new Ellie and Fred games for set 2 sounds
- Deliver RWI practise times using the portal
- Allow my reading teachers extra CPD time (ED) so they can confidently take over other groups
- Get my resources ready for the next reading leader training
- Carry out my next set of RWI assessments in a few weeks

Any help to solve this ASAP would be appreciated.

Thank you for any help/ guidance in advance,

Georgina

At Scarcroft Primary School, we wish to encourage staff to have a healthy
work-life balance, and therefore we discourage the sending of emails
outside of the traditional working day. Where emails are received after
6pm, over the weekend or during a holiday period, it is likely that a
response will be given during the school’s normal working hours. Thank you
in advance for your understanding in helping us to promote a happy, healthy
and productive workforce.

Hi Helen,

I've just tried to access a bbc website to do a touch typing game we
accessed last week with a child in our class. The website says it is
blocked, and when i tried to submit the website on the smoothwall link
above, it says that they are not accepting any more requests.

This is the website;

Morning Craig,

Don't know whether to raise this on a ticket.

Seems we are having issues with SIMS in terms of third party reports etc.

We had that one from the council yesterday about Synergy and I have had two separate ones from Wonde saying that reports are failing. I have also just been on EduLink and it can't sync as the SIMS agent is disconnected.

Dear all,

I am delighted to let you know Herts Music Service are running two UniSONG days this term on the 20th and 21st of June. UniSONG is a day of singing with Rufus Frowde, a fantastic choral Animateur. The day is an opportunity for children to develop their vocal technique, to sing in parts, and sing with a live band.
This will also give your children the opportunity to perform in an ensemble, musically and creatively, and to expand their musical horizons.

It’s also an opportunity for staff to gain repertoire knowledge and learn about the importance of vocal health. The day will give them some great ideas for teaching singing within your own setting too. Rufus is an excellent vocal leader who has worked with the BBC Singers and the National Youth Choir of Great Britain. He was the Artistic and Musical Director of the 2014, 2016, & 2018 Hertfordshire Galas at the Royal Albert Hall and we are delighted to have him back with us for UniSONG 2024.

We are offering schools the opportunity to bring one year group from upper KS2/Y5 or Y6, but spaces are limited. Places will be allocated on a first come first served basis.

The event is held at St John’s Church, Boxmoor, from 9.30am (arrival anytime from 9.00am so we are ready to start singing at 9.30am) until 3.00pm, with a concert at 2.45pm for parents. Children will need to bring a packed lunch, snack and drink.

Unfortunately, we do not have funding for the day, so there will be a charge of £150 per class for the day.
To sign up, please reply to this email with your school and number of classes you would like to bring.

Please do let me know if you have any questions.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Best wishes,
Tansy Agnew

Herts Music Service is open 7 days a week 8.00am-9.00pm so you may receive e-mails from me in the evenings and at weekends.  Please only respond at a time convenient to you and in your working time.

At Scarcroft Primary School, we wish to encourage staff to have a healthy
work-life balance, and therefore we discourage the sending of emails
outside of the traditional working day. Where emails are received after
6pm, over the weekend or during a holiday period, it is likely that a
response will be given during the school’s normal working hours. Thank you
in advance for your understanding in helping us to promote a happy, healthy
and productive workforce.

Hi Craig



Thank you.



This is in relation to Orchestra Lite installs, which we have from
information provided as recorded on the server below:



SIMS Command Reporter Directory
(SIMS Installation Location)

SIMS SQL Server Name + Instance Name
(E.g. GL11234\SQL2016)

C:\Program Files (x86)\Capita\SIMS\SIMS.net

10.255.255.8\,51002



I believe the IP address is: *89.255.158.3 *but it will probably connect to
the Synergy URLS, the connection seems fine from our report just time out:



Live: https://hull.cloud.servelec-synergy.com/synergy/live/SynergyWeb/

Test: https://hull-test.cloud.servelec-synergy.com/Synergy/Dev/SynergyWeb/

Ill await your update, thanks.

Good morning



Please forward to the most appropriate person, this needs resolving as soon
as possible.



We currently have a report schedule to import your SIMS data every Friday
at 8pm but the last report has failed.



This is due to deadlock or timeout in which another service or report is
possibly running at the same time, please can you advise on a more
appropriate time for the report to be run?



Or advise internal services that the report will be run and not to time any
additional services with this?



Kind regards

to me, Cobus

Good morning,



I hope this email finds you well.



As we are fast approaching a bank holiday Monday, I am writing to ask if your opening hours are changing? And, if you would like any changes on your schedule?



We can change the schedule to be the same as it would be on a normal ‘closed’ day, if this is what you would require?



I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Helen,

I'm just wondering whether Thesaurus.com should be accessed by our children
on their chromebooks.

A member of my class was looking for a synonym for 'fried' (as in
brain-fried) and these synonyms popped up. This isn't the first time
inappropriate words have popped from this website! What do you think? I
just thought I should make you aware!

,T20240502.0084,IMPORTANT: LBQ Access & Hutchisons Tickets,"Good morning,

Further to my telephone conversation with Marcus, I am following this up
with an email.

As discussed, please can the ticket raised by Vicky Danbury earlier in the
week for access to LBQ be actioned.  The Year 6 children use this website
as part of their SATs revision so it's important that access is reinstated
as soon as possible.

In addition to this, I raised a ticket on Monday then I have been chasing
this up daily to request that Hutchisons be re-added to the hidden
network.  The school uses the Appetite system and since the switch-over,
the children have been unable to use the touchscreen to select their
meals.  This in turn is creating delays with the lunchtime service with
some children not leaving the dining hall until 1.15 p.m.

Whilst I fully appreciate and understand the challenges the Trust are
facing since the switch-over we would really appreciate it if the above
requests could be dealt with as a matter of priority.

Many thanks
Clare

So my problem is that i need to play the 'attention grabber' clip - but the
website demands i accept some terms and conditions prior to this.  When i
click on the link to open these, the link is blocked as a pop-up.  Also
smoothwall is preventing all videos from opening within the website.

Ideally i'll need this clip to play for y5 today at 11 if vital can work
their magic?

Thanks so much

,T20240502.0047,Fwd: Wifi - YHS Guest hotspot,"Hi,

Several staff say they are unable to connect to ""YHS Hotspot""; for some,
this has been the case forever e.g. it doesn't work for me with my
Fairphone 5 and it didn't work with my Fairphone 3. But other users were
able to connect to it, however are no longer able to do so since the
internet changeover. It's unclear if that's related or not, and is
difficult for Kyle and I to test as it has never worked for us.

Russ mentioned to Ian something about a ""BYOD"" VLAN, does that refer to the
existing ""YHS Hotspot"" or something else?

If someone could give Kyle a call back at some point that would be great; I
am going to be away today from approx 11:00. His direct number is
01904806581 and I've copied him into this email.

Many thanks,

Just to say the guest hotspot keeps dropping out on the iPad's for

Is there anyway we can get reconnected to the YHS hotspot

even internally, so I think there is an issue with that server itself

Furthermore, neither server works externally, due to the gateway error,
which will be due to the internet switchover.

I usually access my work email account on my phone as one of the email

though it hadn’t been changed). When I did it gave an error message (I
think error code 400) saying access was denied. I tried again and went
through settings. I have tried deleting the account and re-adding it (which
it now won’t let me do). I am able to access the account through the Google

Morning Dave

On 3rd - 5th June Nathan Thompson will be running study skills sessions for
Year 10 in 2 hour slots. We went through the plan with John in Operations
but I thought it might be helpful to have it emailed too.

We will be using the well of the hall periods 1, 2, 3 and 4 Monday and
Tuesday and periods 1 and 2 on Wednesday.

Please can we have 11 of the bigger tables with 4 chairs along one side,
facing the stage, and one at each end. As we don't use the well for lunch
or break it can stay like that hopefully to make less work for your team. I
suggest that any lettings in there are cancelled.

Nathan will need a flipchart and stand, do you know where we can get one
from?

Many thanks

Katie

The teachers I-Pad in Farah class not connecting to the internet.
Tried rebooting.
I suggested to disconnect from the wi-fi and reconnect. Now it is asking
for a wi-fi password that she doesn't know. Tried the password I have in
the office, but she said that didn't work either.

I-Pad now sitting in the school office. Can you help?
I will be back in the school office at 08.10 tomorrow morning

As per our conversation, please find screenshots below including URLs of 2
websites I no longer have access to since the network swapped, I work in
the school office so I update these and pull information frequently.

Could you also look into why I no longer have access to life360 on my
mobile? I use this to safeguard my own children, I have to use school's
internet as there is no signal on the estate and my personal mobile has the
inventry software installed for evacuations, this is also playing up since
the switch, with an error message of ""you are outside the configured
geofence for Staynor Hall"".

Dear Vanessa Keel,

Please provide the following article to your IT team, should they need
assistance please ask them to provide direct dials.



This should however be all they need. Take care


How to install SIMS products on a new workstation via SOLUS 3
KB0052384
Introduction

The following article will take you through the process of installing SIMS
on a new workstation using SOLUS 3.

This article assumes that SOLUS 3 has already been installed and configured
on the server.

The steps to install SIMS can also be applied to installing FMS and
Discover.

If a SOLUS 3 agent has already been installed on the workstation, but you
are having issues with the agent and wish to reinstall it, it is highly
recommended to instead follow the steps in the KB article below.

KB0044360 - SOLUS 3 - How to perform a clean uninstallation /
reinstallation of the SOLUS 3 Agent
<https://customer.support-ess.com/csm?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0044360>


If installing SIMS on the workstation for the first time, please continue
with the steps below to add the new workstation in to the SOLUS 3
environment.
Instructions

1) On the server, open *SOLUS 3 Deployment Server UI *using the shortcut on
the *Desktop*

2) Navigate to *Environment | Targets | Clients*

3) Click the *Add* button

4) Place a *tick* in to the products that you wish to have installed e.g.
*SIMS*, *SIMS Discover*, *FMS*

5) Click the *Choose Clients* button

6) Locate the new workstation on your *Network*. You can also locate the
workstation by browsing your domain's Active Directory by selecting
the *AD* radio
button. Alternatively, if you know the workstation's hostname or IP
address, this can be entered in to the field at the bottom and SOLUS 3 will
attempt to detect it.

7) Click the arrow to move the workstation over to the *SELECTED
COMPUTERS* section
and click *OK*

8) You will be prompted to enter the *Domain\Administrator* credentials.

9) Click *Save*

10) SOLUS 3 will now attempt to install an Agent on to the new workstation.
The status of this can be viewed within *Environment | Agents | Agents*



11) Once the installation of the Agent has finished, the selected product
will then automatically begin to download and install on to the desired
workstation.

12) Staff who are currently using the workstation will notice the following
popup from the SOLUS 3 Agent  in the Windows system tray.

13) Staff can hasten the deployment of SIMS by clicking the *Deploy Now* button
which will skip the 2 minute timer.



14) The desired product (be it SIMS, FMS or Discover) will then begin to
install on to the workstation.

15) When the deployment has finished, you will see the following message in
the *SOLUS 3 Agent Notifier* window and the user can now launch the
software via the Windows *START* menu and log in.

I have just had a call with Vital in regards to this issue. My
understanding is that Giles has visited the site this morning to
gather further information. This appears to be a complex issue and he
escalated this to Dan Wingfield within the Vital team to investigate
further.

I am in a meeting with Vital later today, so will gain an update.

There's a delay between my PC and the staff room printer again. Anything

,T20240501.0048,Blocked - again - URGENT,"Hello,

Going to be honest - this is getting ridiculous now. We are blocked from
YouTube again We are blocked from any research for Jack in terms of google.
This is now the 4th day running. It gets solved the day before and then
stops working again a day later. We just can't access the curriculum or do
anything useful and sit wasting so much time. If anyone has a better
solution please help.

We are also blocked from using google books and the research Jack is doing
for his subjects. I did get a message from Giles saying that books etc
should now be unblocked for students. But this is the message that comes up.

Please help solve this issue once and for all.

[image: image.png]

And another one....

I get the same message of being blocked on my google account. When trying
to get onto YouTube - I get this message instead of being blocked.

We can't access anything much beyond google classroom/sheets/docs etc.

*Subject:* EBORA - SSO Requirements



Hi all,



Thanks for your time earlier.  To confirm:



   - You wish to use your Azure AD for iTrent authentication using SAML2
   giving you SSO.
   - Not all employees who need access are setup in Azure.
      - 50% of the schools are done
      - TBC on timeline on the remaining schools
      - The SSO project may need to be pushed back accordingly @Nicola
      Martin <Nicola.Martin@mhrglobal.com>
         - Customer has suggested September
      - Currently your staff use iTrent Native to authenticate
   - Synchronization from / to iTrent and AD is not required. You will
   continue to create accounts manually.
   - Chatbot is not in use yet
   - Web Recruitment is not in use yet
   - On-Boarding is not in use yet
   - A short outage is required on the day of the consultancy
      - Please check your Engine status after the outage
   - Currently your Consultancy dates are with myself on
      - 6th of July 2023 *ONLY*
      - Due to the customer already being live and this change affecting
      the user experience a *second date is required*.
      - Therefore day 1 will be for non live and day 2 will be for Live at
      least a week after the first date.
      - @Nicola Martin <Nicola.Martin@mhrglobal.com> please see above re
      pushing the consultancy date back and then a second date being required.



You will need to create 3 Non-Gallery SAML SSO Apps in your Azure tenant
with the following settings:



iTrent Live

EntityID : https://ce0854li.webitrent.com/shibboleth

ACS: https://ce0854li.webitrent.com/Shibboleth.sso/SAML2/POST





iTrent Test

EntityID : https://ce0854te.webitrent.com/shibboleth

ACS: https://ce0854te.webitrent.com/Shibboleth.sso/SAML2/POST





iTrent Dev

EntityID : https://ce0854de.webitrent.com/shibboleth

ACS: https://ce0854de.webitrent.com/Shibboleth.sso/SAML2/POST



Please use the Persistent Name ID Format.  Unique Identifier should be Email



Please follow the guidance in the attached SAML Client Partner document.



We will need the metadata once this has been done.



Please also provide a spreadsheet with the following:



*Current iTrent username*

*Primary Email in Azure*











We will use this to bulk update the users.



Thanks

It is just on their logins - it is the same if they login to a different

,T20240430.0333,Business Exam 10th May,"Hi,

I have spoken with Martin Charlton today about the student's notes being
printed out as there is a large number of them, however he says that the
students will be massively disadvantaged as they have been taught to use
the electronic copy to use as a framework for their response to the task.
He says Fiona and himself are happy to stay behind on the Thursday evening
and check them all to ensure they are all correct, but  we would need to
have Vital presence either that evening or early on the Friday morning to
transfer these files from Martin's desktop to the correct exam account.

I am quite concerned that there is room for human error here with such a
large number.  Please can I have your thoughts.

Thanks,
Amy

Not sure why but I cannot connect to Whatsapp on my phone now that the
broadband has changed. I need it to communicate with the PE department
throughout the day. I have tried all wifi accounts (pathfinder, AHS
guest and guest wireless) but it doesn't work. I get all my messages for
the day once I get to the car park when I leave for the day or when I'm  in
the middle of the field!

   old ones if the new ones have not been sorted yet.



   - I will need to upload files to the exam board tomorrow afternoon.  The
   exam accounts are below.  As gGiles mentioned yesterday the documents are
   copied from the exam account and placed in a file on my desktop called

Hi everyone,

I'm really sorry to chase, but we are still having a lot of problems with the RWI portal after trying to resolve this with the school improvement team and vital on several occasions.

Please see the email below from my reading lead who outlines the problems we continue to face and the impact this is having.

We would really appreciate this being sorted as soon as possible so our staff and children can maximise what RWI offers.

Hi Hannah,

We are still not able to access the RWI portal on our teacher accounts. All of my reading teachers when logging on receive the screenshot at the bottom of this email.

Getting onto the portal has been inconsistent since half term. I have emailed vital on numerous occasions but unfortunately this has not been resolved. We had somebody come out from vital a few weeks ago but typically on that day, the portal was working. It has not since that day. I have been shown how to use Ublock when accessing the website but this does not work when I refresh (it has worked for kapow thankfully).

Just to clarify, when I speak to vital, they are extremely helpful. It is just frustrating from a reading leader perspective that this website is not consistently available to access, especially when it is such a brilliant resource to use for visuals for our children.

I am extremely worried now as I am not able to deliver the following at FOG:

-Afternoon speed sound sessions with the help from the portal if needed
- Access the new Ellie and Fred games for set 2 sounds
- Deliver RWI practise times using the portal
- Allow my reading teachers extra CPD time (ED) so they can confidently take over other groups
- Get my resources ready for the next reading leader training
- Carry out my next set of RWI assessments in a few weeks

Any help to solve this ASAP would be appreciated.

Subject: Problem with Patrick's Chromebook
To: admin.toc@ebor.academy <admin.toc@ebor.academy>


Hi Sue,

We have been experiencing problems with access to 'Spelling Shed' on
Patrick's personal Chromebook at home. I spoke to Nick Goodacre about it
yesterday and he asked that I email you with the details to see if 'Vital'
can help?

Basically Patrick can log in and use his Spelling Shed account at school
and also on Rory's book at home but he cannot access the account on his own
book. Rory can also not access his account on Patrick's Chromebook.

Each time we try to log on an error message appears ( attached photo of
error page). The activity page then appears with Patrick (or Rory's)
profile and games visible but the screen is pale and a rotating circle
appears in the centre of the screen, as though trying to log on, but it
never fully connects and allows access.

Not sure if problem with our Chromebook directly or with the account and no
idea how to solve, especially as don't have access as you guys are the
account managers.


If 'Vital' are able to help that would be great. If you need more details
or access to the book let me know.

Many thanks

Natalie

Thank you so much for going through the chromebook audit today.

This morning, there were 13 chromebooks in the SEN trolley (intervention
room). I know two students pick their chromebooks up on a Monday and return
them on a Friday. So we have 15 chromebooks in total.

We are absolutely desperate to find the rest, as we haven't got enough
chromebooks for the students who are entitled to have them.

Thank you,
Eva

Good Morning



I have been notified by our monitoring company that the Broadband path for
monitoring your intruder alarm went into fault on 26/04/2024 at 12:19:06
and has not yet restored.

The system is currently monitored via the secondary GPRS radio path but,
should this also go into fault, the system would not be able to be
monitored.

Please could you check your broadband connection and let me know if you
require an engineer to attend site to investigate.



Kind Regards,

Christine

Hi Clare,

I just popped you a quick call, but the receptionist advised you were in a
meeting.

The Appetite terminal which is installed at Staynor Hall school, is
currently showing 'Connection is not private.'

This message is usually due to security blocking the terminal seeing the
URL it needs to (app.hutchisoncatering.co.uk).

My colleague @Martin Smith <martin.smith@schoolgrid.co.uk> will call Zoe
(07460333440) tomorrow morning, just to see if there is anything we can do
over the phone.

However, usually with this message, the school I.T provider needs to advise
if a security certificate or a proxy is needed on the terminal.

We can then advise how to install these on the unit.

Kind Regards,
Sam

when I go to collect the printing it just hasn't come out.
Occasionally things do come out but on a significant delay, they seem to be

When I tried to log in this morning, after a forced Vital update reboot,
the Authenticator app came up and I passed the test with a number, but this
message appeared.  Is this acting as you would expect?  I can obviously
still access my email (to send this) so I don't know exactly which part
isn't working.

Can I leave it with you, please?

,T20240429.0361,website issue,"Hi,

Wonder if you can advise. We have had the existing website developers transfer the website to us. Basically, they have been charging us for nothing, as all the site updates are done by us. They used siteground, and our new version of the site is also on siteground. The site itself, with a temporary URL, works fine, but I am struggling to get the domain name (currently hosted by IONOS) to point to the new site. As this is something I have not had much to do with in the past, need a pointer in the right direction. Nameservers are the same of course (as both websites are on siteground), so emails continue to work OK. I need to know what to do to point the website terringtonhall.com to the new location. C names/a names, etc, I don't know if I need to edit these.

With my best wishes,

Stuart

,T20240429.0291,Summer exams laptop & PC logins,"Hello

We have previously asked James to set up logins for a set of laptops using Exam write (with folders for exported work) and for PCs in J21 for reading software, see list below that James provided.

We are now getting ready for the Summer exam season starting on Thur 9th May and will need 18 logins for Laptops & 15 logins to use on PC's in J21.

I would like the logins to run from Exam01 to Exam18 (with corresponding folders) for the Laptops.

I would like the J21 logins to run from Exam19 - Exam33.

Is it possible for you to set this up now?  We are currently using some of the laptops and folders for other exams happening in school so do not want the existing folders/ logins to be changed.

Thanks
Jo

Hi Clare,

I just popped you a quick call, but the receptionist advised you were in a
meeting.

The Appetite terminal which is installed at Staynor Hall school, is
currently showing 'Connection is not private.'

This message is usually due to security blocking the terminal seeing the
URL it needs to (app.hutchisoncatering.co.uk).

My colleague @Martin Smith <martin.smith@schoolgrid.co.uk> will call Zoe
(07460333440) tomorrow morning, just to see if there is anything we can do
over the phone.

However, usually with this message, the school I.T provider needs to advise
if a security certificate or a proxy is needed on the terminal.

We can then advise how to install these on the unit.

Kind Regards,
Sam

I've had a few complaints from lettings about the AHS-guest Wi-Fi network
not working since the broadband switch last week. I've made a new code to
test it myself and seems like it is working but the vast majority of
websites are now being blocked. Of those I've tested some like google and
Wikipedia are working but most sites (bbc news, facebook, youtube, the
independent) are returning various different error messages (website
blocked, could not establish a secure connection, this connection is not
private). Not urgent but would appreciate if you could have a look when you
have time!

Many thanks,

My deleted email folder seems to only go back 6 months now. It was at 2 years. Has something in the system been changed? It’s very handy to have over a years worth of emails as I tend to send a similar email every year at the same time and it’s efficient to largely copy and paste the previous one.

function has been disabled? I am trying to find an easy way for staff to

gone with chromecast on the screen which seems to be the easiest way.

May be worth checking all PCs and chrome books for any bbc content please?

Is there any way of checking what is now blocked for chrome books which

Yesterday the screen went all liney as students were trying to trace a

Hi Simon

Just tried to play the video and it isn't working now. It worked last night
which seems odd?

Jo has made me aware that we cannot print off a list of staff and visitors
in the event of an evacuation. I have also been told that this has been
raised before with a ticket and you have looked at the problem but we do
not have a resolution. As it stands in the event of an evacuation we would
not be able to confirm that the building is clear to the emergency service.
This is a real risk and it needs to be resolved today either by
fixing/replacing the printer or directing the report to the office or Jo
Bogue's printer. Please can you confirm by the end of today that we have a
solution.

,T20240426.0114,Account issues again,"Hi,

I'm in a lesson with Year 5 just now, and one of the children (Arthur Bristow) is not able to log into their OneDrive account. He has rebooted the PC and logged back in again twice but the problem persists. Windows is working, but his OneDrive is showing as empty. When I click on OneDrive, it invites me to set up OneDrive. I enter his email address (arbristow@terringtonhall.n-yorks.sch.uk), but it says that the email address doesn't exist.

Update - while I was typing the above, I got him to try a different laptop, and that's working for him, it logged into OneDrive automatically as you'd expect it to. The device that wouldn't work for him is 83H2HX3.

If you can suggest anything to stop this from happening so frequently I'd be very grateful.

we have a trolley of laptops that we use for animation and the younger
children.

We would like to use the 2animate software on Purple Mash but we can't seem
to find a way to access the usb webcams (the laptop camera is not good to
position).

There seems no way to switch in 2animate and we don't seem to be able to
access the setting on all of the laptops to turn off the laptop camera so
it defaults to the usb. Could someone please show us or allow access to the
settings on each laptop. We can do it on one but not the rest.

Also, Movie maker doesn't seem to load on any of them. Can this be
rectified?

This week we have noticed an increase in sites being blocked when trying to
use our devices.
When on my ipad with the class I can no long watch any videos including you
tube to share learning. Also when teaching using a chromebook which I HDMI
to a TV for a screen, I am unable to watch any learning songs on you tube
or access cbeebies etc learning sites.

In EYFS we have also found we cannot get onto cbeebies or the
learning games for children. For example if I type in 'maths games for
children' it comes up as blocked.

Our Nursery teacher has also shared that today her 'Little Wandle Rhyme
Time' videos on their website have come up saying blocked. These have to be
watched daily as part of the curriculum.

I understand it being blocked on children's accounts but when signed in on
a chromebook or computer on a teacher account can restrictions be lifted?
And also on class ipads?

Sorry for the long email!

Hi,

Our phone doesn't seem to be working in the Art store room. Is there a
chance to have a look? Just says the call failed.

I've tried different numbers and it also won't phone through to reception ,

Thanks

I used to be able to scan in Black and white as an option and save as a

Hi,

I have just been sorting/auditing the chromebooks here at St Lawrence's. We have 11 chromebooks that are flashing orange when charging but not switching on, is this a common error I could fix or do they need looking at? There is also one with no power or that will not switch on at all,

In addition, the two new laptops that we received; one of them which our music teacher takes home who works Thursdays says that she cannot access the server from her home, even with toggle proxy. Is theer anythings he needs tod do?

Thanks in advance

My laptop appears to be connected to the internet as I am getting emails at
times but it will not connect to cbeebies as it says it is banned due to
being a video game and it is just spooling now for a significant amount of
time when I try to watch film e.g. the very hungry caterpillar/ Mr Tumble
on youtube.

Ipads - the ipads 1837, 1835, 1833 I have in my room will not connect to
the internet at all - it has been turned on and off repeatedly. Trying
youtube, cbeebies iplayer, Tapestry etc

My teacher ipad - one of the recent issue ones 1956 - will not let me
access X/ twitter at school.

My classroom whiteboard will not connect to the internet at all and is
claiming privacy issues!

,T20240424.0272,Re: Ongoing IT issues in Music,"Hello All

I'll do my best to clarify the problems that exist with the M1 music
computers. All of the issues have been highlighted for some time (over two
years) right back to when Kevin was out IT tech in school. Unfortunately
the lack of a consistent tech has not helped, but Rachid is aware of them
and seeking solutions.

*PROBLEM 1*

There is a problem with some Macs connecting to the network on the far wall
in particular. Both Holly and now Rachid have highlighted the problem could
be with the old network switches they are connected to.

Solution: test and potentially upgrade the switches for L40 and test the
individual connections.

*PROBLEM 2*

Password reset. The Macs seem to request user password changes much more
often than other computers in school. On top of this there seems to be some
synchronization issues when changing.

Change the password reset settings potentially avoiding requests on the
macs and limit to PCs only?

*PROBLEM 3*

Websites blocked

Could we have a way of predicting when the permissions are to expire and
reset before lessons are disrupted.

*PROBLEM 4*

The hard drives of the macs are now filling restricting software upgrades
and general usage.

The solution to this could be much more complicated. The problem seems to
be caused by the way they have been configured to integrate into the
windows based system used by the rest of the school. The mac I use in the
studio has not got this problem so I suspect it is caused by data (system
data) as a consequence of having multiple users in their present
configuration. I would suggest looking at reconfiguring the macs and
creating a seperate network for the department. There would still need to
be internet for google classroom and drive but could be configured for
optimum mac use.



There have of course been school wide internet issues this week that have
added to the problems but hopefully these are now fixed.

Unfortunately I am not a network specialist and don't have access to the
software etc to solve these problems but happy to discuss and help Rachid
and Vital where I can

,T20240424.0075,Urgent - Huntington Trust-e SIMS extractor Schedule Task Still Not Working,"Marcus and I have looked at the issue as I had previously escalated a ticket about this problem. I thought it had been solved and that it was just an issue with a SIMS update that wasn't working correctly, but there are still problems after fixing the SIMS update loop.

New pupils are not being added to the cashless system, adjustments to free school meals are not being updated, and some payments made by parents are not added to students' accounts.  I've asked Civica at least four times now if they can take a look to see if they can see any reason why it is not working, and they either don't respond or take a look and say they can't see any issues or there must be a problem with the data from the MIS. The data is all correct on the MIS.

It's been ongoing for quite some time now, there is a scheduled task on the HS-Cashless01 server that is meant to run the Trust-e SIMS extractor sync automatically every weekday at 07:30, I don't know if there is a problem with this scheduled task and that this is where the problem lies.

Please can someone look into this issue as the school is getting increasingly frustrated that this has not been sorted and I'm at a loss for what else to do.",,Huntington School,Primary Address,,Complete,Low,Verbal,,,,Secondary School Escalation,Service Request,ATG MSP Support,ATG Windows Device,Other,,,,,,,,,VYL - Incidents,24/04/2024 09:31 AM,"Clarke, James",,08/05/2024 12:35 PM,15/05/2024 11:01 AM,08/05/2024 12:29 PM,"Clarke, James",,"Clarke, James",Not Visible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lack of Product Knowledge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,T20240423.0159,Internet Issues,"Good afternoon,

Following the internet update yesterday, I've been having lots of issues
with my iPad and laptop.

On my iPad, I can no longer access my emails or put evidence/access Seesaw.
I'm sure it's affected many other apps but Seesaw is particularly important
as I need to upload evidence of learning.

On my laptop I also can no longer access Youtube or any learning videos
which is a huge problem and affects so many lessons (history for showing
stock footage, maths for songs etc), movement breaks for learning etc.
Google Images has gone really strange where I can't show the children
images/examples as it automatically takes me to the website with the image
on as opposed to showing a bigger version next to the other images. These
websites are often not appropriate to show in the middle of a lesson. I'm
sure there are many more issues but these are the ones that are affecting
my children and my job performance the most at the moment.

If possible, please could it all just be reverted back to how it was as
this seems to have created so many more issues than it is worth and has
affected everyone in our school.

Many thanks,

Polly Gardonyi

,T20240423.0145,New starter Monday in year 9 - ML,"Hi everyone

Please note the following pupil will be joining us on Monday 29 April.
Can you please carry out requests as per below? Any queries, please let me
know.

SLT - for info

1. MATILDA LYNCH, year 9 - dob 03/10/2010.  Start date Monday 29 April.
Currently being home-schooled. Previously enrolled at SFX from September
2021 to February 2023 when decision taken to remove her from school for
home educating. So there may be dormant info on Arbor around Matilda which
would be helpful.

*Mitch *- please can you select a form for Matilda?
I have sent mum the options for GCSEs where there are places available,
awaiting confirmation of her choices.
Please can you contact Matilda's mum - Mrs George - to introduce yourself?
Tel 07756986522 / email heidi_george@hotmail.com.
It would also be helpful *if you could meet Matilda and her Mum at 1pm this
Friday 26 April* (Mum finishes work early on a Friday). Please let me know
if this is ok and I can confirm to Mum.  I'm sorry it is in your
lunchbreak, you are busy periods 4 and 5.  If that is not suitable, how
about 4pm for a pre-meet?
Please can you then meet Matilda at main reception at 8.45 on Monday to
take her to her new form?

*Tom *- please set her up with an account?

*Becky* - please can you add to Arbor? (I will send you more details). She
should be on the system as a previous student?  There will be no CTF as she
is home educated.

*Anna* - please can you set up on parent pay?  She may still have a dormant
account from being a previous student?

*Anna/Alison/Natasha -* Mum will be coming into school on Friday afternoon.
She says the girl's old uniform should still fit. If not, she will take a
look through the pre-loved uniform for Matilda whilst waiting for the
Trutex order.  She will also bring back the forms from the welcome pack,
can you put in my pigeon hole please?

*Ruth* - Matilda resides in Brompton, Northallerton, DL6 2QA so Mum may be
in touch regarding transport options.

Many thanks, Julia

Hi Jen,

Would you mind asking if Vital can add Arduino Science Journal<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.arduino.sciencejournal&hl=en_GB&gl=US> to all the Chroebooks? It's free and quite commonly used in schools. I just need to have a play and see what it actually allows us to do when used on a Chromebook.

Thanks,

Spencer

,T20240422.0180,Trouble opening zip files,"Hiya -

A few of the computers don't appear to have a program that will open zip
files (not sure if anyone else has encountered this yet) which is causing
some issues for classes who are downloading sample packs and wanting to use
them in GarageBand as part of the Remix project for Y9.

Is it possible for each one to be checked to see if they are capable of
doing this and a program installed on ones which aren't? Currently I think
it's number 7 and 10 and 11 which aren't able to open a zip file, but it
might be more than that.

Thanks

DO we have another laptop for Niki? The one she shares with Jo Bogue is now
on its last legs. She says the screen is now flickering/ being  fuzzy or
freezing. There are then lines across the screen and it switches off. This
is now affecting her planning and delivery of lessons.

She does need a laptop rather than a chrome book to work on the 2D

How can we solve this?

be possible to use this PC again please? Th software I use is called Serato

used but I think the drivers for my controller (plugged in through a USB -
MIDI cable) have. I have attached a link to the drivers
<https://www.numark.com/product/nvii> that are needed.
I can bring the decks in to test if you'd like as well. This is the
hardware that I use as well.

If possible (i'm happy to help if needed) can it be set up on the main
stage with an ethernet connection as I need access to the internet for my
tracks.

Should all be sorted now. Think it is a bit of trial and error with them getting all the different permissions sorted. Ron made a good point that really student reception should have access to override them at any point.

,T20240320.0078,Query regarding hardware issues,"Hello,

I'm currently working at Bishopthorpe Infant School and have a couple of queries about hardware here and the services you provide for us.


  1.
Do you service the classroom projectors? I have one that needs a new bulb (I think).
  2.
Do you service and maintain the large projector in the hall? It needs cleaning/filter changing as it keeps overheating. This will require long ladders.
  3.
My Dell laptop is not charging properly and I'm unsure if it is a fault with the computer itself or the cable as it only charges when the cable is in a specific position.
  4.
I wondered if you have any spare HDMI to VGA adaptors for us to use with the Dell laptops?
  5.
We have a Dell laptop that is currently unusable in classrooms because it does not connect to the sound system. I think it is a fault with the microphone port.

Many thanks for any help you can offer with these issues.

Giles/Rachid,
Yet another Google filter glitch.

Rachid,
Giles has looked into this for me, but has no idea why this has started
happening.
To outline, classes are filtered but students are not showing as per the
filter until refreshed by me, the sheet owner.
Poor Katy is the third person *just this week* to hit this issue.

I'm happy to go into the sheet and off again (I don't even have to do
anything but 'refresh'), but it shouldn't be doing it.
Any ideas? (screenshots below)

Katy,I've refreshed. Sorry for the inconvenience!

Just the one filter:

James has asked me to put this ticket back on.

We are requiring the staff Remote Desktop Server to be reinstated.

Staff require access to their desktop folders/shared drives such as the
pupil folders (this is for controlled assessment marking) etc./ certain
software for lesson planning:

1) Smartnotebook
2) ActiveInspire
3) MS Office
4) SIMS

That is all the current software I can think of at present, however, other
software maybe required in the future.

I know the trust are trying to push for staff to use chromebooks instead of
windows devices, however, certain departments like Maths, require specific
software that only runs on windows devices.

Having this on the remote desktop would help solve that issue.

Best wishes,
Lee

,T20240226.0105,Huntington Tills Sporadically Dropping Out,"I need some help investigating an issue with the tills in the dining hall at Huntington School.

The kitchen manager has told me that at least one of the tills (not always the same one) and sometimes multiple tills will lose connection to the server every day.

Most of the tills in the dining hall are connected wirelessly, there is one with a wired connection. I have made sure that the APs are up to date, a technician from Civica did a remote session recently and looked at the event viewer logs and concluded that there was an issue with the network in some way, but didn't give any more detail about what the issue was.

It's a sporadic but consistent issue, that never seems to affect all of the tills at the same time, a few will lose connection to the server, while the rest of the tills will remain connected.

Any help would be greatly appreciated in getting to the bottom of this, as when a till goes offline during service it can take up to 5 minutes to reconnect, and at peak times that slows service down dramatically.

,T20240207.0154,Email groups,"Hi Giles,

Just had it brought to my attention that the 'AHS - All Staff' email group,
for example, includes email addresses such as those now invalid, such as:

   - multiple emails ending @archbishopholgates.org
   <swise@archbishopholgates.org>
   - ainterview.1@ahs.pmat.academy
   - ainterview.5@ahs.pmat.academy
   - asupply.teacher@ahs.pmat.academy
   - cinterview.3@ahs.pmat.academy
   - PMAT staff (not AHS) such as   cjohnson@pmat.academy,
   cbriggs@pmat.academy
   - cmccart@pmat.academy

etc (too long a list to copy them all).

I'm worried that emails intended for current AHS Staff only, that may
include private student details, are being sent to those who should not
have access and were not expected to see the email content, and therefore
could be a data breach.

I haven't checked any other groups, but assume we will have a similar issue.

Could you chat with Sam Wilsden/Hannah Flavell to work out how to bottom
this, and how we can keep on top of this moving forward?

may need a VGA connector to get it to project too. AS I know as much about
computers as I do about  Quantum physics... I hope that makes sense to
you...

Many thanks

,T20240122.0150,Techsoft 2D Design upgrade request,"Good morning, I would like to look at upgrading the current 2D CAD software
that we use. We use this software throughout the school and have with some
success over the last year ensured that our students are competent and
gaining confidence with CAD.

We currently have Techsoft 2D design V2, I propose that we upgrade to
Techsoft 2D Design V3.

There are many advantages with the new version, one of which is the ability
to have this on Chromebooks.

Could you please look at the link below and advise the best package going
forward.

We would not have more that 60 students using this at any one time.

,T20230524.0094,Troubleshooting login issues,"Hi,

One of the exam boards, Pearson, have recently changed their login process
to incorporate MFA.  We are having issues with this internally, as the site
is taking too long to process the request and by time we receive the
passcode, the site has timed out.

I have accessed this externally and the passcode comes through immediately
so it appears the issue is being caused by something on the academy's
network.

Please can this be investigated as it's causing issues with us
accessing their website which is currently a problem with exams being on.

Please let me know if you require any other information.
