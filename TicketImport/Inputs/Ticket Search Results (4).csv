,T20230531.0061,RE: Action - ITT Updates,"Hi Susan,

To prevent Patricks ClassCharts access archiving each night.  I have changed the end date on his contract from 19/05/23 to 9/6/23.

I assume this will need replacing with 2 contracts one for the original dates to 19th May and a new one from 5th to 9th June, but this is not my area, so I didn't want to fiddle with this too much.

I have reactivated Patricks ClassCharts login and sent him an email to reset his password.

Hope that is ok.

Thanks,

Claire

Hi Rikki

It looks like your *SIMS* connection with Wonde isn’t working as expected.

update to the server and reboot again.

Good afternoon
Thank you for your email requesting data held in the name of  Izzak Bean.

 I am writing to confirm that we have received the request and I will pass it on to the school when they return from the half term break. 

The format of the data requested would include anything with Izzak's name on it over several years eg registers and class lists. These would not provide you with a great deal of information. It could amount to 1000s of documents which would need heavy redaction to remove all other 3rd parties details from the documents. It might be that access to Izzak's file would be of more benefit. I have suggested that the Headteacher calls you to discuss the request in more detail with you so that we can find out specifically what you need and get it to you quickly, certainly within the month timeframe allowed for Subject Access Requests ie the 26th June 2023. It might be that you can call into school to view the information required but I am sure that once we know what you are looking for we will be able to help in a focussed way.

Thank you and I hope you have a good half term.

,T20230526.0145,Child transfer,"Hi,

We have had a child transfer from Kirk Hammerton to Staveley School. Her name is Mia Hoatson. She seems to have 2 email addresses, one is 19miah and the other is 20miah. She is in Year 2, so I am assuming it should be the one starting with 20, but I don't actually know which one she is using. I also believe her password is redredred, but we have asked for that not to happen at Staveley as it doesn't model good e-safety practise.

Are you able to identify which login she is using and to change the password to Colouranimalnumber like the others at Staveley please?

Thanks,

,T20230526.0122,"Behind The Screens, May | We're making it easier than ever to manage your screens – 1 or 100! 🖥️","From Jonny Kirk <product-team@screencloud.io>: Get the most out of ScreenCloud – see what's new, discover pro tips and tricks, and book some face time with our Product team.

Hi Vital,

Welcome back to Behind the Screens!

Barely a week goes by without our customers commenting on how important it is for them to be able to manage large networks of screens with ScreenCloud, and just how valuable that capability is.

This month we are sharing a range of features specifically designed to make your life easier when managing screens.

Some of the features are brand new, such as Screenshot Capability for our ScreenCloudOS customers which allows you to remotely take a screen capture of exactly what the screen content looks like right now. We’ve also included a video and help guide on how to use Screen Status Notifications to let you know if a screen is disconnected for some reason.

As always we’d love to hear from you. If you have thoughts to share, or questions to ask please just reply to this email and we will be in touch.

All the best!

Latest releases  🆕

Stay informed with our new Screen Status Notifications feature and receive instant email alerts whenever your screens go offline or resume operation. With notifications sent directly to your inbox, you can stay in the know without having to manually check your screens, ensuring uptime and reliability to help you maintain the smooth operation of your digital signage network. Customize your notification preferences by defining who in your organization will receive the notification, and specifying a threshold value so you only receive alerts when screens are offline for a specific amount of time. See this feature in action by watching the video below.

Hello,

I can confirm your device is not currently communicating to us, please email me to schedule a time that is best to run a remote session to connect your machine, or if you would prefer, you can forward my request on to a member of your IT team.

The session should only last 5-10 minutes (per device connection), providing there are no complications. I will need the IP address of the copier to hand as I will need to browse to the copier’s web interface via your PC/server.

,T20230526.0107,CPOMS logging,"Hi,

I don't know if this is your realm or if this is something that is
intentionally set-up this way, but I was wondering if you'd be able to
reconfigure how the CPOMS reporting is done.

Currently, we have to select each member of staff individually and remember
their names. At other schools, CPOMS is set up so that you can add a year
group's pastoral team with one click and can search by the year team. It
can also be set up so that groups of people are informed for a log relating
to a student (e.g. automatically including the form teacher, but there's
also the option to uncheck them if you want).

Would it be possible to do this? This would save everyone several minutes
each day, which would quickly save hours across the whole community.

Many thanks,
Bettina

Hi loves,

It's summer which means songwriting....we tried last year unsuccessfully
but please could you again ask vital if they could unblock this website:

https://learningmusic.ableton.com/

on the chrome books for the children to use? Other schools use it so it
must be possible plus it's free and the best thing ever....

Thanks

Vikki

Thank you for the email.

Again Marcus Goodwin has replied from our ICT support and not had a reply
from you or your team. This is very frustrating as we need the connection
fixing. Please can you confirm a date and time next week with Marcus
directly. Here is the email address that you need to use help@vitalyork.com

Patrick Baskett Lopez (ITT142)

I have left his sims login as active, but his employment details ended on 19th May and there have not been any further employment dates added.

I have re-activated his ClassCharts login, but I think this will archive itself automatically until his new employment dates are entered.

If this happens then Sarah McAtominey or Paula Edwards can re-activate his login (in my absence).

Thanks,
Claire

,T20230526.0038,Projector B07 not filling whole screen,"Good morning,

I altered the monitor resolution so that it filled the whole screen. However, now the projector is now not projecting as large as it was before. I've tried changing the setting back to how they were but still no joy.
Could you point me in the right direction?

I am teaching period 2 but the classroom should be empty from break time through period 3 till the beginning of lunch if you need to come and have a look at it.

Many thanks

Alex

A few bits that we could usefully have fixed in history!


1.       The mouse on the staff workroom PC is dead - the left click button isn't registering

2.       The projector in P13 keeps threatening to explode-  its's getting very needy about it's bulb

3.       The computer in P11 is having working memory issues and failing to open outlook/teams or even a standard PPT without having a strop.

Hope all the technical terminology above makes sense!
Thanks
Hugh

This is a bit silly and I don't know if you can help but you don't know if
you don't ask!

I'm struggling to register that Jason's phone is ringing sometimes.

It's quiet and the tone is really melodic like it just blends into the
background.

I've had a fiddle myself on the settings but for some reason it's not
saving.

If you're able to help please would you mind?

I'm in the scholarship office.

Yes this is an issue with the fibre from the main block, however until we
have funds released to carry out the changes in this area we can't really
do much.

It is down to be fully upgraded in the summer holidays but I will keep you
posted.

Apologies for the issue this is causing, I wonder if you could try an
office on the main corridor for your calls until this is sorted (possibly
next to CCO?)

,T20230525.0105,Unblocking Facebook,"Hello,

We are hoping to set up a school Facebook account for Sigglesthorne CE
Primary Academy to attract more prospective parents to our school, as many
of our most recent parents tell us that they do not use Twitter. I wondered
if you could unblock Facebook for us so that we can set up a school account
and have access to this while at school?

Also there is an existing Facebook account for our school already that is
out of date. We have tried to log into the existing account with no luck.
Is there a way to close down this account that we no longer have access to?

Kind regards,
Sophie

,T20230525.0075,Laptop,"Hi, I am still awaiting a new laptop.

It's now at the point where it turns off the instant it is not plugged in.
This has become severely frustrating as I cannot take work from room to
room without restarting the whole thing. This is adding a good 15-20
minutes of wasted time to my workload every day due to me dividing my
duties between the progress leader's office for pastoral/phone calls and my
lab for lessons and having to reboot each time.

Please can this be addressed soon as I have flagged this multiple times
since around Christmas and, despite being told multiple times I would get a
new one, nothing so far has materialised.

Hi Stacey,

Sorry but I have to moan to you about the printer situation. Repro room
needs toner, G1 is still not working despite having asked to be looked at
at least a week ago. We need to print out coursework for sending off and
this is seriously impacting us now. Can you somehow kick Vital a bit to get
this sorted ASAP?

Thank you
Miriam

you can help! It started doing this a few weeks ago but it’s got worse to
the point where it’s done it 4 times in the space of 15 minutes. This
glitchy thing is usually on the monitor, sometimes it turns itself off. I
don’t know if there’s anything you can do but it’s becoming unworkable and
I know other peoples are doing it too.

I have an AV1 robot which we are trying to connect to the wifi so a child
who is at home unwell can access remote education.

It is connecting to the 4G however it's not strong enough and it keeps
dropping out so they cannot connect.

Can you please liaise with the no isolation team to get it to be able to
access the wifi please? I am only able to add the password, but it needs
the ports open for it to connect.

Email

You may be familiar with these as York schools are starting to use them as
remote education options.

It's quite urgent as we were hoping to start using it tomorrow.

Many thanks

Hello,

I can confirm your device is not currently communicating to us, please email me to schedule a time that is best to run a remote session to connect your machine, or if you would prefer, you can forward my request on to a member of your IT team.

The session should only last 5-10 minutes (per device connection), providing there are no complications. I will need the IP address of the copier to hand as I will need to browse to the copier’s web interface via your PC/server.

Lesley Snell said she gets a message popping up telling her that she has a
temporary profile.  She is also having ongoing issues with the 'Follow me'
printer option disappearing, which is only sorted if she logs off and logs
back on again (which is a pain!).  Might the two be linked?  Also what does
it mean when it says she has a temp profile?  She was on a short-term
contract but it's being extended to the summer holidays.

From: rmintegris <rmintegris@rm.com>
Date: Wed, 24 May 2023 at 12:03
Subject: RM Integris URL Change - Update
To: rmintegris <rmintegris@rm.com>


Dear Customer,



Further to our previous communication regarding the planned change to the
Integris URL (website address), we are pleased to confirm that the change
is scheduled to take place this coming weekend and will be in place by *7pm
Sunday 28th May 2023. *



The following notifications were published yesterday on both Integris
messages and our status page.  For further information please refer to the
help article referenced in the post below.



*Maintenance window* – *Integris Downtime*

The following maintenance window will be required resulting in Integris
being unavailable between *4.30am Saturday 27th May – 7pm Sunday 28th May.*

If your school has setup its own DataShare link (API) to pull data into a
bespoke database that your school has setup, please also refrain from
pulling API data during this maintenance window.



*Date of planned change to the Integris URL*

The Integris URL is planned to change this coming weekend, so from *7pm on
Sunday, 28th May* you will need to use the new Integris URL.

Please refer to the following help page for action you may need to take and
for further information:
https://help.rmintegris.com/integris-url-is-changing

If there are any changes to this date, we will advise you accordingly.



*What if I access Integris from RM Unify?*

If you use either one of the ready-made Integris app tiles or if your
school has created one of their own link tiles to access and log in to
Integris, either way our team will be updating the Integris URL for you.
Please refer to our help page for further information:
https://help.rmintegris.com/integris-url-is-changing



*What will happen if I forget to use the new URL?*

If you use the old URL a page will appear advising you of the change,
together with a link to the new URL whilst also reminding the user to
update their shortcut or bookmark.



*Who do I contact if I need help?*
If you have any queries or need further assistance, please contact your
usual RM Integris Support Partner in the first instance.



With best wishes





*SESL MIS Team*

Date: Wed, 24 May 2023 at 10:39
Subject: Important - Cloud Server Changes Beginning June 3rd
To: Karen <k.bramhill@bhs.hlt.academy>


Simple changes are required, please read here to find out more...
*Important Info For All Cloud Based Customers*
Dear Karen,

We want to ensure you have the best possible experience with Accessit. As
part of our commitment to providing you with top-quality service, we are
transitioning to a new state-of-the-art data center. This means that all
our current UK customers will be migrated to this new infrastructure.

*What does this mean for you?*

This transition will mean improved performance and stability of our
services. During the weekend of* June 3rd and 4th, there may be minor
service disruptions*. We will make every effort to keep these disruptions
to a minimum.

The *complete domain changeover will take place on June 18th*. This means
you have ample time to apply the necessary changes. However, to ensure a
smooth transition, we need your cooperation.

*What do you need to do?*

Update your firewall rules: Please contact your IT technicians and request
them to allow an outbound connection to the following details:


*IP Address: 149.137.219.247 TCP Port: 2731*

Do note that some customers will need to update the configuration file in
their locally installed application folder to connect to the new server. We
can either email you the updated file or our Tech Support team can modify
the existing file directly after June 4th. No other changes to your current
workflow will be required.
If you have any questions or require assistance, *please don't hesitate to
contact our support team* at support@accessitlibrary.com.

We appreciate your understanding and patience during this transitional
phase. We are confident that this move will significantly improve your
overall experience with Accessit.

Kind regards,
*The Accessit Team*

I've been having some trouble as I currently have access to a desktop
computer in the science prep room (G43), but I often need to do work
outside of the prep room. I also do not have a webcam on my desktop
computer, which makes it difficult to participate in online meetings. I was
wondering if it would be possible to have a laptop/Chromebook to use at all?

Many thanks,

Zoe

We've been busy making upgrades to our programmes to improve their speed and stability in the classroom.

In order for these changes to take effect, there are some new domains and sub-domains that’ll need to be added to your school network’s whitelist. These are as follows:

• d10pzylrlqx53u.cloudfront.net
• d3up3ys30fpr5f.cloudfront.net
• ds55r85pjmty2.cloudfront.net

• doodle-uk-prod-concept-explanations.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com
• doodle-uk-prod-addressables.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com

These addresses will go live in early June, but they can be added to your school’s whitelist before this date.

If your staff or IT coordinator would like any help with setting these up, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with your School Success Advisor or our Customer Success team by visiting our Help Centre<http://url7934.doodlelearning.com/ls/click?upn=-2FcdG76kV6wAK5igQhlQgHOZbXj8aLXbuOzw7aliFPrDhxK5pZBTM2gNfqlJpLeFjuRBv_62i4ZQidJAut2vx9TYnJ89tfTklrsabFYe7di2PzcGtiS7u5wPn1QxyMEk-2Fk3GoH54nqIC3exsTyofo4jTZDggEEh1wP-2F5qTGhpTwIHZAGPQCdmm74vqSKnKF-2Fyai4EuPRR0TREjb323vQNYmpZSAp8e9Dd1x1QLrc5eNpTVaA0MVmX29UXloXFwbd6DQUi5OZ3tUKnNV24bARkspcNCviYBHGJlR6FZR2KMUI9ZazWmh5DxYBwyUp2ei2ik-2B0Um3WaiIDhaPgH4d5WBLRaJqoIWS5UatcDiNlY3T0cTpr1GyMl2bxnbatGK4ToECO-2Bv04Yth-2BT61fhJ-2F-2BdB3qQ6WheGsIC0tAXwjL-2FcpWHM0Smd4X5xUbdqrzNwIxEjUKJ4Z-2BlDWzYsf7H8EVUklBH6bCYHcKHWSGFs6X0iIpuaM-2Bb9elRfeZE5-2FsU-2BuaZ0ZCW-2Fc-2FZb-2FsWr1EC-2FMl6Htydk5VSFnCBd5i4RuOrD8kY24-2B6yM4DFk-2FghZD5w-2BSkKpsGZeuhScFmLcNcr37cUgRTAtp148TqHM1SY3IvtVUAWvTlIHMkah-2Fv2iiad4ioKeX12srvOAYVNbjsGktjFfimUmANIgX-2BzvhdYRpmA-2FgQ8vebVaXJZeU6NE22yh8XGO60SG8naQNwJSG2BkIai56Uix9Z1xZwQ-2BXRRODL-2BhayHom9XN8KQorNYkoAXviIz0gleysmes-2BROu0fh3VCoPM8oBnGNTdjRpGIbZJpDDz9XgVqAlwRiTFAS88VLR3kbEfDFnrcEGmgngFy2zOu5BIM-2Bxz223kc3ppSyd-2By1p7EBfwwUCJDc1g7GOY3c3pJTFKspZ8rT6gmc95OkMxdNQKwCWtfBOHxLTnnQPN0TsQcM8JYhimsMjpAGO2ghEryFl4LZOW6x7gLnOueLbo7kbJmQDh7ryNX7kpTWdfYjw1srqZD1reFZomYoiWUiKtj1ScyxCS9ZOXinKiiDfroWE6TbxOqSli5PlgERhoFk-2FCYNhTkALdBAVanRiy6aKlxxCxBhZbAonraSiWu7qSa3cimAXzqjUjRG1rVLwgEiwUWnjbQ-3D> and clicking on the green circle icon.

Sorry about this!! Today I have managed to log onto the computer in R09 today, but no matter which menu I go through I can't get the projector to pick up the computer. I have also checked the leads into the computer. There are a couple of leads hanging out of the projector, but I seem to think this is often the case?
Thank you
Rachel

I tried to reset the password for PC log on, but I get a box appearing
stating that the password cannot he used.

I did the same reset for five other students in the same lesson and had no

I can only assume it is a problem with her account. Until this is resolved
she cannot use the PC to complete any CAD work.

Tony has asked if the Wifi in room A126 can be moved, he said to ask him
for details.

Also, In class 20, Annika's room, the computer 65VX95J is being very slow.

Additionally, i think Kirstie mentioned about passing Debs Cutler's old
Adobe account over to myself, as she's left, so I can edit PDF's, etc.

,T20230523.0029,St James Governor Email Accounts,"Good Morning,

Please could I request a new governor email address to be set up for Tony
Baker at St. James' Church of England Academy. Tony will need to be added
to the mailing list for all governors (and any other specific email mailing
lists for St James' governors) as well please.

Please could I request a new governor email address to be set up for Clare
Baker at St. James' Church of England Academy. Clare will need to be added
to the mailing list for all governors (and any other specific email mailing
lists for St James' governors) as well please.

Please could I ask that any initial set up account info + password be sent
to myself in the first instance? The school or myself will then contact
Tony and Clare to update them/get them started.

Please could you also ensure that Margaret Capes (m.capes@stj.hslt.academy)
is added to any 'all governor' email accounts in relation to St James', if
not already. Thank you.

If you require any further information, please let me know.

Hi Tim,



This was discussed in our meeting in relation to off site filtering.

   1. *Off site Filtering:*

We have a couple of options

1.       Proxy – F.O.C

Schools Broadband to set up proxy ports and send over to each trust for
testing. – SBB - Support Team / Helena Brook

2.       EnClient – Chargeable per device

This is a paid for option which will be explored should option 1 not meet
the trusts requirements.

Thanks,



Kind Regards,

,T20230522.0180,Laptop for Nanth Kaur,"Hi James & Jonathan

Nanth has been in this morning to start her online training, but there is obviously a lot to do and she needs to complete it by the end of half term.

I have just spoken to Gail and she agreed - would it be possible to loan Nanth a laptop to take home and complete her training please?

It would obviously need to be configured so she cannot access any school documents.

She just needs to have internet access to complete the online training (Tes Develop).

If you can let me know when this could be made available so that I can contact Nanth to come in and collect.

Thanks

Susan

Hello,



I can confirm your device is not currently communicating to us, please
email me to schedule a time that is best to run a remote session to connect
your machine, or if you would prefer, you can forward my request on to a
member of your IT team.



The session should only last 5-10 minutes (per device connection),
providing there are no complications. I will need the IP address of the
copier to hand as I will need to browse to the copier’s web interface via
your PC/server.

,T20230522.0139,Problems with LRC Chromebooks,"Hi all,

I am emailing regarding the chromebooks in the LRC and their use for GL
Assessment.

I have attempted to use these chromebooks today to complete PTE with 8KS.4,
a class of 15 students.

Two of the chromebooks have been used for something called Trelson
Assessment, and now can no longer be signed in using any of our Google
logins or be logged in as Guest and therefore are not viable for the GL
Assessment.

One other chomebook is displaying the test in Ukrainian and we are unable
to reset this.

This has resulted in one student not being able to complete the test
today.  Both other chromebook trolleys and all other chrombebooks are being
used by clases of 33 and 32 during these same lessons and so are
unavailable.

We are scheduled to complete the second PTE Test in the LRC during Period 5
tomorrow.

Any help or support solving these issue so that this problem is not
repeated would be greatly appreciated

Hi,

Please can we have the toner replaced in the English printer? It has the

We've tried switching it off and back on, but it didn't work this time.

You may have done, and the mouse I now have may be a new one? The dodgy one
is intermittently freezing and jumping, so it is too early to say if the
one I have is old or new. If that makes sense?

,T20230522.0013,Machine at the back of 307,"Morning pal,

This is probably a really easy fix but I've unplugged and plugged back in
many times to no avail. The machine in the back right corner of the room
turns on, both tower and monitor but just says 'DP input' yet shows nothing
on the screen. Could you pop and have a little peak please?

Thank you,
Tom.

I seem to be unable to email the group fog.alltas (I get a mail delivery

really need access to this, both for situations when I am replying all with

look when he was here recently and said they weren't worth keeping.  I
can't remember though exactly what he said about getting rid of them - are
you able to collect them, or would we need to arrange that ourselves
with someone like the Council?

Can I also please request a quote for a laptop that we can use with the new
screen that's been fitted in our reception area - we discovered that the
laptop that was connected to the old screen didn't work when the new screen
got fitted. It doesn't need to be anything fancy.

Many thanks,
Carrie

Subject: Integris clarity
To:


Dear all



The provider of Integris, RM, recently contacted all school users about
changes within their company.  It’s come to our attention that this email
has worried some schools about the longevity of Integris.



As most of you will be aware:

   - You have a contract with RM for your Integris licence
   - CYC MIS provide you with support in using Integris



*To reassure and clarify*, we have been in touch with RM:

   - Integris is still your management information system
   - There are *no *imminent plans for Integris to be removed from the
   market.  RM have assured us that they are as committed to supporting
   schools and partners in their new home.



What do you need to do:

   - RM have recently sold some elements of the business and changed the
   name of the arm of the business that includes Integris.  Due to this, an
   email asking schools to update their invoicing details has been
   distributed.  However, if you receive finance support through CYC,
   invoicing details have been updated accordingly.
   - The website address that you use to access Integris will also change
   shortly.  There is currently a notice on the login page – please make sure
   this new website is allowed on your network so that when the address
   changes, the change will be easier.



Hopefully this reassures you.  We have fed back to RM that their recent
emails caused some concern.  If we get an updates, we will share.



Please can you share with relevant colleagues in your school?



Many thanks, Hannah

Hi Sam

It looks like your *SIMS* connection with Wonde isn’t working as expected.
This will affect the syncing and updating of any information between *Aspire

*Please be assured, even though the connection is failing, your data is

Access the machine and open SIMS.net

If you get a SIMS error message when attempting to log in then the recent

server.

If you are able to open SIMS.net please re-apply the latest SIMS client
update to the server and reboot again.

*Once the above steps are complete*, please email

,T20230519.0088,IT equipment for York ISSP Summer School,"Hi Ben,

Hope you're ok. York ISSP (cc'ed) will be hosting their annual Summer
School at Manor from Tuesday 25th - Friday 28th July. There will be a
number of Y7-10 students on site from different local schools who will be
engaging with a range of masterclasses run by teachers from across the
city. We are in the process of liaising with these teachers to identify
what IT devices/equipment their classes will need access to during the week
so we can book appropriate facilities and equipment.

So that we can advise staff correctly, please could you let me know if
there is still a computer room at Manor? Can you also let me know how many
chromebooks and iPads there are and whether these would be available during
that week for student use?

,T20230519.0062,Studybugs Sync Lost Connection at Manor Church of England Academy,"From Studybugs Support <support@studybugs.com>: Hi there,

We’ve noticed there has been a problem connecting to Studybugs Sync (our
SIMS integration) at Manor Church of England Academy, meaning Studybugs
can’t sync live attendance data for York City Council. Are you aware of any
problems accessing the internet at school, any issues with SIMS at school,
or any issues with the server where Studybugs Sync is running? We last
connected to Studybugs Sync yesterday.

A good starting point is to open the “ *Studybugs Sync Service Configurator*”
tool from the Windows Start Menu on the SIMS server which should then
highlight any issues.

Kind regards,
Lee​

Dear Vanessa,



Thank you for contacting us regarding SIMS Next Gen.



There are checks and steps needed to enable your school to be Fit for Next
Gen which are fully detailed in the following Getting Ready guide (the main
highlights are summarized below along with who is most likely to be
completing them):



*Getting ready for SIMS Next Gen*
<https://customer.support-ess.com/csm?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=5960d82e1bbce510455842a7b04bcb22&spa=1>



A couple of the tasks require a valid SIMS ID account. You can use the
following setup account to complete these tasks.  The username for this
account is:



Initial.Admin452@identityfor.simsid.placeholder.co.uk



I will send the password in a separate email.  The Getting Ready guide
above will explain how to log on to SIMS ID to complete the required tasks.
*Checklist – Technician*

   - Is Installed & up to date (version 1.4.7.1)
   - SIMS Usage Package is installed and switched on
   - SIMS Data Exchange Service Package is installed



*Finishing Touches*:

I have enabled the DeX (Data Exchange) Services Tile and installed the Next
Gen Home Tile to enable you to complete your finishing touches.



   - Input Client ID and Secret into SIMS Data Exchange Service Package
   - Switch on
   - Wait overnight for Sync


*Data Preparation – School Administrator – **Step 7 in Getting Ready for
SIMS Next Gen link*



There are some recommended housekeeping tasks to be actioned by your school
to ensure all staff can access Next Gen functionality



   - Work email address set to ""Work"" and ""Main"" in their Personnel record
   - Allocate teachers and teaching assistants to classes in the pastoral
   structure. (optional)
   - Assign the correct roles/permissions in SIM7 System Manager to staff



*Finishing Touches - *Once all the above steps and checks have taken
place

Hi Carrie,

I am emailing on the off chance that you might be able to help...I had
asked Andy McBride as ICT coordinator to help with getting switch access to
the computers up and running again but unfortunately he didn't get round to
it before he left.

We have some of these boxes in school that connect to the computers via a
USB cable.  You then plug in an access switch so the children can control
certain programmes on the computer for cause and effect activities etc:

[image: image.png]
The software used to be on the system and you could plug the box in via USB
and change what the switches controlled (space bar press, enter press etc)
from the program.  It disappeared a while ago when the computers were
updated.  I've had a search on the internet and this seems to be it
https://www.cricksoft.com/uk/support/downloads/usb-keys-2-(windows).  But I
don't think I can install it on the school system.  It would be great to
get the switches back up and running, please could you see if you can ask
the IT company that provides school service to download the program so we
can see if the boxes still work?

Thanks,
Sarah

That would be great, thank you. Could I get those details please, and an
idea of how to use the printer, as I have some PHSE resources that I need
to print for Period 1 tomorrow morning.

Many thanks,

Date: Thu, 18 May 2023 at 09:20
Subject: Attention: All RM Integris Users
To:


Good morning,



*For the attention of all customers who access either Live or Archive
Integris MIS *You will already be aware of the move for RM Integris to SESL
(Schools Educational Services Ltd) and as part of this move, we will be
required to change the web address in which you access Integris in the
coming weeks. This applies to whether you access either a Live or Archive
copy of Integris.

As you will be aware we have recently updated Integris to v3.178
https://help.rmintegris.com/v3.178 where we have added an in-app message
that informs you of the new Integris URL for your school when accessing
Integris directly via a web browser bookmark/shortcut.  Importantly it also
advises you to arrange with your technical support whitelisting of the new
domain names.   If accessing Integris through RM Unify (RM Integris Plus)
then RM Unify will handle the change of URL and bookmarks and shortcuts
will not need to be changed, however the new domains should still be
whitelisted to prevent access issues.



*Whitelisting New Domain Names *

Within a MAT, local authority, or school you will likely have some sort of
network security solution such as a firewall which protects an
establishment from unwanted traffic and to block malware.  These rules also
prevent users within the network from accessing certain websites and
programs to protect staff and pupils.  As we are changing the website
address of Integris, the firewall may also need to be updated, and to
whitelist the new Integris domain name to prevent it from getting blocked.
A typical firewall uses a whitelist policy where certain websites you trust
are added to prevent them from getting blocked.  Please consult with your
technical teams to ensure your firewall or any other similar security
system you may have in place have the following domains added to the
whitelist.  Sometimes the whitelist is managed centrally by a local
authority, MAT or managed service.  The firewall whitelist should be
updated in either case of accessing Integris through a direct URL or
through RM Unify.



This should be in place *by Friday 26th May* at the latest and can be added
sooner.   Any reference to existing Integris whitelist entries should
remain in place for now.



The domain names to be added to the whitelist are as follows:

*.integris-education.com

*.sesl-education.com



*What will happen if I forget to use the new URL?*

If you use the old URL a page will appear advising you of the change,
together with a link to the new URL whilst also reminding the user to
update their shortcut or bookmark.



*Who do I contact if I need help?*
If you have any queries or need further assistance, please contact your
usual RM Integris Support Partner in the first instance.



With best wishes





*SESL MIS Team*

Subject: Attention: All RM Integris Users
To:


Good morning,



*For the attention of all customers who access either Live or Archive
Integris MIS *You will already be aware of the move for RM Integris to SESL
(Schools Educational Services Ltd) and as part of this move, we will be
required to change the web address in which you access Integris in the
coming weeks. This applies to whether you access either a Live or Archive
copy of Integris.

As you will be aware we have recently updated Integris to v3.178
https://help.rmintegris.com/v3.178 where we have added an in-app message
that informs you of the new Integris URL for your school when accessing
Integris directly via a web browser bookmark/shortcut.  Importantly it also
advises you to arrange with your technical support whitelisting of the new
domain names.   If accessing Integris through RM Unify (RM Integris Plus)
then RM Unify will handle the change of URL and bookmarks and shortcuts
will not need to be changed, however the new domains should still be
whitelisted to prevent access issues.



*Whitelisting New Domain Names *

Within a MAT, local authority, or school you will likely have some sort of
network security solution such as a firewall which protects an
establishment from unwanted traffic and to block malware.  These rules also
prevent users within the network from accessing certain websites and
programs to protect staff and pupils.  As we are changing the website
address of Integris, the firewall may also need to be updated, and to
whitelist the new Integris domain name to prevent it from getting blocked.
A typical firewall uses a whitelist policy where certain websites you trust
are added to prevent them from getting blocked.  Please consult with your
technical teams to ensure your firewall or any other similar security
system you may have in place have the following domains added to the
whitelist.  Sometimes the whitelist is managed centrally by a local
authority, MAT or managed service.  The firewall whitelist should be
updated in either case of accessing Integris through a direct URL or
through RM Unify.



This should be in place *by Friday 26th May* at the latest and can be added
sooner.   Any reference to existing Integris whitelist entries should
remain in place for now.



The domain names to be added to the whitelist are as follows:

*.integris-education.com

*.sesl-education.com



*What will happen if I forget to use the new URL?*

If you use the old URL a page will appear advising you of the change,
together with a link to the new URL whilst also reminding the user to
update their shortcut or bookmark.



*Who do I contact if I need help?*
If you have any queries or need further assistance, please contact your
usual RM Integris Support Partner in the first instance.



With best wishes





*SESL MIS Team*

Hi Michelle,
Sorry, busy week this week.

Unfortunately, I don't have any logins for the iPads in school. I know we
discussed possibly moving all the iPads onto a management system run by
NPCAT but this would take a bit of time to get setup then move all the
devices onto it. I think we will look at those once the email migrations
have been completed.

If you contact Vital, they should be able to deploy the PE Passport
application to managed devices and may have login information for the other
iPads.

Sorry I can't be of more help.

Warm regards,
Jack

Subject: Attention: All RM Integris Users
To:


Good morning,



*For the attention of all customers who access either Live or Archive
Integris MIS *You will already be aware of the move for RM Integris to SESL
(Schools Educational Services Ltd) and as part of this move, we will be
required to change the web address in which you access Integris in the
coming weeks. This applies to whether you access either a Live or Archive
copy of Integris.

As you will be aware we have recently updated Integris to v3.178
https://help.rmintegris.com/v3.178 where we have added an in-app message
that informs you of the new Integris URL for your school when accessing
Integris directly via a web browser bookmark/shortcut.  Importantly it also
advises you to arrange with your technical support whitelisting of the new
domain names.   If accessing Integris through RM Unify (RM Integris Plus)
then RM Unify will handle the change of URL and bookmarks and shortcuts
will not need to be changed, however the new domains should still be
whitelisted to prevent access issues.



*Whitelisting New Domain Names *

Within a MAT, local authority, or school you will likely have some sort of
network security solution such as a firewall which protects an
establishment from unwanted traffic and to block malware.  These rules also
prevent users within the network from accessing certain websites and
programs to protect staff and pupils.  As we are changing the website
address of Integris, the firewall may also need to be updated, and to
whitelist the new Integris domain name to prevent it from getting blocked.
A typical firewall uses a whitelist policy where certain websites you trust
are added to prevent them from getting blocked.  Please consult with your
technical teams to ensure your firewall or any other similar security
system you may have in place have the following domains added to the
whitelist.  Sometimes the whitelist is managed centrally by a local
authority, MAT or managed service.  The firewall whitelist should be
updated in either case of accessing Integris through a direct URL or
through RM Unify.



This should be in place *by Friday 26th May* at the latest and can be added
sooner.   Any reference to existing Integris whitelist entries should
remain in place for now.



The domain names to be added to the whitelist are as follows:

*.integris-education.com

*.sesl-education.com



*What will happen if I forget to use the new URL?*

If you use the old URL a page will appear advising you of the change,
together with a link to the new URL whilst also reminding the user to
update their shortcut or bookmark.



*Who do I contact if I need help?*
If you have any queries or need further assistance, please contact your
usual RM Integris Support Partner in the first instance.



With best wishes





*SESL MIS Team*

One of our staff got married recently and has changed her name - Aimee
Brinton is now Aimee Williams.  Is it possible to change her email from
a.brinton@ebor.academy to a.williams@ebor.academy, change her display name
to Mrs Williams, and for any emails sent to her old address to be forwarded
to her new one? Is there a way of merging the accounts somehow, I vaguely
remember you doing something like that before?

Also I might as well tell you as most people know now - I'm going back to
TIG in a few weeks...I've realised very quickly I'm not cut out for a big
school so applied for my old job back, all just confirmed this week so I'll
be back there from early July. So please don't close my TIG account down-
although I doubt anyone will have asked you to do that yet anyway!

,T20230517.0203,"Fwd: Password problems, updates and lost time in learning","Please can I have some advice on passwords for students. A teacher has
given me some comprehensive feedback on the challenges of resetting
passwords and the disruption that this has on teaching. Is the password
process the same across the trust or is the option to give teachers the
facility to reset passwords? I understand why we now have two passwords but
we are interested to know if other schools have a similar level of issues
and if not what do they do differently? I can't measure how many students
are abusing the system and taking the opportunity to spend time away from
the lesson or how many struggle to remember passwords. We can't cover the
IT office at all hours so students are toing and froing between classrooms
when you are not at their desk.

<m.zulkarnain@voy.hslt.academy>


I have raised this question before, however now want to address this again
as the impact is greater.

At present I am unable to reset passwords at any level.

What this results in is that students having to leave the lesson and get
their password reset. This results in them losing learning time and
potentially causing behavioural issues around school. I imagine some also
take advantage of this, as a teacher I have no way of knowing.

This loss of time is compounded if the person who can reset the passwords
is unavailable, as they are busy elsewhere. I imagine that will always be a
potential risk.

An example of how much this impacts is that today I wanted to complete an
assessed piece of work, using PC’s and CAD during lesson 4. I have had 7
students who need passwords resetting for either PC or Google. They could
not complete their CAD assessment this lesson and has also resulted in them
starting to become frustrated and some negative behavioural issues, due to
their frustration.

In addition to the issue of the passwords there are more and more software
updates being requested and this then causes the PC to re-boot after
logging in, resulting in more delays and more time being wasted. Is it
possible to schedule the updates overnight?

Can we please look at a more effective system, in terms of reducing the
loss to learning? I understand that since the “incident” we need more
complex password systems; however at present some students also struggle to
cope with the complexity of the new system. They are issued a new password
and then once logged in then have to renew that password; some struggle to
do this as they are not not aware of the complexity of the password
required. Others just forget the password. They also now have two passwords
to remember; one for the PC and one for Google Classroom.

I have worked in several schools and two in this trust, at all schools I as
a basic teacher have had password control access, to reset a password of a
student. I have taught for 26 years and for many of those delivered IT and
Computer Science, so I am aware of the need of security protocols. However
the current system is detrimental to making good progress for a number of
students when trying to use IT to enhance learning.

Thank you

Ed

Hi Ms Landon



I still haven’t heart from the IT department and Michael still doesn’t have
log in for google classroom. Please can you sort this ASAP as he is unable
to access school work and it has been over a week now.



Many thanks

,T20230517.0138,USB DVD drives,"Hi James

I know some depts were given a DVD drive or two for use after the PCs ditched their disc drives. I help to set up exams with A/V needs each year and end up lending the Music dept drives, which isn't ideal.

Are there any spares around that exams can have and keep for future exams? It'd be a great help to me if there was a box of A/V gear for exams that I could just grab each year and get set up. Scrambling around each year is a bit of a pain. If not, I'll ask Jonathan to buy some more DVD drives for exams to have.

Thanks

Someone told me that their school have borrowed beebots from you in the
past. Is there a cost for this or is this something you offer all schools
that you support?

---------- Forwarded message ---------
From: phil <phil@trundlebug.co.uk>
Date: Wed, 17 May 2023 at 10:39
Subject: Parent Bulletin images
To: <reception@ahs.pmat.academy>

Hi,

This is a potential ""bug report"" for whoever sends out the Parent
Bulletin each week.

The most recent Parent Bulletin (sent out Monday 15 May) contained no
images.  Specifically, the ""Head of Year Awards"" section was empty again.

Last week, I assumed that the section was empty because none had been
awarded, but there are several mentions of the winners within the ""A
message from the pastoral team"" sections this week.

It may be that the image was just forgotten both weeks, of course.   I
highlight this in case there is a bug with system that sends out the
messages and no one has reported it to you yet because we all assume the
attachment just got forgotten.

Best wishes,

Phil.

,T20230516.0158,"Password problems, updates and lost time in learning","I have raised this question before, however now want to address this again
as the impact is greater.

At present I am unable to reset passwords at any level.

What this results in is that students having to leave the lesson and get
their password reset. This results in them losing learning time and
potentially causing behavioural issues around school. I imagine some also
take advantage of this, as a teacher I have no way of knowing.

This loss of time is compounded if the person who can reset the passwords
is unavailable, as they are busy elsewhere. I imagine that will always be a
potential risk.

An example of how much this impacts is that today I wanted to complete an
assessed piece of work, using PC’s and CAD during lesson 4. I have had 7
students who need passwords resetting for either PC or Google. They could
not complete their CAD assessment this lesson and has also resulted in them
starting to become frustrated and some negative behavioural issues, due to
their frustration.

In addition to the issue of the passwords there are more and more software
updates being requested and this then causes the PC to re-boot after
logging in, resulting in more delays and more time being wasted. Is it
possible to schedule the updates overnight?

Can we please look at a more effective system, in terms of reducing the
loss to learning? I understand that since the “incident” we need more
complex password systems; however at present some students also struggle to
cope with the complexity of the new system. They are issued a new password
and then once logged in then have to renew that password; some struggle to
do this as they are not not aware of the complexity of the password
required. Others just forget the password. They also now have two passwords
to remember; one for the PC and one for Google Classroom.

I have worked in several schools and two in this trust, at all schools I as
a basic teacher have had password control access, to reset a password of a
student. I have taught for 26 years and for many of those delivered IT and
Computer Science, so I am aware of the need of security protocols. However
the current system is detrimental to making good progress for a number of
students when trying to use IT to enhance learning.

Thank you

Ed

Please can you let me have a school email address for Zulma Hernandez Herrera (ZHH on SIMs).  She started on 21/04/23.  Not sure why it didn't pull through in the usual way.

She is a teaching assistant in MFL.

need to use something other than A4. So when I want to print the only way
around it is to manually stand at the printer, select ALT then choose A4
then print.

I also am unable to send anything to Follow Me printers in the office from
the laptop and the green Paper Cut pop up never pops up now. I suspect the
two are linked.

Can you please help as printing is really painful at present  and I have a

Hi Andrew,

Im have problems trying to open up the emails into Outlook as it just crashes or has issues every time. I'm currently migrating emails into the VOY Sar folder but this crashed the first time I tried it. Ive started the process before and it was trying to transfer almost 6000 files. I need some support urgently as I cant even start the process of sifting through 1000's of emails until I get it into a usable format.

Thanks

Good morning



I hope you are well?



Just a quick email to let you know that Openreach have completed all works
on the leased line and handover has been issued. We’re ready to agree a
date for the switchover and go live. In preparation, please can you
complete and return the attached technical information? I’ll then send out
your new broadband equipment.



Please can you also let me know when you’d like to do the go live
appointment? Our engineer will support remotely on the day, but we will
require your IT support on site at the school.



Thanks in advance.

Hi Jackie

Thank you for returning your system refresh documentation.

Our next available date for your refresh is 26/05/2023. I have reserved this date for you until close of business Tuesday (16/05/2023). If you could confirm suitability as soon as possible, it would be greatly appreciated. If we haven’t received confirmation by this date, the reservation will be removed and we will need to arrange a new date.

We do require your IT support technician to assist the engineer with network ports/network IP addresses, testing the backup, testing the MIS, installing Anti-Virus and adding the InVentry admin software to the various computers.

The new version of the software will require a backup location, for the InVentry database, that will be hosted from the InVentry touchscreen when it is installed. To do this we require a network share setting up on a server that is onsite. The folder created will need to be directly shared out, so the backup will be something like (\\Server01\Inventrybackup$). Please could an ‘InVentry’ active directory username and password (a service account) be created and then attached to the Share & Security permissions. Once the share has been created, please could you email over just the share path and username? We do not require the password to be emailed, but please could this be provided to the engineer on arrival at site.

PLEASE NOTE: Your system will be down whilst the upgrade is taking place. You will need to have alternative methods in place for signing in and out to ensure you have live records for fire evacuation purposes until the works are complete. We recommend using a paper list to record Visitor, Staff and Pupil Sign In's/ Out's.

Your InVentry Training



Following the completion of your physical installation our engineer will conduct your introductory training session, approximately 30 minutes in length. This will only take place if social distancing (2-metre distance) can be adhered to throughout.



To receive the best possible training, we recommend it takes place in a room with a projector or electronic screen so your onsite staff can be trained safely and with good visibility. Alternatively, training can take place around your newly installed InVentry screen or onsite staff computers.



Following on from your introductory training, our training team will conduct a post installation training session which will be carried out via remote webinar. If our engineer is unable to complete your introductory training session on the day of installation, this training will be covered within the webinar, so no information will be missed.



If you’d like to book your post installation training webinar now, you can do so by using the following link:

https://training.inventry.co.uk/



Upon arrival, the engineer will discuss with you the best approach to complete training. This conversation will happen immediately so the necessary arrangements can be made for the training to take place safely.



Due to having to carry heavy tools and equipment, we kindly ask if our engineer can park within your onsite car park. If this is not possible, please could you advise on nearby parking facilities that our engineer can use.



Your InVentry equipment is going to be shipped directly to your site before your installation. It will be directed to the address discussed and confirmed during the implementation phase - this will be marked for your attention. The package will be shipped in a large, reinforced cardboard box, which will be clearly labelled with ‘InVentry’. This box should only be opened by your InVentry engineer, otherwise it could void the warranty of your InVentry equipment. The package will need to be signed for and safely retained within your organisation, ready for our installation engineer. If you would like the InVentry equipment to be shipped to a different location or to a different person, please can you let me by return email as soon as possible.



Should you have any queries please do not hesitate to get in contact.

Kind regards

Good morning,

thank you for offering to sort my computer log in, I was wondering if you
have had any response as unfortunately am yet to receive any correspondence
. If there is anybody I could contact I am happy to do so as I haven't
received anything as yet.

Currently I can not log on to a computer as my password is incorrect
or sign in to my google account.
again password is incorrect. Currently I can only access my emails on my
phone.


Many thanks

this is Andy Langhamer from Poppleton Ousebank, York. When using my
projector the projection onto the board is flashing and flickering, I

on its way out although I think it was recently replaced. Could you advise

Earlier in the week an issue was raised over the PC in Jenny Jackson's year
1 classroom going on and off the internet.  Someone came in to look and I
believe they just turned the ethernet cable around to see if that helped.

It hasn't because the connection into the PC wobbles, ie there is a problem
with the port rather than the cable.  Please could someone come back and
look at it?

Thank you

,T20230512.0089,CST Training Laptop (Service Number: dd1gsl3),"From Jane Lovejoy <j.lovejoy@ebor.academy>: Good afternoon,

Mateusz and Andy from Vital have just tried to look at this issue for me,
but they were unable to resolve it whilst visiting The Leyes Business and
Training Centre today, so they suggested raising a ticket.

Please could you amend the Wifi settings on the Ebor Training Laptop, so
that it does not automatically connect to the Ebor_Academy network
connection / it only connects to the Ebor_Training network connection?

The reason being is that my colleague, Wendy Harrington, noticed that she
was able to see some documents in 'Downloads' which were potentially of a
confidential nature when utilising the Ebor_Academy network connection;
however, these documents did not show / were not accessible when utilising
the Ebor Training network connection. Given some of our training
facilitators work outside the trust and use this laptop, we therefore want
to ensure that they can't access any documents via 'Downloads'.

Another issue which needs to be considered is that we cannot login into the
'rwteacher' user account without using the Ebor_Academy network connection
- this is the user account which the training facilitators are asked to use.

Hope this makes sense and please let me know if you require any further
information.

Best wishes,

I just wanted to confirm with you the date for the next ICDL exam.

This will be at 11am on Tuesday 23rd May.

Craig - please would you be able to provide IT help if needed?

Nicky/Gareth - please can you assign a diagnostic and exam (for Word) for
all Y11 students to complete?

They will be completing the diagnostic test prior to the exam. Tracey and
Collaine will be invigilating the exam like last time (at Arc).

For any students that were absent last time they don't need new
tests/diagnostics assigning as they won't have used the previous ones.

have any memory sticks / cards with around 8GB of memory?

Adam - can you let us know the size of all 30 videos in total? I'm guessing
it will be around the 8GB total. If not, I'll have to buy a 16BG (to be on
the safe side) memory stick from Amazon.

Lovely to hear from you. I'm sorry I'm speaking at a national conference on
Friday so I'm not at Manor and the students are having a cover teacher. I
am concerned that Luke is getting behind with his work (in all subjects) as
a result of his iPad not being properly set up. I don't fully understand
why Luke can't download GarageBand - it is a free app available for all
iPads. I've copied-in Ben and will ask him to contact you directly to help
to resolve this issue as a matter of urgency.

,T20230511.0163,2 X PCs & ipad not working,"Hi,

I spoke to Joe today about an old laptop that we were trying to get going -
it needed a bitlocker key and did eventually start switching on, but it was
taking ages so I think it's on its last legs.  Could someone have a look to
confirm that next time you're in school and get rid of it if there's
nothing we can do with it? It's in my office.

There's also another old laptop that's currently in Julie's desk (not being
used) in the main office, could you also have a look at that and get rid of
it if it's not usable.

Last question - one of the teacher's ipads has stopped working today - the
apps etc have all disappeared off of it.  Do you support the ipads and if
you do, can someone have a look at that please?  That's currently in my
office.

Many thanks,
Carrie

Please could someone have a look for me and reconnect them so the children

We still seem to be having a problem with the chromebooks and getting onto
the complete maths website.

Ghasson is saying that he has added the required domain to the filtering
system, but it still doesn't work.

With the new network you created for the chromebooks i've just had a look
at the IP address and it is different to the one Ghasson worked on as you
can see on the screenshot he sent.

Are you able to add the required domain to the filtering system for the new
chromebooks network or is this something Ghassan will be able to do?

Hope this makes sense.

Cheers,

Sam

,T20230511.0091,Projector in S12 not working,"Good morning,
I’m not sure whether I sent my original email (on 4.5) to the correct
address, so I thought I’d start again… My replacement projector is no
longer working - the indicator labelled ‘filter’ is flashing red and the
projector won’t turn on at all. Hopefully there is a very simple and
obvious thing that I am supposed to be doing but am not?
Thank you for your help,
Clare

Morning

L6 needs a check please when possible. We have lots of broken keyboards
again. Still have 2 PCS on central desk not working and third one in from
the door next to the purple display isn't working.

Note: The keyboards which were bought as replacements were extremely thin
plastic / low quality and not at all fit for purpose in a school where they
get heavy use. Something more durable needs to be bought.

I am struggling in some of the larger KS3 lessons.

I've been on Sims and checked all 3 Dollar students.  I think it was
parental responsibility that hadn't been checked.  They now show their

Joe had a look at my emails last week and said to leave it with him. I just
wondered if he had got any further as I still can’t access my emails on my
laptop and therefore also cannot log into things using google. I also don’t
seem to be able to access the google drive, it just doesn’t appear on my
list at all (don’t know if the two things are linked?)

In St George's RC (York) we had available, before, the ""Virtual
Experiments"" software available from the start menu under ""school software""
but Kevin Atkinson in Y3 and a couple of other members of staff have said
it is no longer there. There were (from memory) three separate versions
Y1&2, Y3&4 and Y5&6.

Please can this be installed (presumably on the network) for them to use it
again? There may be a copy of the software in the CD-Roms share; if not,
Kevin has the originals in y3, and he is usually in school
Mondays-Thursdays - I've also cc'd him on this in case you need to contact
him!

Thanks

Good Afternoon Kirsten,

As you may be aware, a request to integrate with your MIS has been made by
Seneca. Here at Wonde we are able to securely connect to your school MIS
(SIMS, RM Integris, ScholarPack etc) and ensure that the data will always
stay up to date within Seneca.

As you already have a Wonde connection, we have contacted your School
Portal account holder to ask them to approve access to the data required by
Seneca

Please let us know if you need any further information,

Kind regards

,T20230510.0249,School mobile phone connecting to school wifi,"Good afternoon,

I have connected our school mobile phone to our school wifi (as we're
trying to use it to access Tapestry in EYFS) but it is incredibly slow and
internet access just doesn't work. The only way I can make it work is to
disconnect from the school wifi and use a personal hotspot from my phone
which obviously isn't sustainable, do you have any ideas why this might be
a problem? We obviously attach all of our Chromebooks through the wifi and
do not have the same issue.

I have been just teaching in J07 and the computer was a nightmare.  It wouldn't let me open anything, so I couldn't access class charts for example.

Then eventually it let me open a power point , but then it froze and if I moved the mouse to click to present, it just beeped at me, and refused to let me do anything!

I gather another colleague of mine has had the same/similar issue today?

If you could wave our magic wand that would be fab!

Thanks

Abi

A week or so ago, someone came to look at the PCs in our Y5 and Y6
classrooms as they are painfully slow.
I understand these PCs are not on the managed service and I'm unsure why as
I thought all classroom PCs were and I think whoever came was going to ask
the question.
We have only had these computers since the new extension opened (so some
three years now).

Please can you let me know what we need to do to bring these PCs up to
speed.

,T20230510.0078,Microsoft accounts on a Mac,"Hi Rob

I need to use three Microsoft accounts - one for Ebor (although low
priority as it's mainly Google), one for Northern Lights Learning Trust and
one for Focus-trust.

I need to have emails open for Northern Lights and Focus-trust at all times
so I don't miss anything and to be able to join Teams meetings.

However, technical support at Northern Lights and at Focus-trust say it
can't be done. One suggests I keep one of them open via my Chrome browser
and then use the app for the other. I don't know how to use the app - it
keeps crashing.

Having a Mac is a further problem.

At the moment I have to switch between the two and inevitably I am missing
emails.

Can someone - possibly at Academia where they know more about Macs - help?

Thanks

Tim

On Thursday the students are doing 2 hours of prep with the teachers.  We
have then always printed the student's notes so that they can be given to
them the next morning in hard copy, however this year the teachers would
like the students to have them in electronic format on the exam account for
the next morning.  This will mean accessing the students' areas and
transferring these notes to the correct exam accounts on Thursday evening.
Please can this be done?

I have attached a seating plan showing which account relates to which
student for the Friday morning exam.

Many thanks,
Amy

We are receiving the following notification this morning when trying to
access the remote server link via our work laptops in order to access PS
Financials?

Please can this be actioned and resolved as a priority as we are working
towards meeting a monthend accounts deadline of friday.
This means that it is possible that we will require some out of standard
office hours access via the remote (eg 7am-7pm).

NB This wasn't an issue until around 6pm yesterday at least as I was using
the remote access with no problems up until then.

,T20230509.0126,Wifi Issues Hall,"Hi,
We need to have most of school working in the hall during SATs week and the
wifi in the hall is not coping with the amount of children using
chromebooks.  The wifi is not great in there on a normal day.
Is it possible to improve the wifi as a matter of urgency so children can
access their learning on chromebooks in the hall tomorrow?
Many thanks,
Bev

I'm getting reports from multiple departments that SIMS is running
incredibly slow.

I've just had to sit and wait 4 mins for Cover Manager to open (Usually
within 20 seconds).

Please could you have a quick look at the MIS and maybe even give it a
quick restart if necessary?


Thanks,

,T20230509.0043,Account for Jersie davis 19GRA-JD13 to 19GPS-JD13,"with have a student on a managed move to the school but she is not going of roll at grahams school but still needs to have account at gps.

Good afternoon,

NHA has just told me that Jersie Davis still doesn't have a school log in. Who do I need to contact to arrange for one? She can't do her coursework.

Thanks,
Nick
 is what i have been sent by the teacher when i checked ad there is no account for gps. 

so whizz kids is not creating the account when i asked about them being taken off gra roll they said it not going to happen and was explained to me that a second account should be created for her.

this is what i was told.

Hi Andrew,

As per our conversation earlier

There are different types of registration that need to be taken into account when creating accounts for students at each school.

Single Registration - This should create the account for a student as the student is registered only with this school
Dual Registration Main - This should create the account for this student as the student is registered with this school but could also be registered at another school in the area
Dual Registration Subsidiary - This should create the account for the student as they are registered with this school and although they may not attend all of their lessons at the school, they will need an account to access the school resources.
Guest Pupil - This does not normally need to create an account for the student. This scenario is likely to be the case if a student is attending a collaborative course at the school, but is not taking exams or registering on the AM/PM official register there or if the school is not receiving funding for this student

I understand that if a student is moving on a managed move between Trust school's this could cause a problem with the moving of the child's data between the schools, but a student cannot be without access to school systems and so if a second account needs to be created for this child with a different domain then this may need to be the case.

The litmus test for this would be if a student on a moved from our school to the school of a different trust on a managed move, there would be no delay in this student's account been created at the other school. We should follow the same process. A student must not be disadvantaged just because the managed move is within the same Trust

I hope this helps with your conversation that needs to be had with Vital

Kind Regards,

Mark Ward


so should i make a local account for this student but they are asking for an account asap

I would like to send a reminder to Saleh's former teachers about setting him work this week. I sent this out last week. The only thing is his timetable has changed and so when I look at the ""teachers of"" it seems to be the new list who haven't met him yet. Is there any easy way that I can email his former teachers again please?

Could you please have a look at it and fix it at your earliest convenience? In addition, the projector does a horrible loud noise all the time. Could you also please have a look at it?

At Scarcroft Primary School, we wish to encourage staff to have a healthy
work-life balance, and therefore we discourage the sending of emails
outside of the traditional working day. Where emails are received after
6pm, over the weekend or during a holiday period, it is likely that a
response will be given during the school’s normal working hours. Thank you
in advance for your understanding in helping us to promote a happy, healthy

,T20230505.0147,Re:,"Hi,

The problem is that audible will not sign in to student accounts because it
is blocked (as is Amazon on student laptops). The audible webpage needs to
be unblocked on student devices so that the password can work. When my
laptop was set as a Student, the same thing happened. It was only, when the
settings changed to staff, that I was able to log in.

If students' permissions cannot be changed to allow this, please could
English have some additional staff laptops in order to use audible that
way?

Thanks.

I also mentioned that Mateaus brought back to you 5 laptops for secure disposal and I asked for confirmation of disposal but have received nothing. Please could you via email at least just confirm you have disposed of them?

Written IT strategy and renewal plan in place?
Security programme and review management (provided by IT support) in place?
Documented programme for resolution of IT security issues?

Is digital data destruction managed and a policy in place? Please provide a copy if you have one.
Is IT security reviewed by governors/trustees?
Please provide dates.
Annual IT security audit?
Date of last audit.
Any accreditations? If so, what?
Specific insurance considered?

Do all devices with access to sensitive information have access controls configured?

Is autolock enabled? After how long?

My computer is in the attendance office at Aspire Academy main site.

When I have tried to log into the remote desktop it is coming up with this
error message ;

Sign in failed. Please check your username and password and try again.

I haven't changed my username or password and use this numerous times a
day. One of your advisors attended as he was already in the building. He
turned my computer off at the wall then turned it back on again which did
not fix the issue. He then told me 'sorry I can't help'. He said that he
had rang a colleague and that 'we don't deal with remote desktop'.

I asked the advisor what I should do about the issue and he said 'go and
tell the girls in the office'. I have been to tell the girls in the office
and we're all a little confused as to how they can resolve the issue? They
have advised me to log this with yourselves although one of your advisors
has told me that they are unable to help?

The advisors have now gone and I'm unable to log into sims.

,T20230505.0108,VYLHD - Impero Chromebook extension not working,"Hi guys,

Please can we get this sorted as soon as possible?

The impero chromebook extension still isn't working on chromebooks.

This could be an issue with the firewall rules or it could be the extension
needs to be pushed out/updated, I'm not sure.

At present, all windows devices are dialing back to impero, but the
chromebooks are not.

Best regards,
Lee

,T20230505.0104,PC Issues CO2/RO6,"Hi


Having a few issues with equipment in RO6 and CO2.


RO6: is very temperamental, issues with disk space, wouldn’t send to print until I restarted it yesterday, crashes a lot.


CO2: Had a few issues, lack of disk space, Office 365 not working. Today I tried to open a document on P Drive, message about disk space and then the wrong one opened (which was weird – like completely a completely random one form another folder), then when I tried to re-open from P Drive nothing would open (despite restarting). In the end I had to go in through the remote desktop to access my lesson. It also crashes a lot.


Very weird,  but also very disruptive for the lesson. Could you have a look into it please? I am getting the odd message on other PCs too, but more so these.


And….as I tried to send this email in outlook (following the link form the desktop) in CO2, it told me there wasn’t enough disk space to send so I had to copy onto this email and send from the office 365 version.


Thanks


Shane

Please could I request a new governor email address to be set up for
Rachael Lanzillotti at Manor CE Academy. Rachael will need to be added to

I've just turned the black box off, waited for the lights to go out and
switched it back on again but we are still getting the same 'All Lines are

Katie Chipchase had the same issue in my lesson yesterday and she had been
given a new password. I believe it was Wednesday ( and something after).

She is either fibbing ( although I have tried several times myself) or
there is something wrong with her log in setting.

We seem to be having issues with a google document.  It's one that is
shared by by Angela and I on a weekly basis.  Earlier today, I had the
document open and it looked fine.  Angela has since opened it and the
document has changed completely.  Some information is still there but lots
of text boxes are missing and some text boxes have gone behind each other.
(It's a word document)

I don't know a great deal about google docs and wondered if it was
something we were doing?

Hi Simon

Please can this be escalated to Vital (again!) as they still haven't got Jo
sorted with PSF and she has quite a backlog of work to get done.
If I send it to Vital helpdesk it still just goes to Lee at Graham School!

Hi Adam,

I'm unsure if you are the person to still contact, so please pass us onto whoever it is if needed. Hazel is still having issues with her laptop not syncing documents to the computer. She is having to email things to herself to be able to access them on the computer.

As she teaches across school, she does access lots of different computers. Could this be why it isn't working? We would appreciate some help. She has tried a few things you have sent but they haven't worked.

Look forward to hearing from you.

I was working on a document on Thursday 30th March entitled 'ASC Pack ER
March 2023' around 5pm. I am very confident that I saved the document just
before the computer ran out of battery and died. I cannot find the document
anywhere.  I spent a long time with a parent working on it and would be
devastated if we had to work on it again. It didn't even come up as a
recovered document.

Hope you can help.

Best wishes,

Stuart

If we could have the Trilby TV app downloaded onto the screen in the
canteen so that we can make use of the subscription we are paying for then
that would be great please. I have time today to set up the screen as there
are only Y11 on site. If it isn't possible to download then it can be run
from the browser but everything is locked out under the Students group and
so I can't do anything on the Chromium app which is on the TV either.

Kind regards,

We have noticed all our emails we are sending are going into the receivers

It happened a couple of times last week myself but I have been informed it
is also the same for the other teachers here. We are receiving quite a few
phone calls from people saying they have not  heard from us, then we ask
them to check and they have received the emails in their spam folder.

Is this something you can check for us please?

Many thanks,

Should Microsoft not receive your order within 30 days of this
notification, it will result in the termination of your agreement. In this
event, all Microsoft software covered under this agreement will need to be

Hi Clare,

Please can you contact Vital about the classroom computers? Can we get them
to check the age of them as well? Mine and Vicky's especially are
incredibly slow (mine is taking about 20 minutes to load up a set of slides
which is not ideal!).

Thank you!

Hi

Sorry I just wanted my phone line (ex 202) to be used as a phone line and the internet so I can plug my computer internet in as well as my phone so I don't have to use wifi on my computer - I think the lady misunderstood me when I called in.

,T20230428.0163,Sorting out EY user accounts in Fishergate,"Hello Vital,

I discovered, somewhat accidentally, that a LOT of the EY google accounts
in Fishergate are set up incorrectly.

We've had an ongoing issue with it over time, I think dating back to when
Matt asked for the synch to include the part-time N1 and N2 children - a
lot of children have been set up either without the leading cohort number
or with an incorrect one.

I'd like to try to sort this out (along with some other fishergate user
list issues) before the year-end, so we can hopefully start a new year with
the directory a bit less of a bomb site.

Having spoken to Sahar, the Early Years phase leader, she is perfectly
happy for the nursery children to be excluded from the automatic account
generation which I think may be the first step in avoiding future problems,
based on conversations I've ha with your helpdesk in the past.

Then I'd like to find and fix the incorrect accounts - there are children
in Reception with 21____ usernames, which is the format for the current
Y1s, I presume because they were created as if reception children when in
nursery or something similar.

There are other issues with the fishergate directory, but I'm trying to
start with one thing and work from there!

What's the best way to proceed, please?

Thanks
Kat

Hi Jonathan,



I know things are a bit tight at the moment, but I wondered if myself and Kelly could have an extra phone (and number) for our office. It's quite a pastoral role and we often need the phoe at the same time so sharing isn't really practical.



Thanks

,T20230428.0081,Re: Aspire Printing and exam Issues,"Good morning,

We do not currently have access to printing, copy or scan to email across
the academy site for all staff.

I have WJEC coursework which needs to be scanned into the exam boards which
I am unable to do with not having access to the scan and send function.

We currently cannot print at all, and this includes SIMS exams. I can
therefore not print any paperwork or candidate information for the exam on
Wednesday.

The student laptops have not arrived at site yet, I believe these need to
be reconfigured before the exam on Wednesday.

I have tried to add the Exam computer details on Trelson for the exam next
week and the first exam computer login has not been configured correctly so
I therefore cannot complete this task.

The English team has a coursework deadline and can not copy candidate work
before sending.

Due to the fact Monday is a bank holiday, I have grave concern with the
students' exam and coursework deadlines being missed.

Regards

Nikki

The website works on all microsoft devices such as the small laptops we

We have been in contact with cyc and they have opened up all the filters to
allow it to work but it still doesn't.

Is there anything you can advise us to do to sort this out?

,T20230426.0135,Fwd: SKE Training Records,"Good Afternoon,

I hope you are well. I appreciate you are incredibly busy at the moment,
but I was wondering whether you might be able to help? Dawn Chaplin from
Skelton Primary School is still unable to gain access to the server
following the cyber attack.

The training records for staff at Skelton, amongst other important
documents are stored on their server, rather than in a shared Google Drive.
We need access to these documents so that they can be
transferred across and stored securely. Without access to the training
records we are unable to confirm whether all staff have received up to date
statutory training/confirm any 'due dates' for training renewals. As such
we may be non-compliant.

Please could you advise whether someone would be able to look into this for
Dawn/Skelton and advise how long this will likely take to resolve? Any help
would be much appreciated.

Many Thanks

Lauren Oakes

Dear Stuart,

I think I may have made things worse yesterday by trying to log on to my email using Outlook.  I think that I have locked myself out of my account completely and I wasn't able to logon at all.

Do you want me to email the IT person directly to save you a job?

Many thanks,

Good afternoon
Many of you asked for a recording of the google drive training. Jake Reeves
Kemp has kindly provided a recorded whistle stop tour of the drive and how
it works which I hope you will find useful. Please click the links below to
the  training . As mentioned, if you have any further queries or want to
use Google in a different way, please contact Jake or me.

Each link lasts 30 minutes. The sound cuts off at the end of part 1 but
Jake has repeated this in part 2.
Google Workspace - Part 1

Google Workspace - Part 2

Thank you and enjoy!

I have tried switching the proxy off and back on as I've had that issue in

I had a thought over the weekend, as Debs has left her adobe will not be
used but we are paying for it. I don’t know how we do it but vital should
know how to transfer it to one of your team. I will leave it with you as to
who, but probably better for you or Ollie

Richard will come in at some point next week and we will need to give him
access to his folders whilst he is on site. I have said I will watch what
he accesses and approve what he can download and send to a personal email.
I will basically only allow stuff without any personal data on it and

Good morning Wendy,
I'm hoping you can help me with an issue. I have been in touch with both
Tim Jolly at Braeburn and Rob McKenzie at Vital York who suggest I contact
you as DPO for the trust.

I am formerly an employee of the trust having worked at Braeburn Primary
Academy as Head of School since it converted to academy status in 2018. I
took up a new post outside of the academy in Sept 2023 my contract with
Ebor having expired on 31st August 2023.

There is confidential information that Vital hold within my G drive which
is relevant to an ongoing complaint which Tim is dealing with at the moment
and which is inaccessible to him or I. Additionally, there is other
information which is relevant to my current role as Senior Lecturer at YSJ
University which is also on my G Drive and I didn't have the foresight or
time to take off prior to September.
Rob has suggested I contact yourself in the hope that we can arrange short
term access in order that this data can be retrieved from the archive.

I've cc'd Tim into this email for clarity. Look forward to hearing from
you.

Kind regards

Richard Crabtree

I think you make a compelling case Ian – Mike confirms here isn’t a way around it via the timetable so James can you plan in for the summer and just add to the managed contract.

I do think though it is worth going through the hardware on the contract at some point to ensure we need everything we are paying for. Sarah – is it worth putting an hour or so in the diary to go through?

Subject: P27 PCs Managed Service

Hi Jonathan

Our numbers for A Level Music Tech have been steadily increasing (brilliant!) but we've recruited 16 for Sept 23 - this is likely to be 17 now that an external student wants to switch from Music to Music Tech, with Music now not running in 23.

Great stuff for MT but our teaching space in P27/the studio only has 12 PCs in it - 11 student and 1 teacher. Although regular Music classroom P23 has 20 student PCs, timetabling always has MT on against GCSE or KS3 Music which means that P23 is just about always needed by other classes. The solution would be squeezing more PCs into P27 - we think 5 machines would cover us.

James came up to scope the space yesterday and we checked network ports and power points - both of which we seem to have plenty spare. James couldn't see a problem on those fronts. Space is the main issue so we are trailing some mini musical keyboards that are only as wide as a PC monitor screen (the existing keyboards are twice as wide and cause the space issue). Furnishing all PCs with these would allow us to squeeze in the 5 extra machines - we already have plenty of stools in there and luckily no legs on the desks to restrict seating.

James mentioned us possibly being able to get these extra PCs through the managed service, meaning no cost to the Music dept. We'd obviously cover the costs of music keyboards/audio interfaces/extra software licenses. The biggest need for this is the huge class of 17 we'll have in Y12 from September - we wouldn't be able to teach them in the existing space and don't have an alternative room - it'd be a mess for them. In a perfect world, we'd be able to have 2 groups of 8 but school can't afford that. Recruitment for MT does get stronger each year and the 2 GCSE groups of 2022-24 and secured 2 GCSE groups of 2023-25 will likely result in similar numbers for future MT cohorts. The extra PCs would not be left dormant after 2024. KS4 and 5 students often use P27 in study periods/P6 etc for coursework so the extra machines would help with that also.

Looking into future recruitment, we'll have to ensure a maximum number for the MT course as there is no more room for expansion - we'd have to cap it at 16 in future if we have these extra machines.

How does all of this sound?

Thanks
Ian

,T20230420.0151,ICDL drop down days - approved - 2/5 and 12/5,"Hi

I have just had confirmation that the ICDL drop down days that we requested
last term for the ARC students have been approved for the dates below. We
are now able to use the ARC as a satellite centre for these too:

- *Tuesday 2nd May*
*- Friday 12th May*

Tracey - please can you confirm if these work for you and the students? Are
you able to invigilate along with Tracy Tyler for the tests as Barrie will
be unable to do this as a teacher. If the strike goes ahead on 2nd May will
may need to reschedule this one I am guessing too...

Barrie if you could let exams know how many, for which students. and which
tests?

Exams, please can you assign diagnostics and tests for the Y11 students,
and also show the invigilators how to set up what they need to do too?

Craig, please are you OK to be on hand for IT support at the ARC on these
dates?

Hope this is okay

Any questions/issues, just let me know

Thanks

Hi Lewis

Re Jackie's email. The whiteboard pen in P08 has been missing for about 4
weeks (I emailed staff to see if anyone had picked it up in error but no
response). The computer in BO4 crashes regularly if using active studio
interactively.

Thanks

Steve

,T20230420.0015,Fishergate - issue with a staff iPad,"Hello Vital,


Josh Burnell in Y5/6 at Fishergate has been having trouble with an iPad - I
believe the Y5/6 staff one. It is completely out of space and generally
unhappy, so having deleted everything he could with no real improvement he
tried to reset it but was unable to because the reset email is apparently
Matt Snowden's, who is no longer at the school.


Are these staff iPads ones that you manage or are they standalone devices?
I don't know what the school/Matt procured exactly, although I believe they
did come from Vital. If they are managed, can you force a reset on them? If
not, we will presumably need to reinstate Matt's email address in order to
reset the iPad (and update the associated email address).


Any info you can provide appreciated,


Thanks

Kat

below) appears. Is there anything I can do from here, or is there a way you
can help out? We use SMART all day, every day!
Thanks,

Not sure if this is an additional install or I think it maybe just
an access security issue?
I know you solved it in the central team.

,T20230418.0258,Couple of ongoing problems in St George's York,"Hi

Several members of staff flagged me down today to say that the computer
times are still very inaccurate (and inconsistently so across the school),
and a nember of people are having problems with accessing youtube - either
getting a 'blocked' message from the filtering or (sometimes for the same
video in the same browser session) getting the video appearing to load but
then sitting there apparently buffering for an entire lesson.

It was reported affecting the pupils using chromebooks accessing the videos
on code studio (which are embedded, but hosted on youtube and which
normally work fine everywhere else) and on a wide range of videos for
several members of staff. This week it was reported in Reception, Y2 and Y6
but I know that it has also been a problem in all the other classes.

Both of these have been dragging on for a long time, and are actually a
real pain for the teachers!

Can someone take a look please?

Thanks
Kat

Today Alex Hinds came and visited us to tell us that he is seemingly having
google docs on his chromebook being blocked by smoothwall. He cannot access
the root page of google docs, but by going through google drive, we were
able to access some of them, however others were still being blocked,
seemingly at random. He's currently able to work around it by using another
site. This sounds a like a keyword filtering issue to me.

Hi Sarah,



I have sent an email from my drop box but thought I better send the link
over just in case.



Let me know when you have downloaded any that you want and then I will
close the file.



https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/xekawmw1syz7dmd2isedc/h?dl=0&rlkey=og3cgtt2y2p7nxc91fwrfi5pv



In case you haven’t seen my email – please do not share these with other
schools/establishments, instead direct them to our Vimeo channel. Also if
you need me to upload the resources also let me know, though I imagine you
can access these at home.



I haven’t added our earlier LGBTQ + videos but let me know if you would
like these also.



I will also send a resource overview out next week to all who have received
our training – look out for this as it will let you know topics covered and
direct you to attached resources.



Best,

Hi Sarah,



So good news, I can share the downloads of the videos with you 😊



I will set up a dropbox over the weekend so you can access them and save
them to your system. We just ask that you do not pass these on to any other
school (rather direct them to our channel). We have brand new videos and
resources being released after the holidays too (and they are fabulous I
have to say. I will send you a link to these also once they go live. Can I
just heck, are you able to access the resources just not the videos?



I have also seen that you might be interested in booking more work with us
– is this correct? If so feel free to let me know what you would like to
book and we can get that sorted.

Hi Sarah,



I will see what we can do for you. I might be able to add to my drop box
and send you a link so you can download them – or our digital team might
know a better way. I know we are planning to create a YouTube channel but
that doesn’t help for the hear and now. We are also adding 30 new vids and
15 resources (I think these might be our best yet) after the Easter
Holidays so want you to have access to these.



Best,



Lindsey

Hi Lindsey,



Our webguard is blocking the access to the vimeos and cannot unblock them
because it would open up Vimeo to all pupils etc....



Is there another way I can access the DRM videos?



Thanks,

Sarah

I am forwarding an email I have just received from Donna Murray at The

Donna should be able to access this directly from chrome rather than via
the remote desktop (although some schools have had to access chrome via
remote as it won't work directly for some reason).
Please can you provide assistance directly to Donna to ensure she is able
to access PSF Purchasing.

,T20230331.0038,Smoothwall issues on the chromebooks,"Hi Craig

Just a query - is there any chance the chromebooks can be looked at with
regards to smoothwall protection?

Liam Bone Jackson uses a chrome book as his main way of learning in class
and examinations. When trying to do his research for coursework he is
severely restricted on websites that he should have access too. This is
causing him anguish and slowing down his progress and completion of work.

Any suggestions would be greatly received.

,T20230323.0092,Exam Laptop Requests,"Hi,

I have been asked by the Head of Centre to liaise with Craig regarding the
email we sent about exam laptops


*As you are aware, we have a number of students who require the use of a
Word Processor for their exams.  Currently, this number stands at 16 and
could potentially rise over the next year.  Exams only have 7 laptops, one
of which is used in the Sports Hall to display the Exam Clock.
Additionally, these laptops are over 6 years old and are very slow, with
connectivity being one of the main issues.  Laptops take a long time to
load and can often crash.*

*Currently, we seat Word Processor students in their normal exam room with
access to a laptop.  This reduces the number of rooms being used and
therefore the number of staff we require.  *

*Back in 2020 we were bought around 15 additional laptops which were then
taken from us and distributed elsewhere.  Since then we have had a huge
reduction in IT Suites which has made arranging on-screen exams more
difficult.*

*Please can we request a set of laptops exclusively for exams use, i.e.
Word Processors, On-Screen Exams, Controlled Assessments, which will be
kept in the exams office and only used for exam purposes.  Obviously we
would not be able to allow these for general use, as they would need to
have the Exam Build installed and kept free from any damage or misuse.*

*The laptops don't need to be ""all singing, all dancing"" as they will only
be used for typing/research.  They do, however, need to be windows machines
as they need to have access to MS Word and we need the ability to disable
internet access through Impero.*

*Ideally, we would benefit from a class set (30-32) laptops in a trolley as
these can then be used for classes completing controlled assessments,
without the need to re-room classes timetabled to IT Suites.  With the
addition of Computer Science to the curriculum for the next academic year,
this will also be less disruptive to lessons that require access to IT.*

*If this is not possible, we are looking at needing 15 as a minimum for the
Summer Exams.*

,T20230313.0255,Re: Laser cutter software for G2- reminder- URGENT,"Hi can I please have an update on this please. I last contacted you on 22nd
February, see email below.

I now have 5 lessons to complete the coursework.

I have had no access to the laser cutter since January- the students have
had 18 hours without access to the PC- as the PC is the only method to use
the laser cutter software. The students have had to completely change the
method of manufacture and have completed all those changes in manufacture.
They still have two components to make and desperately require the use of
the laser cutter to complete these. There is no other method that will
work, we do not have belt sanders to complete a perfect circle stack in any
other way. The students have been severely affected by the lack of access
to CAM manufacturing equipment.

I have had to think very carefully how the students can possibly complete
the coursework without the laser cutter/belt sander and done as much as I
can, within exam board limitations and guidelines.

Thank you

Ed

,T20230309.0030,Google passwords,"Morning

As the Y9 pupils were instructed to change their google passwords after the
data breach, many are now struggling to remember these and we cannot change
them which is impacting on lessons.

Is there any way the IT teachers could be given permission to change the
Google passwords like we can the Windows ones? Or to sync them so if we
change the Windows one it changes the Google on also?

Thanks

,T20230306.0033,Projector and visualiser,"Hi Lee

We've been told as a department that we need to be prioritising use of
visualisers in lessons, ahead of Easter. My projector isn't high quality
enough to show my writing, so I struggle to use a visualiser.

Is there any way to improve my projector? I really don't want a TV screen
in my room, because I need to write with a board pen on the whiteboard.

Thanks,

Rosie

,T20230302.0175,Change keyboard language.,"Hi Kevin,
Sofi Gordienko Year 10 would like the option to change her keyboard
language to Russian. She works on 2nd CPU on left of room (from teacher
desk) in L16
This would really support her as an EAL student in her BTEC assessment

Do let me know if this is possible and how she can easily switch between
languages perhaps using 'settings' > 'time and language' > keyboard
language
