Hi Claire,

I can understand your frustration! I'm afraid we can't do anything on our end as it will be your school's firewall that is blocking the video, you will need to speak to your IT department about unblocking it.

the beginning of the holidays, Caroline Towler was struggling to gain
access to the account so the password was changed.  We need to ensure she

Microsoft Office Lens - saw this on first day of holidays. Looks great!

Maybe worth a 5 minute showcase before a staff meeting this term. Great for

Can we get Vital to download it onto school iPads?

queries;

I wondered if I would be able to have access to Office 365 through my
school email (cstevenson@ahs.pmat.academy) on my personal laptop- I am not
sure how to access this.

I have also just been told that I am missing a lead in my classroom (Ma5)

Any help would be appreciated.

Our printing is set up so that you have to release the printing from the
machine before it prints.  Usually we can see the names of all other school
staff who have sent something to  the printer as well as our own.  When I
print something now I can see a lot of other names as well, presumably from
elsewhere in Pathfinder as one is the Head of a different school and
another is on the central team.  I understand from a member of the central
team who happens to be in the building that this isn't normal.  Could you
please change it so we can only see school staff again.

Looking at the drives you access via file explorer rather than google

I need access to the Finance, HR and Clerking drives asap and I think there
was another shared one called Staff Shared.

Please would you also make sure that Jenny can access all these drives and
that Tamara Andrew can access the HR one.

I went down to 166MB of 117GB available on the Google Drive, which has
prevented me from saving any documents. I have since gone through all of my
folders and deleted all photos and videos stored in My Drive and on my
computer. This has left me with 1.45GB of 117GB left for the overall Google
Drive.

However, when I look at the properties just of My Drive, it is only 18.8GB.
I am not sure what else to remove/edit/change in order to free up more
space overall.
Is it possible to get some more storage as 1.45 GB won't be enough for this
year?

Good morning Stuart,
I hope that  you have had a good summer holiday.
Just to let you know that I seem to have problems login into Microsoft Teams.
I have attached the message I get when I try to log in.
Not sure what keychain password is.
I very much hope that you will be able to help.

Many thanks,

1. No Microsoft on the laptop - cant access Word/Excel etc.  Holly says I
need this added to my account and then she can talk me through how to
download it?

2. No Activ - can this also be added?

3. Lost access to S drive at New Earswick since logging in to this laptop.
As I'm continuing to support 1.5 days each week I will need access still.
 Can this be reinstated please?

I got a new phone over the summer and I'm just having an issue setting the
authenticator app up on it for 2 step verification. It's asking for a qr
code, but I can't seem to find it on my emails or find out where I can
access it on my google account. I've been able to access my emails by using
the app on my old phone for now, but going forward, I'd like to get it
sorted on my new phone.

Hope that makes sense?
You can call me if that's easier.
07837909183

Cheers
Jamie

[https://images.ecomm.microsoft.com/cdn/mediahandler/azure-emails-templates/production/shared/images/templates/shared/images/icons/status-alert.png] Alert for MountsBayAcademy.onmicrosoft.com
You’re receiving this email because we have detected a critical alert on one of your AadSyncService instances.

Title:
Synchronization has stopped for at least 24 hours.

Description:
Synchronization to Azure Active Directory appears to have been stopped for at least 24 hours. As a result, data in Azure AD may not be up-to-date.

Raised:
August 10, 2023 7:50 UTC

Server:
MountsBayAcademy.onmicrosoft.com

Service:

Tenant:
Mounts Bay Academy

Recommended action
There is a latency in processing this message for up to 24 hours, so you should verify the current state of your synchronization service. If synchronization is happening as expected, you can ignore this message.
Azure AD Connect synchronization scheduler might be unable to schedule the next sync cycle if Azure AD Connect Wizard is open in the background. It shares the same MUTEX with the scheduler. Make sure the Wizard is closed once any change is done.
Try to restart Microsoft Azure Active Directory Sync Services.
Any synchronization operations that are currently running will be interrupted. You can choose to perform below steps when no synchronization operation is in progress.
1. Click Start, click Run, type Services.msc, and then click OK.
2. Locate Microsoft Azure AD Sync, right-click it, and then click Restart.

Now that the internet issue has been resolved I have come into school to
work.

I have successfully logged in however the cut and paste feature is not
working from a word doc to the Trust finance system.  It does work within
emails however.

New display screens have been installed in my office and a new TV is
connected.

All of the customised settings that I had on google chrome have also
disappeared which included the websites I regularly used.

Any suggestions please?

,T20230822.0002,Handwriting font,"Morning,

I think Michelle Moneypenny may have already sent an email but I just
wanted to check.

It seems that a handwriting font hasn't been migrated over which means that
docs and SMART resources all need to be updated. I can't actually
remember the exact name of the handwriting programme but it started with an
""X"" on the drop down menu in fonts.

I am pretty sure the programme was a shortcut on most laptops too.

It would be great if this could be installed back on all laptops asap as
it's a font that teachers use to prepare lots of resources.

Many thanks

,T20230821.0113,Speakers in L8,"Hi Holly
Thanks. I agree they are working, the problem is the low volume.
The volume cannot go loud enough for students to hear clearly (they
frequently ask for it to be louder, and its not possible to do this). I
have diagnosed hearing loss myself and I find that the speakers are unable
to go to an appropriate volume as required. Other classrooms have speakers
which work really well, such as sc2, which I was in last academic year.

I know these speakers are working, however they are inneffective and will
negatively impact my ability to teach classes. Please they replaced with
more effective speakers such as those found in sc2? Thank you so much for
your time.

Kind Regards,
Charlotte

I spoke with somebody earlier regarding the broadband and internet issues
Clifton with Rawcliffe school are currently having.

Talk Straight have requested: that you reseat the cables going from the
router to the NTU?
Once this has been completed, if the connection remains down, please could
you provide us with photos of the router and NTU on site?

I believe the reseating of the cables already took place last week when one
of your technicians visited site?

I have also attached many photos Claire (Headteacher) took last week -
please could you advise which of these are the router and NTU?

Dear all,

Sorry to bother you over the holidays, but I just wondered if you could
help Iris with a wee problem? The classes for next year have been released
but Iris’s computer has broken with her Google classroom password saved on
it. Is there anyway one of you could very kindly help either send her
current password or send a password reset somehow? She feels v left out as
all her friends know which classes they are in next year and Iris is
desperate to know too and would be very grateful if you can help.

Iris’s login is:

21muinonen-martini@ahs.pmat.academy

Many thanks for your help and hope you are all enjoying your holidays!

The church that hire from us on Sundays were having issues opening their

microsoft powerpoint application in the search bar it doesnt seem to be
there. Believe this could be a permissions issue with the 'tsports'
account, as it's not working on my pc whilst my personal account is able to
access ppt fine.

,T20230817.0066,Pathfinder IT,"Hi Holly

Thank you very much for everything you have done to help us in Pathfinder!

to follow up what I said before, I am still having some issues with my left
screen - (told Kev about it back in May) which is intermittently refusing
to display fully and creating a black border (only on two sides of the
screen display - but means you can't use control buttons, drag the screen
contents to the right screen or see the navigation or close buttons if
displaying a web page or document?)  If there is any capacity to move me
across to 'replacement' monitors from BS1 great - if not, could you please
take a look at the left hand one - no idea what's wrong with it!

Alison (Bailey) is in today and has asked if it is possible to have a web
cam for her 2 screen set up (she sits directly opposite me).

It might be when Linsee is back in she decides she would like the 2 'big
monitors' that we gave to Liv, as she will be in more frequently than Liv
and she does more spreadsheet work - sorry if that means undoing anything
you have already done.  I'll talk to her when we get in in September rather
than put you to any extra trouble currently.

I am not in tomorrow so that would be a great day to do cabling.  Alison
has said it would be great if her mouse could reach further, likewise if
the two phones could have more 'give' in them to reach both desks that
would be great.

Really really appreciate everything you have done - thank you SO much!

Best wishes

Sorry to bother you with this - but I'm trying to access gov reports etc. I can't access my Teams account with this email address though, Password is not recognised. Is it possible to send me my password again or make a new one?? And I am assuming that the teams account is where all the gov reports are? Sorry to be useless.

Unfortunately, a member of staff at Cornwall Wildlife Trust was the victim of a phishing attack this morning, and the attacker then used the victims account to send out more phishing messages.  I’ve analysed the list and 77 of those emails went to Mounts Bay Academy so I thought I should contact you.



The details of the email are below, the infrastructure used by the attacker is flagged by Microsoft as being used for ‘Attacker in the Middle’ phishing, which is where the authentication by the victim is proxied by the attacker who can then steal authentication cookies, allowing them to bypass Multi-Factor Authentication.  If any of your accounts are compromised as well as revoking all existing login sessions and resetting the password, I would also check for recently added Multi-Factor methods, as those could be used to regain control of the account after the password is reset.



Email details

Sender: Lucy.Luck@cornwallwildlifetrust.org.uk

Subject: THE CORNWALL TRUST FOR NATURE CONSERVATION LIMITED

Date/time: 10th August 10:15am

Payload: an email attachment (EML file) links to a Word Online document which in turn links to a phishing URL (more details available if required).



Cheers

I understand that on August 11,  our old @stael.smccat.org.uk email
addresses were disabled. I think that linked to this email domain was our
access to the shared drives and now we (some or all) currently do not have
access to these files. Is it possible that you could reinstate this access
as a matter of urgency?

I believe that the drive was *G:\Shared drives\SAY - Staff Share (Old
Server)*

From here staff were able to access the sub folders.

Please ring me  on 07900255636 if you need to contact me.

Hi Ladies,

Just to confirm I've sent through the PO this week for Abby's laptop
(finally got the quote from Vital) I've asked Lewis to contact you directly
Abby when it is ready to collect - all I will need is the serial number
when you get it for our inventory.

Thanks so much,
Sarah

,T20230810.0111,Terrington Hall School - urgent request,"Hi

Further to my call, the office franking machine has lost connection to the server and their technical support have checked connections and tell me it is the school firewall. Their instructions are as follows:

Make an allowance for Port 443
Needs to be open for both in and outbound traffic
Allow URL UK-meterservices.neopost.com
If this is already laid out, may need to create a new rule

The franking machine is plugged into a new socket numbered 6 under the office window but Dave (site manager) has just been informed that this may not be even be connected yet. Please can you clarify.

I have 200 envelopes that the Headmaster wants in the post to parents today, so I would be grateful for your urgent attention.

Best wishes

What information will they need to see please? Is it just contact details,
or will it go beyond that? I will need to get a data sharing agreement in
place to ensure we remain compliant with GDPR regulations.

What we will then do is get them access to SIMS via the remote desktop so
they can use their own laptops and give them a generic account for SIMS
with access restricted to what they need to view.

Thanks

,T20230810.0019,VYLHD - Applocker issue,"Good morning all.

I need to have MuEditor & Bandlab Assistant working but due to the
Applocker GPO we have, I'm not able to get these to load.

The issue is that these two programs, run from the user\%appdata% part and
not from C:\Programs.

The way these two products work is annoying and there is no way to install
them to the C:\Programs section.

Is there any way we can edit the GPO to allow these two programs to run?

Unfortunately, I am unable to edit the Applocker Base Policy, so I am
unable to make changes and test this at present.

Best wishes,
Lee

They have asked us to request for the relevant ports to be opened on their firewall, so the dualcom can dial out on the internet.

Hi,



We have to re image the machines that have the software installed and relocate the software into a different IT Suite.







I have gone though to deactivate all the licences to allow me to re instate them on new machine where it will be required for the next educational year.







Can you please deactivate all the remaining licences for me so i can fully re apply the licences to new machines.







Thanks

Please could you check whether James is going to get that Chromebook with
the damaged port replaced as part of the managed service as I never heard
back from the previous email.

If you could also clarify how many Chromebooks you are due to replace as
part of the managed service that would be helpful too. I have put some of
our other ones in the Chromebook trolleys around school so there are more
than 30 currently in these.

Do you know if there are any issues to why I can't type a sender's email

  *   Please could you make sure Freemind is on the build for the new machines at least in R08 please, it should be now but often gets forgotten.
  *   Do you know when the pupils will be going into the Teams for next year? The teams are there but with no students so I can't prep my Class Notebook properly.

one have the Dexcom app installed on it and be linked to the wifi.

-The laptop which is broken and needs to be looked at, needs to be imaged?

Next year my teaching room will be RE6 and I have just been to log on in

to be plugged in and switched on but no power.
Also, would it be possible to upgrade the keyboard/screen in this room?
The keyboard is the old clunky key style and the screen is very small. I
know you will have a schedule for upgrading and it may not be Re6's turn
but thought I would ask.

,T20230719.0215,Computing Changes - Visit,"Hi,

In the holidays, I believe that you are doing some updates. Please could you clarify the questions below or I could ring up and speak to Adam if that is better as I know he has spoken with Linda. I would appreciate it if you could help with the second question as that is my biggest concern after my experience previously.

Do you need all iPads throughout school collecting for when you come in? As I thought these were updated remotely or is all the data getting wiped?

Would there be any chance that some of the laptops could be updated this Friday to Windows 11? As it would make it easier to see the difference for myself as many staff are worried that they will be losing data. I had some issues before when I recently moved to this new laptop with missing data so I don't really want to be leaving my laptop over the summer holidays to then come back to loads of stuff missing off it.

Are the computers going to a fully cloud based? So does that mean that there won't be anything backed up on a server so everything needs to be put on the cloud before staff hand in their laptops.

Thanks,
David

,T20230719.0212,Re: Computer screens,"I don't mind about the phone.
I do, however need two screens to timetable. At the moment, I'll be based
in Kirsty's office. Also, can the PC have SIMS, NOVA T6 and options
installed (it might be easier to move the PC and screens from Mike's
office into Kirsty's). I'll then need to move once Kirsty is back.
Thank you

,T20230523.0167,School app - Apple developer,"Hi there

Please can you let me know who mans the email address appledev@copmanthorpeprimary.co.uk?   Apparently an email has been sent to them to log in and renew the apple developer membership for our school app.

Thank you,

Kind regards
Clare

Hi there

Thanks for coming back to us.

I'm not sure who the appledev will go to - I'll check with IT!  Could the details be forwarded to this address please?

Thanks,

Kind regards
Clare

Hi Clare

Apple version
It looks like the school has not renewed its free Apple Developer membership (screenshot below). An email will have been sent to appledev@copmanthorpeprimary.co.uk<mailto:appledev@copmanthorpeprimary.co.uk> inviting you to login and renew. Until that's been done, Apple will hide your app.

<https://i.imgur.com/LjmebTT.png>Android version
We can still see the app in the version of Android we are using. However, it looks like the very latest version of Android does not support it. Let me investigate that and get back to you.

Kind regards

Graham

Hello there

We are still having problems with people downloading the app - both on iPhone and Android.

Apparently it doesn't show up in the app store on iPhone.

A parent has also sent in the below screenshot of their Android phone.

Is there anything we can do?

Hi there

Google were requesting some policy updates for the Android version of your app. I've completed these and have sent it for review. The review normally takes a few hours. Hopefully this will be sufficient to make the app available again, for now at least.

Kind regards

Graham

The Xerox follow me printer default paper size is letter paper, which I am
having to go in and change to A4 on every single print job I send through
or it doesn't print at all. Please can this be looked at? I'm not the only
