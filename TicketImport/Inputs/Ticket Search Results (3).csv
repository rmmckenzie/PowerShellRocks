,T20230131.0091,Wonde recovery & server queries,"Hi,

I have a couple of queries please.

Firstly, a few weeks ago we received an email from Wonde encouraging us to
sign up for their data recovery service (
https://www.wonde.com/data-recovery/ ); on clicking the link I saw it cost
£180 per year. Is this something that would genuinely help us, or is it the
case that we already have a sufficient solution in place with yourselves?

Secondly, our Trust's school improvement partner has a query relating to
our server ""approximately how old are your servers, when are they due (if
at all) replacement?""; according to my records we last replaced the server
in Summer 2018. I don't think we necessarily need new servers any time
soon, but if you have a rough idea on the answer to that, I will pass that
on.

Many thanks,

Hi Toni,

When I send anything for 'all' in my emails it doesn't send. I'm not sure if there is something wrong with my emails that block it. I can send individual emails to people.

Thanks,

Rebecca

Although my class computer is now connected to the network, it doesn't
connect to our new smart board. This might be because it needs a scart to
usb converter (or something along those lines!) - when Tom was in at the
beginning of term he said it needed this to connect but as the computer was
out of service at the time I didn't get it sorted. Apologies if it has been
connected since then (perhaps when it was connected to the network a couple
of weeks ago) but I can't seem to get it to connect to the board still - it
might be a configuration or settings issue that I don't know how to
resolve. Would somebody be able to help me with this please? My smart board
connects to the internet on its own so I can use it, but youtube won't work
on there and it is not very user friendly when using for teaching.

Thanks so much,

There is an issue with the geog laptops as Word/Powerpoint etc are not installed (I don't know if it is all of them, I assume it is) - I know it can be used online on 365 but it doesn't always work properly.  Also they don't seem to all be connected to the W14 printer which makes some lessons quite difficult.  Is it possible to get this sorted?

,T20230130.0019,Issues with wires connecting laptop to IWB,"Good morning,

There is a problem with both of the cables that connect my laptop to my IWB
(both the one that plugs into the USB and the one that goes in the HDMI).
It means that I can't move my laptop at all and the smallest movement or
knock means that everything disconnects. Even when everything is plugged
in, it leads to a problem with the sound, maybe as the HDMI cable is
cracked open too so that you can see inside.

Where can I get new cables from please?

Thank you,
Katie

Various members of staff have reported to me that they are having issues with the PC in reflection. It does appear to be running very slow and needs restarting to reset it sometimes. Also when logging out it has taken up to 10 minutes to return to the original logging in page.
Please could someone come and have a look at it.

Hi Sarah
Not sure if you can help with this 'glitch'
When I go to manage team for this group it shows no members but I know they are there as they have done assignments for me.
[cid:image001.png@01D9325B.323FE040]
If I try to 'add' them it says already there.
[cid:image002.png@01D9325B.62D0E3D0]
If I go through another route 'mange TEAMS' it shows that this group has students but if I click on the ...  icon to mange team I'm back to the issue showing no students
[cid:image003.png@01D9325B.DE1633B0]

Do you know why I can't see them?
I need to remove a student from the list
Thanks

I have found an old laptop that's never been used before but it must be

turning the CYC proxy off as that is the only way I can use the internet,
which I've been doing since summer. But this time whenever I try to save
any documents, word, SMART, anything it sends me an error message. Also, I
can't download anything from Google Drive or websites as it says
failed download.
This is really not ideal as I need my laptop this weekend to prepare for
Monday.
I have attached the message that it keeps giving me. I'm unsure why this
has happened as I haven't done anything differently.
Many thanks

,T20230126.0204,PMAT Phones,"Hi Joe,

I know Sarah has just been liaising with you regarding the phones (6003 and
6013). Currently, when somebody calls Angela's phone (6003), both hers and
Sarah's (6001) ring at the same time.

Please could this be set up as it previously was where 6003 rings
independently, and then if the call is not picked up after 5 rings, it
comes through to 6001 instead?

Hope this makes sense?

Many thanks,
Mia

I’ve just been informed that there appear to be a few more folders missing from the S drive.  It seems likely to have been Monday……as Hayden Gell seems to be missing since that day same as the one Mel informed you of Gracie Robinson.

The folders we know of so far are:

Gracie Robinson
Hayden Gell
Ruelle Carolan
Bailey Kelly-Harris
Brad Headington
Haiden Ward

Any help getting them restored would be really appreciated 😊

,T20230126.0077,Fwd: Don't miss your unsettled payment. Complete your debt payment now.," Forwarded message ---------
From: <stomlinson@archbishopholgates.org>

Subject: Don't miss your unsettled payment. Complete your debt payment now.
To: <stomlinson@archbishopholgates.org>


Hi there!

I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.
Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to
all your devices utilized for browsing internet.
Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on
continuous basis.

Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your
reference:
Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email
accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which can
arranged via internet).
Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
account (stomlinson@archbishopholgates.org).

Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.
Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).
Yeah, geniuses are among us.

Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and
others).
As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
browsing history and other types of data to my servers.
Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly
use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list
etc.
My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by
a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.

Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained
undetected until this very letter...

During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you,
I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites
hosting nasty adult content.
Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.
As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,
and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
scenes.

If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
make all those videos with everyone you know,
including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.
Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to
see.
I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched
videos,
(you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity
for you.

There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:
You make a transaction of $1370 USD to my account (an equivalent in
bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
funds transfer),
hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those
lustful videos without delay.
After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.
Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
worry about,
because I keep my word at all times.

That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
price,
taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close
monitoring during a long time frame.
If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with
bitcoins - everything is available online.

Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference:
1P5vLEEuGawo33WLs3pVdxTuyjqt7Ymf9C

All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened
(in other words 2 days).

The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:
> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return
address were created inside your inbox).
> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security
services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of
your friends.
 If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really
simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) -
 your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.
> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success.
Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.
> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw
them away. That won't solve the issue,
 since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote
servers.

Things that may be concerning you:
> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.
 Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
transfer is finished,
 I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done
by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as
TeamViewer).
> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed
money transfer to my wallet.
Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer
is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make
it happen way earlier!

We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!

In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need
to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events
anymore!
My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on
a regular basis.

,T20230126.0038,Problem with creating Google classrooms,"Hello Vital,

I've had the message below from Lauren Moss (cc'd on this email) at
Fishergate, who has recently returned to Year 1 following maternity leave.
I've pointed her at some people in school who may be co-teachers on any
existing Y1 classroom. If the classroom is under the maternity cover
teacher's account that may need restoring, I guess, to transfer ownership?
That was Yvonne Petruso.

Regarding being able to create a classroom, I checked and I also only have
the option to 'join' and not to create a Google classroom which is,  I
guess, the problem that Lauren is having.  As I understand it, this is
about membership of certain groups? Not sure what has changed, but Lauren
should be in the necessary security groups.

Thanks
Kat

"" Hi Kat,
So sorry. I can't seem to access google classroom as a teacher and I cannot
create a new google classroom for my current year 1s. Is this
because Yvonne has control?

Thanks,
Lauren""

Hi there!

I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.
Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to
all your devices utilized for browsing internet.
Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on
continuous basis.

Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your
reference:
Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email
accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which can
arranged via internet).
Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
account (sbattison@archbishopholgates.org).

Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.
Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).
Yeah, geniuses are among us.

Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and
others).
As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
browsing history and other types of data to my servers.
Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly
use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list
etc.
My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by
a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.

Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained
undetected until this very letter...

During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you,
I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites
hosting nasty adult content.
Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.
As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,
and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
scenes.

If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
make all those videos with everyone you know,
including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.
Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to
see.
I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched
videos,
(you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity
for you.

There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:
You make a transaction of $1370 USD to my account (an equivalent in
bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
funds transfer),
hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those
lustful videos without delay.
After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.
Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
worry about,
because I keep my word at all times.

That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
price,
taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close
monitoring during a long time frame.
If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with
bitcoins - everything is available online.

Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference:
1P5vLEEuGawo33WLs3pVdxTuyjqt7Ymf9C

All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened
(in other words 2 days).

The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:
> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return
address were created inside your inbox).
> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security
services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of
your friends.
 If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really
simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) -
 your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.
> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success.
Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.
> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw
them away. That won't solve the issue,
 since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote
servers.

Things that may be concerning you:
> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.
 Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
transfer is finished,
 I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done
by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as
TeamViewer).
> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed
money transfer to my wallet.
Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer
is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make
it happen way earlier!

We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!

In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need
to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events
anymore!
My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on
a regular basis.

Hi,


The  Maths watch homework set last week and due on Tues 24 Jan by 10pm is
either incomplete ( less than 50%) or not attempted so I have had a chat
with them and extended it until tonight at 10 pm as some have said they had
forgotten/ couldnt access computers etc. As I have explained we have chrome
books, teachers available to assist during lunchtime etc as well as after
school availability to help.


If the work is not completed to a min of 50% by tonight at 10pm then they
will have a lunchtime detention either Thurs or Friday lunchtime.



thanks  f.sanderson

In order for me to put some instructions together for logging on externally, I need the children's email addresses - please can you give me a list of addresses for the children in Year 3 and 4?

Last week I requested that access was given to supply teachers to access
the staff shared drive on the server.
I can see that when logged on supply teachers can access Staff Shared
'Documents'.
However, they need access to the whole drive so that our staff can put work
in a folder to leave for the supply teacher.
Or is there a different way that this can happen?
At the moment, our teachers have to leave their GDrive details for the
supply teacher which isn't secure.

,T20230125.0086,Fwd: Don't miss your unsettled payment. Complete your debt payment now.," Forwarded message ---------
From: <mholmes@archbishopholgates.org>
Date: Wed, 25 Jan 2023 at 11:12
Subject: Don't miss your unsettled payment. Complete your debt payment now.
To: <mholmes@archbishopholgates.org>


Hi there!

I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.
Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to
all your devices utilized for browsing internet.
Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on
continuous basis.

Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your
reference:
Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email
accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which can
arranged via internet).
Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
account (mholmes@archbishopholgates.org).

Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.
Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).
Yeah, geniuses are among us.

Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and
others).
As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
browsing history and other types of data to my servers.
Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly
use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list
etc.
My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by
a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.

Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained
undetected until this very letter...

During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you,
I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites
hosting nasty adult content.
Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.
As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,
and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
scenes.

If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
make all those videos with everyone you know,
including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.
Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to
see.
I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched
videos,
(you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity
for you.

There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:
You make a transaction of $1370 USD to my account (an equivalent in
bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
funds transfer),
hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those
lustful videos without delay.
After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.
Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
worry about,
because I keep my word at all times.

That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
price,
taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close
monitoring during a long time frame.
If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with
bitcoins - everything is available online.

Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference:
1P5vLEEuGawo33WLs3pVdxTuyjqt7Ymf9C

All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened
(in other words 2 days).

The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:
> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return
address were created inside your inbox).
> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security
services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of
your friends.
 If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really
simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) -
 your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.
> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success.
Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.
> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw
them away. That won't solve the issue,
 since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote
servers.

Things that may be concerning you:
> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.
 Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
transfer is finished,
 I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done
by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as
TeamViewer).
> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed
money transfer to my wallet.
Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer
is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make
it happen way earlier!

We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!

In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need
to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events
anymore!
My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on
a regular basis.

continuous basis.

Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your
reference:
Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email
accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which can
arranged via internet).
Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
account (kleplatre@archbishopholgates.org).

Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.
Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).
Yeah, geniuses are among us.

Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and
others).
As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
browsing history and other types of data to my servers.
Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly
use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list
etc.
My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by
a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.

Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained
undetected until this very letter...

During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you,
I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites
hosting nasty adult content.
Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.
As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,
and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
scenes.

If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
make all those videos with everyone you know,
including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.
Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to
see.
I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched
videos,
(you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity
for you.

There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:
You make a transaction of $1370 USD to my account (an equivalent in
bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
funds transfer),
hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those
lustful videos without delay.
After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.
Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
worry about,
because I keep my word at all times.

That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
price,
taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close
monitoring during a long time frame.
If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with
bitcoins - everything is available online.

Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference:
1P5vLEEuGawo33WLs3pVdxTuyjqt7Ymf9C

All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened
(in other words 2 days).

The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:
> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return
address were created inside your inbox).
> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security
services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of
your friends.
 If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really
simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) -
 your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.
> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success.
Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.
> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw
them away. That won't solve the issue,
 since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote
servers.

Things that may be concerning you:
> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.
 Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
transfer is finished,
 I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done
by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as
TeamViewer).
> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed
money transfer to my wallet.
Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer
is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make
it happen way earlier!

We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!

In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need
to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events
anymore!
My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on
a regular basis.

Our InVentry system has completely stopped working, so we are due to go
ahead with a refresh of the system, but they require an IT support
technician to be available in order to assist the engineer, please see
email thread.

Would someone be able to assist the engineer on this date?

If you could confirm this as soon as possible, then that would be much
appreciated.

Morning Chloe,

Many thanks for getting in touch about the InVentry, we should be fine to
go ahead with the refresh on 03/02/2023.

I will contact our IT provider Vital today and double check their
availability for this date, but I'm sure they will be able to accommodate.

It is fine for the engineer to use our car park, and I will familiarise
myself with the refresh preparation document and let you know if I have any
questions regarding this.

Hi there!

I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.
Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to
all your devices utilized for browsing internet.
Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on
continuous basis.

Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your
reference:
Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email
accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which can
arranged via internet).
Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
account (dsheridan@archbishopholgates.org).

Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.
Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).
Yeah, geniuses are among us.

Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and
others).
As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
browsing history and other types of data to my servers.
Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly
use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list
etc.
My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by
a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.

Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained
undetected until this very letter...

During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you,
I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites
hosting nasty adult content.
Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.
As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,
and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
scenes.

If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
make all those videos with everyone you know,
including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.
Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to
see.
I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched
videos,
(you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity
for you.

There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:
You make a transaction of $1370 USD to my account (an equivalent in
bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
funds transfer),
hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those
lustful videos without delay.
After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.
Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
worry about,
because I keep my word at all times.

That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
price,
taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close
monitoring during a long time frame.
If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with
bitcoins - everything is available online.

Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference:
1P5vLEEuGawo33WLs3pVdxTuyjqt7Ymf9C

All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened
(in other words 2 days).

The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:
> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return
address were created inside your inbox).
> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security
services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of
your friends.
 If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really
simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) -
 your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.
> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success.
Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.
> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw
them away. That won't solve the issue,
 since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote
servers.

Things that may be concerning you:
> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.
 Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
transfer is finished,
 I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done
by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as
TeamViewer).
> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed
money transfer to my wallet.
Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer
is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make
it happen way earlier!

We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!

In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need
to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events
anymore!
My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on
a regular basis.

I think Oliver emailed in yesterday about the booster to the hall for the
wifi.  It has failed - the thing that is a white disk on the wall by the
hall door is not glowing blue so it definitely needs replacing
immediately.  We cannot access wifi in the school hall which is an
urgent problem.

Also I need logins for 3 new pupils:

Ibrahim Khwajeh (Year 3)
Yousef Khwajeh (Year 5)
Isa Khwajeh (Year R)

Hi Rebecca

Hope you are well.

Thank you for your purchase of a system refresh.

Please review the attached system refresh preparation document, as this
provides important information about refreshing your InVentry hardware.

Our next available date for your refresh is* 09/02/2023**. *I have reserved
this date for you until* close of business today (24/01/2023)*. If you
could confirm suitability as soon as possible, it would be greatly
appreciated. If we haven’t received confirmation by this date, the
reservation will be removed and we will need to arrange a new date.

We do require your IT support technician to be available to assist the
engineer with network ports/network IP addresses, testing the backup,
testing the MIS, installing Anti-Virus and adding the InVentry admin
software to the various computers.

*Your system will be down whilst the upgrade is taking place. You will need
to have alternative methods in place for signing in and out. *

*We recommend using a paper list to record visitors, staff and pupils
signing in/out and our engineer will be able to add this information into
the newly update Inventry software when the refresh is complete.*

Due to having to carry heavy tools and equipment, we kindly ask if our
engineer can park within your onsite car park. If this is not possible,
please could you advise on nearby parking facilities that our engineer can
use.



Your InVentry equipment is going to be shipped directly to your site before
your installation. It will be directed to the address provided on your
order - this will be marked for your attention. The package will be shipped
in a large, reinforced cardboard box, which will be clearly labelled with
‘InVentry’. This box should only be opened by your InVentry engineer,
otherwise it could void the warranty of your InVentry equipment. The
package will need to be signed for and safely retained within your
organisation, ready for our installation engineer. If you would like the
InVentry equipment to be shipped to a different location or to a different
person, please can you let me by return email as soon as possible.



In the meantime, if you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact
me or one of my colleagues within the scheduling team.

Kind regards

I have just checked with IT and this does mean Y8 students cannot
access
their accounts too.

Please would it be okay to let me know when resolved as at the
moment
students cannot complete their planned learning.

Thanks

understand if this is not possible in the current circumstances. I have

Please can I request some changes to access for network folders at Braeburn?

Laura Exton - needs access to the SBP folder on the photocopiers & O drive
to scan and access documents in the folder on the O drive

Lacie Hawes - needs access to the Senco folder on the photocopiers & O
drive to scan and access documents in the folder on the O drive

Melanie Watson -  needs access to the Child Protection folder on the
photocopiers & O drive to scan and access documents in the folder on the O
drive

Also, I have been granted delegated access to Alison Mathewson's emails,
whom I have just taken over from as School Business Partner.  I am hoping
there is a way of accessing her Google Drive documents / folders as there
are currently documents I cannot locate, which I expect will be stored on
her drive.

Thanks in advance

That is not a domain that I recognise and I don't think that it is one that
we are using. It's not listed on either our Google or Microsoft accounts.

As I don't think it is being used I don't think we need to do anything.

Further to our conversation, it would be great if we could get two of the

The one beside the printer is Lauren's personal workspace as she has no

Please would it be possible for Vital to be able to download one of these
for us? Abi Hall is coming soon so that we can adapt the NFER tests for
Edward Tones. This is what she has asked for:

Please could you make sure you have access to a pdf converter – these are
available for free online and VITAL will be able to download one for you
(pdf.small and pdf.sam are meant to be good).

Hi

We have noticed that we in the office can no longer hear the bell for the
end of lessons or the end of the day.  Is the bell still working through
school?  If so, please could someone look into why we no longer hear it,
and then rectify that for us please?  I know we stopped being able to hear
it in The Hub a while ago too.

Angie,



I have attached a couple of presentations for my talk in assembly. I would
like to include child exploitation at some point but that would be an
assembly of its own as I would like to show them Alfie story it may be
something school do.



Would it be possible to use these on a powerpoint for the talk?

outside of the traditional working day. Where emails are received after
6pm, over the weekend or during a holiday period, it is likely that a

Hi Russ

Hope you are well, just to let you know ERYC have upgraded the onsite router and installed an onsite smoothwall filter to improve internet connectivity at both the Junior and Infant sites ( Hessle ).
To ensure the chrome devices have access to the internet, could you ensure the IP addresses are changed as below before the end of the week:

All Saints Infants = 10.171.140.20 port 8080(pupils) 9090(staff)
All Saints Juniors = 10.171.142.20 port 8080(pupils) 9090(staff)

Hi Tim



Thanks, Monday 6th February – day before Safer Internet Day (good option)
is booked.  Excellent work.



Might also be worth getting StreamYard unblocked if is, this is the guest
virtual studio product I use, it has better audio quality than Zoom or
Teams or Google.  Is all the firewall filtering done centrally for all of
the Schools?



Please let Justin know we’re good to go.



Many thanks

Please can each school suggest two dates in the next month or so (or when
convenient) when you would like to run the day. Russell (copied in) can be
contacted directly if you have questions.



There will be six separate sessions, on different days. As we only have
the one professional microphone, arrangements will need to be made to get
it from school to school.



Russell will be billing the trust centrally and these costs will then be
passed back to the schools internally.



Hope this is OK!



Thanks

Hi Kerry,

Sorry to come back to you with this: Anya STILL cannot access her laptop on
her sign in or her gmail (sign in has been provided but doesn't work).

Angie still cannot access Microsoft Office on her machine, nor can she
access YouTube.

I have tried ringing Vital as you suggested and they just said they would
ring back (and didn't).

When you're in the school tomorrow, would you mind chasing these items for
me?

Let me know what you think.

,T20230123.0168,staff using their own laptop for prininting,"Hi,

staff print via printix using school devices (pc / laptop).

Would this work for a teacher's personal laptop?
e.g. if they login to chrome with their teacher@stp.smccat.org.uk account
will the printix client get pushed out ? Or is that only for school
owned devices ?

If it's not pushed, could a teacher manually download / install printix on
their own laptop
and then login with their school account to enable printing ?

I guess I could manually add the printer on the personal laptop if printix
isn't an option.

thanks

and keeps repeating until you press e.g. escape.

against this and the label can be updated should any not function and need
to be removed.

Sadly we have just printed a whole forms reports on standard default black

This has caused a massive amount of waste in time, paper and ink, and
without confidential waste bags, causes unnecessary time wasting at the
shredder also.

We would really appreciate this being moved up your 'To Do' list.

Hi Kevin,
Thanks for setting us up with the three Default settings.
We are still having issues with it refreshing the default though. Joanne
set up the default as and has been printing happily to Exams Interim, but
it has just reverted to Exams (black & white) for the last few documents.

Were you able to stop the refresh for us?

,T20230123.0133,Office PC modified to use like a Chromebook,"Hi,

My office PC hasn't been changed yet so I can use it like a Chromebook (for
want of a better description!) My office is on the first floor opposite
room 118.

I'm fine with my Chromebook for now but next Monday (30th Jan) I'm starting
some remote training which I will need my double screen for. Is there any
chance my PC can be adapted before then so that I can complete this
training in my office? I'm trying to complete the training on the building
to minimise the requirement for cover over the 2 weeks as it's only half
days at a time.

Thanks,

Emma

We've got a chromebook that is having issues with the internet. It is
intermittent, but when its happening, Chrome connectivity diagnostics
reports that Port 80 and 443 are inaccessible (I can provide the logs from
the test if you need them). I've tried powerwashing the chromebook but it
doesn't seem to have fixed the issue as we couldn't even get past
enrollment without issues connecting. I've had a look online, and it seems
to be a fairly common issue, but I couldn't find a solution that seemed
relevant to our setup! The Chromebook's SSN is 5CD050288.

Hi both,

The year 6 common room is now going to be used (pretty much) as a classroom
again and I think that the board has a loose connection/faulty wire. The
screen keeps going blank, then reads 'connecting' and then manages to
re-connect itself. If we could ask Vital to have a look at this ASAP, that
would be much appreciated.

Thank you so much,

Charlotte

This is just a quick e-mail about the logins for Year 1.

I've noticed that, for Year 1H, two of the boys have the same log in as
they are both called Thomas and their surnames both begin with H.

Could this be amended please.

Also, I'm aware that some of the children have changed their password from
redredred to something else - certainly Esme Clovis-Scurr has!  I was also
wondering if all passwords could be changed back to redredred please.

Thank you so much.

We have a Team called peripatetic lessons. It is set up for guest peri teachers (flute, piano, etc teachers) who do not work directly for the school to be able to access a shared area for their weekly pupil lessons. Seems some ‘guests’ can access, and others get kickback. See below for one with problems. Another is ‘Lindita Simaku’. Can you please explore what is wrong with our Teams guest access provision and advise?

cc Claire,

Unfortunately I am unable to access the below.  When I tried, it eventually came up with this error message.  Each time I click on it, it keeps just showing the same message (see below).

I have attached my timetable for next week in Excel format.  If one of you could kindly copy this into the master spreadsheet, I would be most grateful.

Hi,
can you unzip this evidence file.  It was all of the evidence we uploaded  
for the careers quality mark.  With all of our servers locked off I figured  
I would download it back so that I had some of my documents back...but I  
can't figure this bit out.
thanks
Emma

An update on the password reset issue:
More and more Macs are now not letting students reset their passwords -
there is no pattern in terms of locality of the Mac within the room, it
just seems to be widespread.

We need this sorted ASAP - it affects everything; GCSE and A-Level
coursework, KS3 topics, Arts Award coursework... it completely derails the
lessons and is seriously affecting student progress, engagement and
behaviour.

Please keep me updated as to when Vital can seriously get this looked into

I got this email from Emma Dinsdale yesterday and I had a look this morning, it seems as if Laura can override timetabled rooms, or that they are not showing, would you be able to do some investigating and see if you can see what is a miss? Normally no booking can be over ridden without asking the original booking and timetabled ones can't be moved.
Thanks
Sarah

I think there is something wrong with the room booking system? Looking at it, rooms appear to be available but they're not. I am timetabled to be in here P2-4 but those are not showing. It has moved Laura in here p4 but she thinks she booked a different one- it isn't showing. I thought it was W08? Tomorrow looks to be doing the same thing?

Hi,

I hope you are ok. Please could you pass on my query to ICT support?
My whiteboard is no longer interactive. Is there anything I can try doing
myself to get it to work? Everything is connected. I am in school today but
only until 12. I am in full days Mon-Wed if next week is more realistic.
Many thanks

Hi Chris

The software is installed on all the PCs (except the one without a keyboard, I'll drop one off this aft and get it installed)

The focusrite software immediately detected the box and interacted with each other fine, but I don't know how to link Cubase up/test with Cubase, especially as I didn't have any input devices. If you're able to give it a test when you're next available that would be appreciated, and I'm happy to come down if you have any problems during testing

Thanks

Hi Lewis,

The year 11s have informed me that the focusrite audio interfaces aren't working in the practice room anymore - drivers perhaps? Please can you take a look ASAP as they work in there on their coursework so could do with it working.

Thanks,

Please can you contact Vital and ask them to remove WPS from my computer if possible and/or make Microsoft Office my default programme. I've managed to download it whilst trying to open the returned ILP from Mrs W-C but I can't blooming remove it!

Can you also ask them to add Let's View to Mike's login.

Hi Lucy,



I have been looking into the issue with sending your reports, there is an issue with the email account papercut is using to send out via papercut@westfieldprimary.co.uk<mailto:papercut@westfieldprimary.co.uk>



Would it be possible to speak to your IT or to who administers your email accounts.

Looks like the connect.ini file on the InVentry machine is wrong, it is incorrectly trying to redirect through a mapped drive with the letter S:


Could you please replace the connect.ini file in C:\Program Files(x86)\SIMS\SIMS.Net  with the attached correct connect.ini file, SIMS should then work on the InVentry machine.


Could you also please send us the name/IP of the InVentry machine for our reference.

Hi Mel,

The new links were installed by the electrical firm not a Vital York 3rd party contractor.
All links are up for the internal computing network.

The CCTV and Paxton run from a different system, they use separate cabling (I made sure on the specs there was spare fibre/data installed to cover this)

If you can email a support request into help@vitalyork.com<mailto:help@vitalyork.com>, the next time Marcus is passing onsite, he will have a look, however we don’t support there systems so would be reluctant to do too much in case we make something worse!

Morning Melanie,

When the install team were on site installing the access control to the site, Vital provided them with a fibre link from the studio back to the pupil support building. The access control was fully operational, but before Christmas the ethernet/ fibre link to the studio has been disconnected, meaning you are unable to control, program or receive any data back from the Paxton access control system . Unfortunately, we are reliant on vital to provide the link required.

Since the installation we are still waiting for the CCtv fibre link to be completed by vital, Currently the CCtv camera on the studio cannot be used. I spoke to a vital technician who was onsite nearing the end of the project, he was amendment the link was nothing to do with them, at the time Pat Dalby, my Engineering Director, and MD were onsite who all agreed that vital were providing all the links, and switches. Vital had provided the networking equipment throughout the upgrade project. As we were nearing the end of the project, we have provided the poe switch with is in the studio’s server cabinet, the poe switch has 2 x gigabit fibre optical ports.

If it could be possible to arrange with Vital to reinstate the access control fibre link between the studio and pupil support building. Then complete a new fibre link for the CCtv camera form the studio to the pupil support building.

Mark

I have checked class charts and there is an account in there, however, I
have copied in Dan Furniss as I am not sure how to set permissions for the
ITT placements, which on this occasion will need to be completed manually
so we must wait for Dan.

Many thanks

Hi Adam,
Sorry to bother you, I know you're busy.
We're wanting to set up Adobe Express for Education. There's a form for us to fill out, but it also says that we need to let our IT provider know, and within 48 hours of getting the account set up, they will send an Admin Console to the IT Admin contact - I assume this is you? Is this something I'm ok to go ahead with?
I'll wait until you get back to me before I go ahead.
Thanks Adam,

Morning Ralph,
There seems to be an issue with my Class Charts login. When attempting to
login it says:
""we found your account, however it has either not been enabled or has been
archived. please contact your Class Charts administrator""

Im assuming it just hasn't been enabled, but as a result i wont be able to
load registers until resolved.
If there's anything i can do with regards to resolving this and who to
contact please let me know.

many thanks

Please could you ok this so that I can make and print labels off? I usually

Voicemail messages to phone 3355 sound very garbled, very difficult or
impossible to understand

However if they speak to someone directly the sound is absolutely fine, so
that suggests to me an issue with the voicemail itself and not the handset?

I hate to pester, but I still can't access the data side of the Modern Languages P drive area. I've never had this issue before, so it looks like some access permissions have changed in one of the updates. I'm copying the pop-up error message below for info. We need to download GCSE mock speaking exam audio files, so if you could possibly prioritise this, it would be much appreciated.

Hi Emma,



I do not know which laser software you use, but the answer is probably no,
unfortunately. The software is Windows-based. I do not believe that it is
compatible with ChromeOS.

Morning.

Our school IT has been hacked and we are wanting to lasercut using a
chromebook while the school sorts the IT issues as we are currently not
allowed to turn on any PC.

Is there a cloud version of the laser softwear you would recommend?

Hi Tina

Following on from our telephone conversation.

I can now confirm that everything is in place to complete your InVentry
system refresh on *18/01/2023**.*

Your engineer is called *Alex Pearson* and will arrive at site between
* 11:00 *and *13:00* to complete your refresh.

Please could you make sure that everything is in place ready for the
engineer to complete the site visit. If there are any issues that arise
outside of InVentry’s control, a chargeable return visit maybe required.

Just a reminder that we do require your IT support technician to assist the
engineer with network ports/network IP addresses. This can be remote or
onsite support.

*PLEASE NOTE: Your system will be down whilst the upgrade is taking place.
You will need to have alternative methods in place for signing in and
out. We recommend using a paper list to record Visitor, Staff and Pupil
Sign In's/ Out's and our engineer will be able to add all of this
information into the newly update Inventry software when the refresh is
complete.*

Due to having to carry heavy tools and equipment, we kindly ask if our
engineer can park within your onsite car park. If this is not possible,
please could you advise on nearby parking facilities that our engineer can
use.



Your InVentry equipment is going to be shipped directly to your before your
installation. It will be directed to the address provided on your order -
this will be marked for your attention. The package will be shipped in a
large, reinforced cardboard box, which will be clearly labelled with
‘InVentry’. This box should only be opened by your InVentry engineer,
otherwise it could void the warranty of your InVentry equipment. The
package will need to be signed for and safely retained within your
organisation, ready for our installation engineer. If you would like the
InVentry equipment to be shipped to a different location or to a different
person, please can you let me by return email as soon as possible.

In the meantime, if you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact
me or one of my colleagues within the scheduling team.

Kind regards

Good morning,

Please can you help, Neil is taking some time of absence for Dependant care leave, Lisa Brett is taking over his role and acting up as Head.

We still want Neil to have access to his emails but also it would be good if emails are diverted to Lisa so that nothing is missed.

How can we go about this? We would also like a message sending from Neils email, but I will send you what the message should say.

Good morning everyone,

Please note that we have a new relief cleaner who has started with us this morning, Ms Tracey Hicks. She will be covering Teresa's absence while she is on long term sick.
Emma S please can you update the staff list on the website.
Emma H please can you add Tracey on to the Bromcom Staff Record
Lewis please can Tracey be given a staff email and school IT account
Chris, please can Tracey be set up with a Smartlog Account. I have an induction pack ready to give her on Monday and we will need to find some time for her to watch the NPCAT safeguarding videos.
Ruth, once Tracey's DBS comes back please can you create her a staff lanyard and let me know once she has one.


Kind regards,

Also - have the refreshments been confirmed?

The phone in 218 is still not connected ( I believe it was disconnected
when the computers were) and I can't work out how to do it.

Also I seem unable to get sound from my projector if someone could come and
have a look. I am sure it is an easy fix but I am not sure how to do
either.

Thank you,

Hello Miss Dowlen,

I know you you will be unable to help as it’s the weekend but Theas Google
classroom password isn’t working. It was reset by Miss McDonald last week
just as Password1 but it is not accepting it or various other combinations
of this, or get old password.
Thea is obviously panicking as all her homework is on here and she can’t
email teachers to explain.
Any ideas gratefully received!

Hi Kevin
I noticed the recent security setting alterations last week as 'access
denied' for non school memory ticks etc so have brought my laptop in this
week .
It would be helpful at some stage just for convenience if I could link to
school Wi-fi for my laptop, but not urgent as I mainly use the PC in Sarah
Robinson's careers room which you set me up for.

Could you let me know if this is possible and what I would need to do etc.

Many thanks

Hi Helen

Thank you for getting back to me.

I can now confirm that everything is in place to complete your InVentry
system refresh on *25/01/2023**.*

Your engineer is called *Alex Pearson* and will arrive at site between
* 11:30 *and *13:30* to complete your refresh.

Please could you make sure that everything is in place ready for the
engineer to complete the site visit. If there are any issues that arise
outside of InVentry’s control, a chargeable return visit maybe required.

Just a reminder that we do require your IT support technician to assist the
engineer with network ports/network IP addresses. This can be remote or
onsite support.

*PLEASE NOTE: Your system will be down whilst the upgrade is taking place.
You will need to have alternative methods in place for signing in and
out. We recommend using a paper list to record Visitor, Staff and Pupil
Sign In's/ Out's and our engineer will be able to add all of this
information into the newly update Inventry software when the refresh is
complete.*

Due to having to carry heavy tools and equipment, we kindly ask if our
engineer can park within your onsite car park. If this is not possible,
please could you advise on nearby parking facilities that our engineer can
use.



Your InVentry equipment is going to be shipped directly to your before your
installation. It will be directed to the address provided on your order -
this will be marked for your attention. The package will be shipped in a
large, reinforced cardboard box, which will be clearly labelled with
‘InVentry’. This box should only be opened by your InVentry engineer,
otherwise it could void the warranty of your InVentry equipment. The
package will need to be signed for and safely retained within your
organisation, ready for our installation engineer. If you would like the
InVentry equipment to be shipped to a different location or to a different
person, please can you let me by return email as soon as possible.

In the meantime, if you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact
me or one of my colleagues within the scheduling team.

Kind regards

Hi Helen

I have just tried to call you but unfortunatley you were unavailable.

Thank you for your purchase of a system refresh.

Please review the attached system refresh preparation document, as this
provides important information about refreshing your InVentry hardware.

Our next available date for your refresh is* 25/01/2023**. *I have reserved
this date for you until* close of business today (13/01/2023)*. If you
could confirm suitability as soon as possible, it would be greatly
appreciated. If we haven’t received confirmation by this date, the
reservation will be removed and we will need to arrange a new date.

We do require your IT support technician to be available to assist the
engineer with network ports/network IP addresses, testing the backup,
testing the MIS, installing Anti-Virus and adding the InVentry admin
software to the various computers.

*Your system will be down whilst the upgrade is taking place. You will need
to have alternative methods in place for signing in and out. *

*We recommend using a paper list to record visitors, staff and pupils
signing in/out and our engineer will be able to add this information into
the newly update Inventry software when the refresh is complete.*

Due to having to carry heavy tools and equipment, we kindly ask if our
engineer can park within your onsite car park. If this is not possible,
please could you advise on nearby parking facilities that our engineer can
use.



Your InVentry equipment is going to be shipped directly to your site before
your installation. It will be directed to the address provided on your
order - this will be marked for your attention. The package will be shipped
in a large, reinforced cardboard box, which will be clearly labelled with
‘InVentry’. This box should only be opened by your InVentry engineer,
otherwise it could void the warranty of your InVentry equipment. The
package will need to be signed for and safely retained within your
organisation, ready for our installation engineer. If you would like the
InVentry equipment to be shipped to a different location or to a different
person, please can you let me by return email as soon as possible.



In the meantime, if you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact
me or one of my colleagues within the scheduling team.

 Kind regards

If I have shared a drive and folders with an email group, do the staff
within this group automatically have permissions or do I need to
individually assign this to each person? We have an all.teaching@rufforth
email group and I have used this as a way of sharing drives and folders
with teachers and TAs. They are 'managers' in some of the drives yet are
unable to move folders or documents.

,T20230113.0090,Computers in L33,"Hi,

I know that the computers in L33 are due for an upgrade soon but they are
unusable at the minute. It's 20 mins into the lesson and most of the
computers aren't logged on yet even though they are sitting in their
regular seats. Those that have logged on, they are really, really slow.

There are also a couple of computers that don't work at all. Are there any
computers that were removed from other rooms that could temporarily be
moved into L33 to replace the completely broken ones?

Any idea when L33 computers might be replaced as I have to get coursework
done in these lessons?

Hi Lyn

I have just tried to call you but was unable to get through.

Thank you for your purchase of a system refresh.

Please review the attached system refresh preparation document, as this
provides important information about refreshing your InVentry hardware.

Our next available date for your refresh is* 20/01/2023 for a late
morning/early afternoon appointment**. *I have reserved this date for you
until* 10am tomorrow (13/01/2023)*. If you could confirm suitability as
soon as possible, it would be greatly appreciated. If we haven’t received
confirmation by this date, the reservation will be removed and we will need
to arrange a new date.

We do require your IT support technician to be available to assist the
engineer with network ports/network IP addresses, testing the backup,
testing the MIS, installing Anti-Virus and adding the InVentry admin
software to the various computers.

*Your system will be down whilst the upgrade is taking place. You will need
to have alternative methods in place for signing in and out. *

*We recommend using a paper list to record visitors, staff and pupils
signing in/out and our engineer will be able to add this information into
the newly update Inventry software when the refresh is complete.*

Due to having to carry heavy tools and equipment, we kindly ask if our
engineer can park within your onsite car park. If this is not possible,
please could you advise on nearby parking facilities that our engineer can
use.



Your InVentry equipment is going to be shipped directly to your site before
your installation. It will be directed to the address provided on your
order - this will be marked for your attention. The package will be shipped
in a large, reinforced cardboard box, which will be clearly labelled with
‘InVentry’. This box should only be opened by your InVentry engineer,
otherwise it could void the warranty of your InVentry equipment. The
package will need to be signed for and safely retained within your
organisation, ready for our installation engineer. If you would like the
InVentry equipment to be shipped to a different location or to a different
person, please can you let me by return email as soon as possible.



In the meantime, if you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact
me or one of my colleagues within the scheduling team.

Kind regards

The double Dell monitors on Di Hewitson's desk here in the central offices

The cable does provide power to my laptop, however, so that element at

,T20230112.0111,Re: New starter,"FYI:
Ruby attended AHS in Y7:
[image: image.png]
And applied to join us again at the start of Y9, but did not actually
attend.

As she already existed in SIMS, I have had to remove the new account (Ruby
Ann, middle name Jade and the incorrect DOB) and readmit her (Ruby, middle
names Ann Jade and DOB 11/9/2007), so the Census will not have the error.

*IT*, will this need anything amending at your end?
*Mike*, I'm afraid the deletion lost the time table for her (she's absent
today).
*Lucy*, I managed to keep the attendance, but your notes will need re
entering.

was wondering if some sites could be unblocked in order for me to get on
with some work.
I am wanting to browse some education science supplier websites to compare
prices to other sites for putting an order together.
YPO and some other science suppliers aren't blocked but the ones I would
ideally like to use are. Is it possible to unblock anything please?

Hi miss,

as well as the bibliography website, jstor has also been blocked, disabling
us from accessing books with our google accounts. I checked with Niamh and
it's blocked for her too. This one is more widely used by students and has
a few key sources I need on it. I can get around it by using a personal
google account when at home but this will likely cause issues when trying
to write further at school. I'd appreciate it if you could let the tech
guys know and update us if/ when our access has been restored.

Hey,

Please may you ask Vital to look into something for me...

Is there any way to change the format of a picture taken on a mobile phone?
The pics that Ruth Inkley takes are a .heic file - Twitter and the school
website doesn't recognise this. Do Vital have a solution or can suggest
some software that we can use to convert them into a jpeg format or similar?

Thank you!

Charlotte

Hi Charlotte and Ruth

Here are 5 photos I took in Friday's Spanish lessons from both classes.
Please could you upload them onto Twitter at some point this coming week. I
did check with each child before I took their photo that they were allowed
on the School Twitter feed and all the ones I captured said they were, but
do please double check first.

You could say something along the lines of:
Year 6 started their Spring term in Spanish learning about the importance
of Spanish as a world language. They had to use good dictionary skills,
reading comprehension skills and strong team-work to work out the meaning
of some key facts in Spanish posted around the room in order to answer some
specific questions. Well done Year 6!

Thanks so much
Ruth

As per our conversation earlier, the sims fileset is currently 2300.  Please can this be updated to the latest version tomorrow after 4pm?

I will need fileset 2303 in place before the census on 19th January, but I understand only fileset 2302 may have been released do far.

I'll ask everyone to logout tomorrow before 4pm for you to run the update, but am aware a further update will be needed when fileset 2303 is released.

Hi Jonathan,

Not a problem, I’m sure Amanda has told you that there’s an issue with too many people being singed it at once, and that limit is 20 (not something I knew before I gave access to so many people)

I’m currently working on removing the shortcut from the desktop of anyone not in the all.ssl group, and removing their access to the console logon. Hopefully this should fix the issue.

I’ll give you an update once everything has been reduced back.

Cheers,
James

Thank you

Academy | CRM:03290728
To: Lindsay Wilson <l.wilson@ebor.academy>


Hi Lindsay

Following on from our telephone conversation.

I can now confirm that everything is in place to complete your InVentry
system refresh on *12/01/2023**.*

Your engineer is called *Alex Pearson* and will arrive at site between
* 12:00 *and *14:00* to complete your refresh.

Please could you make sure that everything is in place ready for the
engineer to complete the site visit. If there are any issues that arise
outside of InVentry’s control, a chargeable return visit maybe required.

Just a reminder that we do require your IT support technician to assist the
engineer with network ports/network IP addresses. This can be remote or
onsite support.

*PLEASE NOTE: Your system will be down whilst the upgrade is taking place.
You will need to have alternative methods in place for signing in and
out. We recommend using a paper list to record Visitor, Staff and Pupil
Sign In's/ Out's and our engineer will be able to add all of this
information into the newly update Inventry software when the refresh is
complete.*

Due to having to carry heavy tools and equipment, we kindly ask if our
engineer can park within your onsite car park. If this is not possible,
please could you advise on nearby parking facilities that our engineer can
use.



Your InVentry equipment is going to be shipped directly to your before your
installation. It will be directed to the address provided on your order -
this will be marked for your attention. The package will be shipped in a
large, reinforced cardboard box, which will be clearly labelled with
‘InVentry’. This box should only be opened by your InVentry engineer,
otherwise it could void the warranty of your InVentry equipment. The
package will need to be signed for and safely retained within your
organisation, ready for our installation engineer. If you would like the
InVentry equipment to be shipped to a different location or to a different
person, please can you let me by return email as soon as possible.

In the meantime, if you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact
me or one of my colleagues within the scheduling team.

Kind regards

Our new Teacher Jamie Thomas is having some trouble with printing.
When he started last week one of the TA's Nathaniel signed into Uniflow so
Jamie could print while awaiting me sorting Jamie with a printer code.
Uniflow looks like it is signed in as Jamie but when he puts his code in
the printer his printing is not there. Is there a way to fix this?
Also he has signed into Microsoft Office on the computer using his SMCCAT
email but it is giving him a message about not being licensed, so he is
therefore unable to edit any documents. Is it possible to fix this also?

,T20230111.0212,Faulty Interactive Whiteboard,"Hello,

Good morning,

I am in Year Six Classroom Whale.

I have an issue that has happened to me already this year in this
classroom. The Board will not turn on, previously I updated software and it
worked. The audio is on and the board has power but the screen is black. It
says I cannot update the SMART Product Driver (which I installed and ran
the update for) because Notepad is not the updated version 11.2 (I think).
Even though I did activate the latest version downloaded in the SMART
software update centre.

Can you help remotely with this PC or if you can send support that would be
great.

Thank you,

Our receptionist tried to access the following webpage to issue a voucher
for our YHS-Guest WiFi:

https://10.44.237.110:8443/manage/hotspot-manager

However the page doesn't load; we tried multiple PCs and web browsers and
it just times out (10.44.237.110 took too long to respond; ERR_TIMED_OUT)

I can ping the server (YHS-Unify01) and if I just browse to the IP address,
it does load a login page (but the voucher issuing account doesn't login
from that page).

If this is something we can do ourselves, please advise how, or
alternatively if you can get it working that would be great (maybe
the server just needs a reboot?)

Many thanks,

Hi Giles

I've been asked to report the following;


  *   Cable from main photocopier not working for printing documents (therefore very large queue at peak times for the other one)
  *   Both Year 5 pc's don't work
  *   Year 1 pc doesn't work.  Projects the image onto the whiteboard but the pc screen doesn't show it so they can't see what they are showing the children
Probably best if someone can swing by and check in with everyone for any issues as these are only the ones been brought to my attention

Thanks

No rush for me because I've done a workaround, but just letting you know.
Andrew - I know you're in here later so just FYI

I wondered if you can help with our group settings on gmail.
We have groups set up i.e all.staff etc to enable staff to send a relevant
email to everyone in a particular group.
My understanding is that Vital have set up these groups but I would like
to know how we edit them and how they work. Do staff drop out of the group
once they are given a leave date? What is the best way to have a member of
staff added to the group? Is this something we can keep updating as it does
sound a bit silly if we have to keep asking you?

the speakers are still not right. The sound quality is not the same volume

Plus, could you sort the LRC PC out so it works with Google (green label

,T20230110.0411,Potential firewall issues,"Good morning

We have found a couple of issues where pupils have been able to access
unsuitable material.

1. There is an explicit image on one of our pupil i pads. It looks like
it's a screen shot rather than a photo that has been taken.
The date on it is 18th October 2022 17:27
It is on pupil i pad 04
We've checked the other i pads and they are all fine.

We can probably identify the pupil who has accessed it as it was used in
our After School Club.
However, my question is how did the pupil access this image?
Are you able to identify the search that might have been carried out so the
particular website in question can be blocked?

2. When children are working on the Turtle Academy website
https://turtleacademy.com/playground
various adverts pop up. I saw one that was entitled something like 'Do you
want a Ukranian Girl?'
I don't know what content was in this as I didn't want to click on it in
the middle of a lesson and it had gone off later in the day. I guess it
would be unsuitable. I just told the children not to click on any of the
adverts.

This is a website that children need to use for their computing lessons so
is there a way to avoid adverts on this website?

Please can you have a look into these issues?

Thanks
Karen

Hi Kerry,

Unfortunately, the email address I have been given does not work. I am
unable to login and it is not recognised as a valid email. Also, I believe
my name is wrong on the account. It should be Anya Findlay
afindlay@olqm.smccat.org.uk . Sorry for any inconvenience this causes.

Many thanks,
Anya Findlay.

Good day,

When next someone is on site please could I ask for the following tests to
be run?

1.What speed is the user seeing? (speedtest.net and fast.com)
2.Is the problem site wide or isolated to specific machine/user?
3.Is it all day or at a specific time?
4.Please could you ping your LAN gateway and send through the results?
5.Please could you ping 8.8.8.8 and send through the results?

Following these tests could you please reboot the Mikrotik Router and NTU
and perform the tests again?

Should the issue still persist following the reboot we will need to run a
single machine test hard wired into the Mikrotik router on site before we
can proceed with logging this with our supplier.

Kind regards,
Ashley- CTS

Hi Tracey

I have just tried to call you but unfortunatley I was unable to get
through.

Thank you for your purchase of a system refresh.

Please review the attached system refresh preparation document, as this
provides important information about refreshing your InVentry hardware.

Our next available date for your refresh is* 17/01/2023**. *I have reserved
this date for you until* close of business today (10/01/2023)*. If you
could confirm suitability as soon as possible, it would be greatly
appreciated. If we haven’t received confirmation by this date, the
reservation will be removed and we will need to arrange a new date.

We do require your IT support technician to be available to assist the
engineer with network ports/network IP addresses, testing the backup,
testing the MIS, installing Anti-Virus and adding the InVentry admin
software to the various computers.

*Your system will be down whilst the upgrade is taking place. You will need
to have alternative methods in place for signing in and out. *

*We recommend using a paper list to record visitors, staff and pupils
signing in/out and our engineer will be able to add this information into
the newly update Inventry software when the refresh is complete.*

Due to having to carry heavy tools and equipment, we kindly ask if our
engineer can park within your onsite car park. If this is not possible,
please could you advise on nearby parking facilities that our engineer can
use.



Your InVentry equipment is going to be shipped directly to your site before
your installation. It will be directed to the address provided on your
order - this will be marked for your attention. The package will be shipped
in a large, reinforced cardboard box, which will be clearly labelled with
‘InVentry’. This box should only be opened by your InVentry engineer,
otherwise it could void the warranty of your InVentry equipment. The
package will need to be signed for and safely retained within your
organisation, ready for our installation engineer. If you would like the
InVentry equipment to be shipped to a different location or to a different
person, please can you let me by return email as soon as possible.



In the meantime, if you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact
me or one of my colleagues within the scheduling team.

Kind regards

To: Liz Cooper <l.cooper@pop.hslt.academy<mailto:l.cooper@pop.hslt.academy>>

Good afternoon,

I spoke briefly to Giles this morning (when he came to set up my desktop with a Google login) about gaining access to the shared Year 4 folders that are on Google Drive, as on Friday, when I received my login details, Tim and I discovered that Ollie was the lead manager on the Year 4 drives and due to this Tim couldn't share them with me.

Giles said that if I email you with the details of the drives needed and the email address they need to be shared with he would be able to sort out the access.

The drives that I need access to are:
Year 4 2021/22
Year 4 2022/23

My email address: r.walker@pop.hslt.academy<mailto:r.walker@pop.hslt.academy>

Many thanks,
Rebecca

Dear Stuart,

I hope your first day back has been good.

I seem to be having an issue with my computer. Every time I log back in its deleted all my data and I need to re-sign in to everything and download outlook again. I have a feeling you mentioned something on Friday about updated your computer, but I am really sorry I can’t seem to remember what you said.
I don’t suppose you can offer any advice on this matter?

Best wishes,

Hi Tamara,

My name is still showing up as wrong on my parent trustee account. When I
go into Google Account > Basic Info > Name it is showing as Haley instead
of Hayley so it keeps popping up wrong each time. It’s greyed out so I
can’t edit it myself and needs to be changed by Admin. I’ve attached a
photo of my screen if that helps. Not the best quality though!

6pm, over the weekend or during a holiday period, it is likely that a
response will be given during the school’s normal working hours. Thank you
in advance for your understanding in helping us to promote a happy, healthy
and productive workforce.

My year 11 film students have been using Writerduet to work on their
screenplays for the coursework. As they have tried to log in today they
have run into an authorisation error caused by a block put on the system by
Vital which means they cannot use their google accounts to log in.

Would it be possible for you to remove the block so they can log back in
and continue with their coursework? I appreciate that you are currently
being ultra-security conscious but once they hove logged in we can create
new passwords using the email address so it's not using the google login if
you prefer.

Many thanks

Would it be possible for the smartboard and computer to be set up in G15. I
had asked the site team to assist with this but they haven't been able to.
I do teach all my classes in G15 and do use the screen so it would be very
helpful to have it back up. I also will need the new software to be
installed on the computer in G15 please.
Many thanks,
Lydia

I have been able to log into Edulink, however I cannot access my registers
as I get the error message 'SIMS command failed'. I'm not sure if I'll be
the only one, but it could be because we cannot access SIMS yet. I have
CC'd IT support into this email.

Kind regards,

Greg

As per the email thread below, our new headteacher would like to use
Microsoft Sway for communication.  Initially just the 5 members of SLT need
to access it but eventually we would like to roll it out to all staff.

Can you advise how we can go about accessing this?  Can you do something
remotely or will Adam need to call in?

Thanks

Hi Gill
I am really keen to update how and when we engage with parents
-particularly around newsletters.I have made the transition back to
google/gmail and the only thing that I really miss is the ability to use MS
Sway.  I implemented this at Stamford Bridge PS and used it weekly - made
weekly newsletters much easier!

https://sway.office.com/LN6s3rYevVbcilCR?ref=Link

I know all PMAT schools are on GMail.  I do not want to use Outlook 365
just SWAY

*Please can you ask Adam how I can expedite sorting this please?*

I only need it initially but will want colleagues in SLT and MLT to have it
soon so we can edit collaboratively.

I have tried to access and this is the message I receive.

Many thanks
Claire

,T20230106.0151,Re: Period 2 Thursday Walking Talking Mock each week to half term,"Hi All,

Not to throw a spanner in the works but has consideration been given with
regards to the number of students and tables required alongside the fire
safety limitations of the Hall and the preparation and removal time?

If you are putting 200 students into the main Hall, you would by your
calculations need around 34 desks putting out. When you put six people
around each desk there is not going to be enough space to allow for safe
evacuation in case of a fire.

We also have an issue with staffing to complete this task from a site point
of view. Ian is needed at George Pindar on Thursdays and only one member of
the site team is currently able to put these desks out which would be a
difficult undertaking in the hour after the assembly has finished.

I would like to try and resolve this for you though, are the tables
definitely needed?

Thanks

,T20230106.0148,Need to access a Zoom Teachmeet on Monday.,"Hello Mike

So sorry so send a ticket with all you have going on.

I am due to do an online Zoom on Monday afternoon for a CDP event and was
wondering if these mythical Chromebooks will in fact be here?

If they aren't, will I be able to join a Zoom for my 'Chromebook PC' in H1?
Even if I can, I have no camera of microphone....

I usually bring my laptop and use its camera and mic for online meetings
which generally works fine, but I am guessing that this will not be allowed
on Monday still...

The Zoom is at 3.45 so there is absolutely no way I can get home in time to
do it there.

Sorry to cause more issues.

Thanks

I have had to download as PDF to attach and send - then the group worked.

Fiona Roberts has just let me know of an issue with printing from the PCs
at Staveley. She said when staff log on to a different PC to one they use
regularly, they then can't print (for example she's just logged onto the PC
in the Focus Room, and can't print from there).

Can you please let me know how we solve this - we need all staff to be able
to print from any of the PCs.

Thanks

Good afternoon Jackie,

Hi Jackie,

Hope you are well. As I remoted onto the unit I was unable to sign into SIMS.net I was wondering if you are able to reset the password for inventrysims. So we are able to investigate the current issue you are experiencing.
I have now remoted off the system, once we hear back from you I will give you a call to gain remote access on to the unit so I am able too continue to Investigate this issue.

Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Hello Jackie,

Thank you for your time on the phone. As discussed you are currently experiencing an issue with SIMS Sync (Pupil).

I will now connect to your system to investigate the above issue. During this process, we will attempt to blank the screen out, as this may contain personal information. However, we would appreciate if you could take some precautions in case the connection drops, exposing the screen's display. This can be done by turning screen around or covering the display.

As agreed on the phone, if we are not able to resolve your issue in our first session, you have requested that before one of our support technicians remotely connects to the InVentry system that we need to contact you before every remote connection.

Please be advised that due to selecting this option it may affect the length of time it takes to resolve the current issue. Alternatively, if there are certain times in the day that we are able to connect without calling you first, please respond to this email with your preferred times/days of the week.

Kind regards

I know you have already checked for me whether I am on all the mailing
lists that I should be but I am still not receiving certain emails.

This seems to be a random problem rather than related to a particular
mailing list as I never received one yesterday that was sent to
asa.allstaff@hslt.academy (email from Paul Fraser at 13:23 on 04/01 with
attachments regarding arrangements for today and tomorrow) but I received a
different email today that was also sent to that mailing list (from Donna
Bowman around 9am about parents evening). So I am at a loss to explain why
some are getting through and not others.

Today was not the first time someone has mentioned an email that went out
to 'everyone' but that there is no sign of in my inbox.

I have checked 'spam' but it is empty.

I know you have bigger fish to fry right now but when you get chance to see
if you can work out what's going on that would be awesome.

We've been stumped today as to why we've been unable to take photos off
cameras using USB card readers...then I remembered about the block on using
them.
In Art we use SLR cameras daily, with A-level and GCSE groups, and the only
way to take the photos off the cameras is to use a USB card reader, or a
cable.
Can these please be re-instated on all computers in Art to enable us to
fulfil the needs of our subject and students.

I will have a look at the clicker app for the clicker books and let you
know.
We can get a version of Clicker writer on all the chromebooks but some of
them keep giving us the license box and then don't work properly.
I have forwarded you an email from Clicker with how to rectify this. Are
you able to do this?

Best Wishes

Hi Sarah



Thanks for getting in touch again, and for sending over that picture. Happy
New Year!



To confirm, 1-7 are licensed, while 8, 9 and 10 aren’t yet.

If you were using 1-7 and this still appeared, pop-ups may be blocked.
Google has made a change that causes the account log-in window to need to
appear every time Clicker Writer is opened, and that’s classed as a pop-up.

We require the Google login for licensing. Therefore, for licensing to
work, we need pop-ups to be enabled on our apps.

Please send this information over to your IT Support:

The URLs to whitelist in Google Admin are:
https://clickerwriter.apps.cricksoft.com
https://clickerbooks.apps.cricksoft.com
https://clickertalk.apps.cricksoft.com

Within the Google Admin console, the URL whitelist can be found in: Devices
> Chrome > Settings > Users & browsers. From there, where it says “Search
or add a filter”, type “Pop-up”. It should be listed under “Content”.

Kind regards

Hello



Happy New Year



We are still experiencing some issues with our Clicker license. Our ICT
support has loaded the app on all the chromebooks with the idea that when
we log in as Clicker 1-10 the ap should work. It won't work if we don't log
in as this.

Many of our devices keep showing a licensing box even when we log in as
clicker 1 - 10. What are we doing wrong? The below picture shows you what
we are seeing.

Many thanks

I am currently trying to either share some documents with Helen Spring at
Primary Science Quality Mark or upload them through the PSQM website or
email them to her from our shared drive/google docs. Before Christmas I was
able to upload the docs or send them to her, but now I don't seem to have
permission, so something seems to have changed over Christmas. This is an
ongoing project working towards Primary Science Quality Mark accreditation
and the trust are doing a deep dive into science on the 16th January. It is
critical that I am able to upload documents to the PSQM website and also
forward them to Helen Spring.

Thank you for your help.

This email originated from outside of the organisation. Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe.

Hi,
The following two students are unable to access their accounts when using school chromebooks.

17isaacn@stpaulsprimaryyork.com<mailto:17isaacn@stpaulsprimaryyork.com>

17matildad@stpaulsprimaryyork.com<mailto:17matildad@stpaulsprimaryyork.com>

In both cases, when they sign in, it begins to load up, but then freezes/crashes. We have tried it on many different Chromebooks at the school, so it isn't confined to just one device.
However, both students are able to access their accounts when they sign in on computers at home.
The problem has been occurring for a number of months for both students.

Please could you look into this, and try to help resolve it.
Many thanks!

Paul Cawood

Hi and happy new year!

Antoine is working off site this week and has been unable to access his school account. We believe this is due to the password change. Please could you therefore reset Antoine's password and let him know what it will be (I have ccd him into this email) so that he can work from home?

Thank you,

Liz

Hi Claire,

I'm having trouble charging my laptop. I've tried a couple of different
cables but to no avail. I'm having to bend the cable for it to register
that it's charging which doesn't seem good. Please could you ask someone to
have a look at it.

Thanks

,T20230105.0102,The Compass Academy - Nurture Unit,"Good Morning,

I am emailing to report technical issues we are still experiencing on the
nurture wing at The Compass Academy.


   - The nurture classrooms are still not connected to the network printers
   which makes it difficult for planning and resourcing.
   - The IWB In N1 classroom cuts out every 3-5 minutes and reboots with a
   blue screen. Due to the nature of our students this is a real issue as many
   have issues such as ADHD.
   - The monitor in N2 is showing a blank screen although it is 'ON' as the
   IWB is getting the signal. The teacher is having to work off the IWB.


It would be much appreciated if these issues could be rectified asap.

Many Thanks

We have a projector in the hall that is not working.  It is not receiving
any power.  I've tried changing the fuse and socket, but I don't know what
else to try.  Is it possible for someone to look at it and see whether
there's anything that can be done or whether we need a new one?

,T20230105.0040,Problems with G.C - Arts Award,"Hi,
This term we are picking up classes we taught Autumn term 1 in Art (for
Arts Award).
In Autumn term, my classes did homework in Google classroom, which (now
I've picked the class back up) has disappeared.
The intention was to use this work as part of their Arts Award evidence as
it links in perfectly.
I'm now in a bit of a panic that we've done a lot of work which is now
lost!? The work posted by their previous teachers is still there, but not
mine from Autumn 1.
I had assumed that we would carry over the G.C classes, not have new ones
created!
The classes are:
9C/Da2
9ab/Da3
9D/Da2
Are you able to shed any light on this?
Thansk,
Beth

Hi Julie



Following on from our telephone conversation.



I can now confirm that everything is in place to complete your InVentry
system refresh on *11/01/2023.*



Your engineer is called *Matthew Jarrett* and will arrive at site between
*08:30* and *09:00* to complete your refresh.

Please could you make sure that everything is in place ready for the
engineer to complete the site visit. If there are any issues that arise
outside of InVentry’s control, a chargeable return visit maybe required.

Just a reminder that we do require your IT support technician to assist the
engineer with network ports/network IP addresses. This can be remote or
onsite support.

*PLEASE NOTE: Your system will be down whilst the upgrade is taking place.
You will need to have alternative methods in place for signing in and
out. We recommend using a paper list to record Visitor, Staff and Pupil
Sign In's/ Out's and our engineer will be able to add all of this
information into the newly update Inventry software when the refresh is
complete.*

Due to having to carry heavy tools and equipment, we kindly ask if our
engineer can park within your onsite car park. If this is not possible,
please could you advise on nearby parking facilities that our engineer can
use.



Your InVentry equipment is going to be shipped directly to your before your
installation. It will be directed to the address provided on your order -
this will be marked for your attention. The package will be shipped in a
large, reinforced cardboard box, which will be clearly labelled with
‘InVentry’. This box should only be opened by your InVentry engineer,
otherwise it could void the warranty of your InVentry equipment. The
package will need to be signed for and safely retained within your
organisation, ready for our installation engineer. If you would like the
InVentry equipment to be shipped to a different location or to a different
person, please can you let me by return email as soon as possible.

In the meantime, if you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact
me or one of my colleagues within the scheduling team.

Kind regards

Notes to support the above

















Section B Additional Information

This section allows you to bring anything relevant to our attention. Please
note that at this stage of the process we are simply reviewing whether the
school requires funding or not, and a huge amount of technical detail is
not required. *This section can be left blank.*

Equipment Accommodation

*If there is anything unusual or complex about how server rooms/ comms
rooms/ cabinet locations are set up that may be a problem in upgrading the
network, please note it here.** eg the school has a number of small wall
mounted cabinets that would benefit from being consolidated together.*

Passive network

*If there is anything unusual or complex about the way the buildings are
cabled that might be an issue, please note it here.** eg there are faults
with the cabling that would service some wireless access points which will
need replacing.*

Building Interconnects

*If there is anything unusual or complex about the way buildings at the
site are networked together, please note it here.** eg there is an
outbuilding that currently has classes but does not have a network
connection.*

Immediate Plans

*If there are any significant changes at the site (such as building works)
taking place in the next 12 months, please use this space to let us know.**
eg the school is having a major refurbishment in the infants block at the
start of 2023 and any networking changes would be better timed for the
completion of that work.*

Other

*If there is anything else you feel is relevant to potentially investing in
networking at the site in the coming 12 months, please mention it here**.
eg the school is in the process of joining XXXX Academy Trust and they
should be involved in any decisions about what any new network equipment
might be.*

Hi Alex,



Hope you had a nice Christmas break and new year.



I can re-set your password if you’re struggling to get into your Decision
Time account but if it’s your school email address I’m afraid I can’t help.


You could possibly drop an email to Liz Cooper at the school (
l.cooper@pop.hslt.academy) who may either be able to help or will have a
better idea of who can help reset your email’s password.   Thanks Lou

I have spoke to Joe about the issue and ICT4Leeds and they have run some check and upon checking from my side I think there is a new setting on the Chromebooks which is causing the issue. The button which says allow proxies for shared networks is unticked which makes it go to a page that doesn’t load anything. This needs to be clicked to allow all the websites to be click. Can it be updated on your admin console?

need the BT phone line that was originally linked to the main school number?

Hi Jane,



No problem at all,



BT IPEX is our platform for virtualising numbers, for use with IP telephony
but isn’t solely used by BT, some VoIP providers place numbers there to
allow them to work on their own platform. This form is the customer letter
of authority to move the number from traditional copper telephony to IP. Do
you know who this was sent to? As I’m unable to see this as a billing
number on the systems I have access, it could be the latter mentioned above
and actually be with another provider. Who do you receive invoices for
telephone services from, aside from BT?

Hi Darren



Thank you for replying so quickly.  Our IT provider dealt with the transfer
however, I submitted the form attached - it refers to BT IPEX.  They
however, didn't give advice on lines, hence my questions.  We are still
getting bills for all three lines at the moment but understand that two of
the lines are in hand as per the email chain this morning.



My next job is to look at Riston Primary Academy, Main Street, Riston, HU11
5JF to see if we have any lines that are currently not in use.



I appreciate your help with this.



Take care

Hi Jane,



That number appears to have ported out from traditional telephony to VoIP.



I would however, recommend confirming with your IP Voice supplier to
confirm they have it on their network as a working number to be 100% sure.



From what I can see, I shouldn’t expect you have any invoices relating to
this number from BT.

Hello Jane



Is the VOIP with BT?



Normally with VOIP the PSTN rental element is removed as no longer needed
as it works off your broadband service, however @Keep,D,Darren,NAX R
<darren.keep@bt.com> are you able to confirm

Good morning



Thank you for confirming that the cancellation is in hand.



Can I just clarify we submitted a request to retain the number 01964 533770
on the school main line when we moved to VOIP which has been done.  Does
the VOIP line still have a phone line attached to it or should this line be
cancelled as well?



Thank you



Kind regards

Dear Miss Cooper,

My son Henry Ekers in 7PE, has had problems with his school Google account
log in and logging onto the school network.

We had problems before Christmas and he was given a new password for his
Google account which allowed him on.

Now however, he cannot log on. Today the office gave him two passwords to
try and neither worked. They told my son that he should email you.

If possible, is there someone who could help him and also watch him log in
as I am not sure whether the passwords genuinely do not work or he is not
typing them in accurately.

I do hope you can help Henry in resolving this problem so that he can not
only log on to his school Google account but get access to the school
network.

Kind regards,
Di (mum)

Hi Kat and Debbie,

I'm having a problem with the microphone on my laptop - when I'm on a zoom
meeting  I am not accessing the audio and have got around the problem by
dialing on my phone which is not ideal.  Can you advise anything to try and
if I just need to book it into vital?

Got zooms coming up that I need to fully participate in - so would be good
to sort ASAP.

I have been given the Wifi password from the office which used to be all I
needed to access the wifi on my phone but since we changed to the new wifi
Poppleton_Road, it brings up things about certificates and domains.  Until
I connect my phone, I can't use my Amazon Dot.

Hope you are all well.

Just before we broke up Marcus came with Marcel to look at a couple of problems here in school, one of them was regarding our raspberry Pi, Marcus said he was going to look into it as it appears to be no longer working on our LCD screen, allowing us to show photos across the screen..

Linda has asked that it is sorted by the end of this week, if it is need sortable.

Please advise asap.

Thank you

,T20230103.0185,Printers and printer codes,"Hi,

I have 2 queries please

The first one is that we are still unable to log onto our printers.
They were working first thing this morning, then they went off line about
10.30 ish. I called to query it and was advised to call back in an hour if
they were still offline as it might have something to do with the whole
trust network being reset.

Unfortunately we are still offline, so I would be grateful if you
could confirm if this is something that is being looked at.

Also I tried to set up new printer codes for staff members at the end of
term last year, I have not had any training on how to do this ... and what
I did didn't work.
Please could someone either set up printer codes for the new staff members
or talk me through / send me instructions on how to do it so that I can do
it for future new staff.

I can send you the new staff names if it is something you will do.

Thanks very much for your help

Hi,
The projector in class 5 isn't working. When I turn it on, the fan in the projector makes a loud noise, and an orange light that says 'lamp' comes on.
Please can you contact Vital about it to see if they can help, as I really need to be able to use it once term starts urgently .

Hi Claire,

Thanks for your reply,

I have checked the Wonde panel and can see that the Employee report is failing, this may be why the data isn't pulling through.

I have raised this with Wonde and I will be in touch as soon as I have any updates.

I have asked Edukey to Sync Sims and ClassCharts, but the report is failing (see below).

Not sure whether this has happened before, but wanted to keep you in the loop.

Is there anything we need to do at our end?

Hi Claire,

Thanks for your reply,

I have checked the Wonde panel and can see that the Employee report is failing, this may be why the data isn't pulling through.

I have raised this with Wonde and I will be in touch as soon as I have any updates.

Best wishes,

Zoe

Hi Helen,

Is there any way we can reserve chrome books for my coursework lessons?
Some students are unable to log on due to how slow some of the computers
are in L32, today a few have had to use their phones to access the work and
materials but this puts some behind in terms of typing up in lessons?

Thanks

,T20230102.0017,Remove Vital Admin from Compass Shared Drives,"Hi Ross, are we ok to remove the VitalAdmin account from the drives created for compass? I have emialed Clair to say we will do this.

Thank you 

Giles
Email From Clair

Evening Giles,

It has been queried by HR, whether or not Vital admin should have access rights to documents that are held on our admin drive, particularly referrals relating to health etc.

Is it possible to remove access rights to documents which may be considered to be sensitive in their nature please?

I understand that as documents have migrated across that access rights were open to allow for the transition to take place, however, now that this has occurred is it possible for vital admin to be removed from certain documents?

Hi there!</br>
</br>
I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your
operating system.</br>
Currently I have gained full access to your account. </br>
</br>
In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you
for several months. </br>
The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the
fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. &#9581;
&#5198; &#9582;</br>
</br>
Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can
gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.</br>
It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on
the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your
permission. </br>
In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as
well as your emails and chat messages.</br>
</br>
You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious
software. </br>
Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is
driver-based, </br>
which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is
unable to detect it presence.</br>
</br>
I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of
you happily masturbating, </br>
while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that
moment..&#7508;.&#7508;</br>
</br>
All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger
contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC. </br>
Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.</br>
</br>
I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening. </br>
Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 790 USD to
my Bitcoin account </br>
(that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if
you don't know how to do that).</br>
</br>
Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet):
1GdVKgGS8iXeSSrynTfHyDugrpchwVDmdZ</br>
</br>
Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with
deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.
</br>
Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2
days +). </br>
I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the
countdown will start.</br>
</br>
Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.</br>
If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight
away proceed with making your private videos public.</br>
</br>
Good luck!

I'm not sure of the exact details of the rule but can you implement  a rule
to enable SIMS InTouch, with the same settings you did for Millthorpe
please?

I am not sure if this is a rule to apply on all clients or the server (
YHS-SIMS) or both.

Also  as a general query last week Dan showed me a way to look at the ESET
diagnostics but this asks for a password; are we supposed to have a
password for that or do we need to implement a remote session? (presumably
not relevant this time round as it will be the same as Millthorpes, so more
for future reference...)

,T20221217.0014,Fwd: Teachers of BF (Year 11),"Hi Ben,

Could you have a look at the email chain below and investigate how Google
Classroom works with inviting guardians.

The parent has asked for the Google classroom codes / be invited to each
classroom. An English teacher (Natalie Gardner) has invited the parent to
her class, but it now appears that the parent is no showing in all the
other classes.

If you could have a look - not an urgent job - I'd be grateful.

Many thanks,
Andrew

Hi Andrew,

I went to do this and found that she had already been added as a guardian
to my Geography class - I'm not sure how that's happened, particularly
without my permission? I'm happy to leave it but wanted to flag it with
you, as it's contrary to the information in your email.

Best wishes and happy holidays,

Subject: Javafx for NEA

Hello,

I'm having some trouble using Javafx on the school computers, and having done some searching into the issue, most of the solutions involve using the terminal, which I'm unable to do on the school computers.

I'm not fully able to explain the problem as I'm not sure I understand it, but originally, the fxml file in the target folder was saying that the URI http://javafx.com/fxml wasn't recognised, so I added it to the sources in the settings, to which it said the resource registered by the URI wasn't recognised. I went into the settings again to direct it to the javafx files in my external libraries folder, and now it says that none of the javafx attributes are defined, despite them being imported at the top of the file.

I've tried several of the javafx files in that folder, including two specifically labelled fxml. I've also tried adding the URI to the ""Ignored schemas and DTDs"" list, but this just caused the error that VBox wasn't defined.

I know you can't help with programming issues, but I think I've exhausted all programming-related solutions, and this must be an issue with the school computers. It was working when we first started development, and I stopped using fxml for a few weeks to test and prepare other parts of the code, and then it stopped working when I tried to use the same code from before.

Would it be possible to check that fxml is set up on the computers properly?

Thanks in advance and merry Christmas,
Jess WG

Morning Dan

Hope you are well, it's been a while since I have had to email you which is great as everything has been running smoothly.

I was wondering if you are able to help if possible, I have had to buy 2 to replace some broken ones they are the same ones we have already. I have done exactly the same as I have done in the past image them they work fine in school but they will not sign in outside of the school network. I have tried to have a look but I can't see anything different. These are the first 2 new devices I have had to set up since the server has been moved off-site could this be something to do with it? This is the only thing that has changed.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Subject: Scratch files

Hi Lewis,
Might you know, or be able to find out, if/how sb3 files created when you save a Scratch project (on both laptops and chromebooks) can be opened? From what I have read, it seems that it might be necessary to have the Scratch app (if such a thing exists! - I'm not completely clear).
The scheme of work we are using (from the Kapow curriculum), suggests the files can be saved (which they certainly can), but I don't seem to be able to reopen them!
Any suggestions or guidance greatly appreciated.
Many thanks,
Gill.

To: Sam Willsden <swillsden@pmat.academy>


Hi Sam,

I have just read that USB ports across school have been disabled across
school.

Was any warning of this given to us that this was going to happen as I have
just taken over in a new post in school and as part of the handover I was
given a load of really important documents which are currently on my
external hard drive as it was not possible for us to transfer them between
our personal drives on the system?

I will need to access these tomorrow first thing as I am completing an
induction programme with a visiting ITT trainee.

Please can it be possible for me to use the USB drive in Pathfinder
tomorrow morning or can Kevin please transfer all my files onto the system
for me or I will be unable to carry out my job.

Many thanks,

Ralph

I'm very sorry for the confusion this morning - we had no idea it was
happening!

We have had confirmation we are now able to unblock ports for the specific
use of exams, what we need to do is be very clear on which
users/workstations will need this and when as they will need to be locked
down again post exam.

Sorry this just adds in an extra layer of work I know but at least it isn't
a blanket no to USBs - Though I do think we need to look at offline cloud
storage for the future.

,T20221208.0180,Controlled assessment computer requirements,"Hi James

We are aiming to complete our Criminology controlled assessment with students in January. This is an 8 hour internal assessment that can be split over multiple sessions - but all require computer access.

We have two classes which equate to 35 students

For this assessment the following protocols are required

For the first 3 hours of tasks, students are not allowed to have internet access
For the remaining 5 hours of tasks students are allowed internet access as they need to design campaign materials using websites.
Students need to be able to save their work electronically but are not permitted to have access to this outside of the controlled assessment (so unable to use student area/teams etc)
If you could let me know how best we can facilitate this that would be great

,T20221130.0130,App on desktop & spelling shed,"Good morning,

A while ago, someone came in to enable my work laptop to download software
to use my home printer. They seemed to have downloaded something called
WinRAR which seems to hold downloaded files. Now any files I download go
into this WinRAR programme rather than straight into my file explorer.
However, I am now getting notifications that this software is not free and
I need to buy it. I have tried to remove the app from my desktop myself,
however it says it is restricted by my administrator. I've attached some
screen grabs to explain further.

Also, PrimaryTec installed Spelling Shed on our iPads, my understanding is
that for this app we need a login and password. I have asked all relevant
staff and none of them seem to know any linked email or password - do you
have this information?

Please can you let me know if you are planning to send a technician to
school as we are all full/ ppa cover teachers and cannot leave the class
unattended.

I've got a replacement pen, it works, and I've sorted the projector remote
out so it can be switched on and off with that again - I think the reason
it is squint is that people have been using the power button!

Thanks

We have two ipads at school which are requesting apple id's as they were a
gift from parents.
We would like to use them THIS weekend purely to accept donations via sum
up, towards restoring some of our log books in school which are a record of
what happened when the school first opened.
Can they be set up to use in school or can you think of another way we can
use the sum up app?
You are probably best speaking to Josh Burnell directly as he knows what he
is trying to do. His email is josh.burnell@fishergateschool.com

Thank you

Hi Ruth

The monitor has gone into rainbow mode again but the board is still working thankfully.

The Applied Law exams are OneDrive submissions.
It is a printed submission and I will therefore need a printer in the sixth

I have attached seating plans for the rooms being used.  Pease can you
ensure these computers are working and that the accounts can be allocated
to the machines.  For Exams 3 we will use the teacher PC I believe.

I have sent this to Jo Kitney to double check that I have covered all exams
