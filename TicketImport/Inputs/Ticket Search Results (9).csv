I saw that the USB ports on the laptops are due to be deactivated soon
for security reasons. However I use all 3 ports on my laptop on a daily
basis. I use 1 port for my mouse, 1 port for my keyboard and the third port
is used for my headset which I use for cloudya phone calls when in the
office.

Is it possible for my USB ports to remain active please? Otherwise can you
let me know of an alternative way to plug in my mouse, keyboard and
headset without using the USB ports please?

,T20231027.0229,Re: Deactivation of USB Ports,"I would add to this that some of our staff, who are not regular computer
users, cannot use a chromebook touchpad for their training etc without a
mouse plugged in, as they find the scrolling etc problematic.

I use a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse with my laptop and would
struggle to complete my day to day tasks without these items, as intensive
data work on spreadsheets etc is much more difficult trying to select and
scroll with a touchpad.

It says that USB ports on desktops will be deactivated (see article below).

I have a visualizer camera, a microphone, a clicker and a radio plugged in

Just wondering if these will still work? Or if not, could my USB ports not

,T20231027.0143,Re: Website,"From Andrew McGlen <andrew@ryedaleweb.com>: Hi,

Just to clairy, the website is updating correctly but people inside of the
school network seem to have to wait considerably longer to see the updated
version than those accessing the site outside of the network. This seems to
have become more pronounced recently leading me to suspect there may have
been a change to the internal caching. This same concern was also raised by
another Ebor school recently where those outside the the school network
would see updates almost immediately but those within school would still be
seeing a cached version of the website.

This is Josh Burnell from Fishergate. I’ve been speaking with Tina and
Debbie about updating the school website. I would really like to design a
new site from scratch using Wix. I have lots of experience running a Wix
site with my own music business outside of teaching.

Do you think this would I be possible / ok for us to do? And if so, do you
know how we would go about cancelling the old website so we are not paying
twice?

If we go ahead with this, I would design the website, then transfer the
domain once it is finished.

Many thanks,

Josh

that they can't access the Google Classroom for the class, even though when
I look down the list of students in the Classroom they are all listed. I'm
wondering if it's something to do with the fact that they joined the class
later? The four students who weren't originally members of the class are:

- Cristina Woodward
- Kelsey Jones
- Tia McHale
- Jessia Opara

Please could you help?

Many thanks,

Simon

I recently attended the etc and was really impressed with Adobe Express and
wondered if we could have this deployed in Huntington Primary Academy?

,T20231027.0024,Re: Website customer message,"Hi Jandi,

Could you please tell me what has happened to call 1338106. It seems to
have been closed. I still can't use my card or have an update. This would
be really helpful in clearing the issue.

The silence about this call/issue is deafening from Arena. From my point of
view I have to deal with the issue everytime I print. We have given you
plenty of time to look into this call and I still have not got an update.
All I want to know is how it can be fixed and by who.

Regards

Pete

We need some help with how we give information to supply teachers. When I
recently visited a different school, they had a school supply gmail account
set up where teachers could just email the necessary resources for the day.

When the supply teacher logged into the Chrome book, the gmail account was
automatically signed in.

Is this something that we can do?

,T20231026.0243,The bug is back,"Hi

Really sorry but the Microsoft bug is back on my computers. It's been fine since it was sorted last week but has returned. When I went to use the computer in J12 for form today, it wouldn't load any of my desk top but it did let me run office 365 through the internet.

When I came down to PO3 and signed on all the duplicate icons were back and the same has happened in PO2 and in the drama office. I have been able to get on to the internet but it's all taking a long time and I don't want 30,000 duplicates again.

Would someone be able to come and sort tomorrow?

Thanks
Ruth

Hi Tracey,



Hope you are well.



I have been asked to send over the attached network form for completion
ahead of the installation of your printer.

Please can you or your IT dept complete and return to me when possible so
we can preconfigure the machines prior to install.


This will minimize disruption and downtime at installation.

If you have any question or require any assistance completing the form,
please contact me.



Thanks,

John

Hadley is most concerned as believes he needs this for his half term

Hope you are well.

There is still a significant issue in our Y5 classroom with the wifi and
internet connection. We have a child that is dependent on technology to be
able to communicate effectively.  Devices often just don't connect at all
and we have to walk down the corridor with them to try to connect.

Is this something you can help with please?

Thank you

I am having issues with my laptop.

It does not hold charge and will close down/shut down if unplugged. Due to my role as SEND Teacher, I am conducting observations of children around school and am finding it extremely difficult to use without having to plug it in in each classroom which causes wires to be draped around children etc causing hazards. It is also very large and heavy.

Please could you look into this and if necessary, arrange for a new device.

Thanks

,T20231026.0066,Automatic time setting on school computers and server,"Hi,

I've noticed that there is an issue with some of the computers in school displaying the incorrect time.  Whilst in itself it's not a huge issue, I think it is preventing us from accessing some of the online services we subscribe to.  For example, if I use a computer with the correct time, I am able to access FFT Aspire but not on the one where the time is incorrect.

Is there a way that the correct time can be set remotely?

Thanks

I've had a new laptop delivered and set up with our network today by one of your technicians but there appear to be a couple of issues:


  1.   There is no option to connect to a Wi-Fi network and when I run a troubleshooter, it appears there is a hardware problem.
  2.   The sound is stuck on mute and I can't find a way of getting it to play any sounds.  Have tried headphones but with no success.

Thanks

Hi Sarah



I suspect Zack Craven was sending Wes Malarkey inappropriate images during P3 today. I saw Wes looking at an image with one finger up and he hinted that it was Zac who sent it to him.



Do we have a system for logging misuse of ICT? Do you think this incident needs further investigation. There used to be a button on SIMS for this.



Thank you for letting me know

,T20231025.0156,Re: Website customer message,"Hi,

Thanks for your email.

Call Ref 2347947 is the paper jam for today. I know that this call will be
seen to and an engineer will arrive within the SLA. Which is the service we
have always got from yourselves.

However, the call Ref 1338106 logged by Giles (School IT engineer) was
logged on the 16/10/23 allocated on the 17/10/23 is still open? I spoke to
him yesterday and he had no response. It's 25/10/23 today. This issue has
been ongoing since 6/09/23 and your printer engineers have been out and
looked at this machine and it is still not working as it was before. This
issue needs to be pushed back to second line or software support. Contact
needs to be made and looked into why this printer is not working properly
and if required that all parties need to come together and
resolve the issue so be it. We have managed the printer in the best we can
in a professional manner (until this morning). We are only the operators
and have no way of making this happen unless some picks up the phone and
talks to Giles and see what solution can be made.

I believe 36 days is far too long to have this issue outstanding.

Please email me and let me know what your plan is going forward for Call
Ref 1338106.

Regards

Pete

,T20231025.0022,GCSEPod Videos,"Hi,

I created a ticket a week or so ago for GCSEPod URLs to be unblocked. The site works but the videos on the website don't play on the kid's iPads, and they need it for half term. I've checked the settings on the Smoothwall browser and nothing in there is blocking video playback. ALSO in some cases, photos don't load at all on any site. Some settings must need changing somewhere but I'm not sure it's a filtering issue as it works on desktops around the school.

Need this looking at as a matter of urgency.

Thanks

Don't know if you can help but I have noticed that the staff are not
updating on the library system. This has not happened for a while but the
students are up to date including photos.

Do you know why this might be happening, they pull the info from SIMs so I
don't know if there is a block or something for staff.

I know it hasn't been done for a while because Kathi isn't showing there.

Any help would be appreciated

Thank you very much!

Class 22 - Amy Swan's class have asked if you could connect the interview
ports in their classroom to their moved computers, they told me as they're
the moving on zone that this needs doing everytime they move a PC. they
will have already set up the PC so it just needs connecting to the
internet. This is 2nd hand information if this make sense,

,T20231024.0034,Downloading powerpoints in chrome,"Hi, I'm having some issues with downloading powerpoints from our online
textbook in science (https://www.pearsonactivelearn.com/). It has always
been that when I clicked on 'download' the powerpoint would automatiacally
save to my downloads folder as a powerpoint file that I could then open in
powerpoint but now it only opens it in a new window (see screen shot below)
and I can't then download it or save or open it in powerpoint. I have the
option to open it in google slides but that then loses all the formatting
which is frustrating. I've searched online and it would appear that this
should be a setting in the advanced settings in chrome but I don't seem to
have those options. Is this something you can help with? If this doesn't
make sense I'll try and find Ben in person but I know he's very busy with
the smoothwall rollout.
Thanks

I wondered if you could help me please? I've recently returned to work at
Park Grove Primary and I'm using a Supply Teacher laptop until a new
computer arrives for me. I'm unable to download files both at home and at
school. Is there something I need to do to enable this? I think it happened
once before to me when I had too many files and had to delete some so it
could be the same issue or something else.

Many thanks,

I was unable to log on to vhost03 and so I restarted it, hoping that this

problem and I am unable to login to it as the domain is unavailable and I
don't have a local account.

So i am now completely stuck.

Hi James



We now have the details for this supply cover on SIMS.  Apparently their name is Angela Rotard and she is on as AR2 on SIMS.



Can you please sort an email address and log-in and send to us all so that Louise can sort Classcharts and SIMs log-ins.



Emma – any idea why she calls herself Millie Wilde?  Her documentation and ID is definitely in the name of Angela Rotard.

Hi Helen & Susan,



I understand Millie will be joining us on Monday, but I can't see her on sims to be able to create her logins.



Please can you let James know when she has been added, so that he can create a login.



James - please can you let Louise, Emma Dinsdale and I have her email address and login as soon as it is created.



I've copied Louise, in case this is not resolved today.



Thanks,

There are some timetable changes and switches that Mike has made to try and create blocks of lessons so that it was a more effective timetable for someone to pick up. Millie will on the whole follow Laura's original HSC timetable, but with some slight alterations.



Mike has the spreadsheet with everything on but in summary the changes that need making are:



  *   Millie picks up my 12Q HSC Double Monday p1
  *   I am now teaching 13Q HSC Monday p1 in J14- this is a new lesson- out of the Q blocks. They will no longer have a lesson Thursday p5
  *   Millie will be taking my 10B HSC lessons on a Monday and Wednesday p4 in J21
  *   I will be taking Laura's 10C HSC lessons on a Wednesday p3 and Thursday p5 in J21
  *   I will continue with 10B HSC on Friday p1- but in J14
  *   13S HSC have been re-roomed Friday p1 to L13

Hope this makes sense,



Emma

I used to have the Staff Training as a link on my desktop so that I could add files, but it has disappeared when computers were re-set in the summer.

The original link was:  network/HS-DATA/StaffS/staff.training/Documents/Desktop/Offline Resource

Please can you sort this for me as I can't even swap user now so that I can go in.

We now have the details for this supply cover on SIMS.  Apparently their name is Angela Rotard and she is on as AR2 on SIMS.

Can you please sort an email address and log-in and send to us all so that Louise can sort Classcharts and SIMs log-ins.

Emma - any idea why she calls herself Millie Wilde?  Her documentation and ID is definitely in the name of Angela Rotard.

Hi Helen & Susan,

I understand Millie will be joining us on Monday, but I can't see her on sims to be able to create her logins.

Please can you let James know when she has been added, so that he can create a login.

James - please can you let Louise, Emma Dinsdale and I have her email address and login as soon as it is created.

I've copied Louise, in case this is not resolved today.

Thanks,

,T20231023.0170,Majority of Yr11 Class can't access Google Classroom - Room H13,"Hello,

The majority of the Yr11 Class I'm covering can't access Google Classroom.
They're saying it is due to a recent update to their ipads (smoothwall),
and they don't know their passwords for Google Classroom.

These are the instructions for the cover lesson:

Your mocks start after half term.

There are MANY revision resources available on google classroom for you to
choose from.

There are revision booklets for each of biology, chemistry and physics (you
must download these first to use them).

There are revision checklists, and revision placemats.

You should work independently, focussing revision on topics that you
personally need.

I have instructed the students to revise from their books and the
science textbooks. Nevertheless, it would be good if they could access
Google Classroom this lesson - is there any way this could be done?

Sorry to bother you with this.

Many thanks and kind regards,

Subject: Account issue following MFA

Hi Tom

Hoping you can help very easily on this one.  A few staff, myself included, have noticed today that we have been signed out of our google accounts and had to re-verify to get back in.

One member of staff, Emily Aitken, deleted the MFA app from her phone after completing the sync process due to not having sufficient storage on her phone, but I think it's caused an issue now.  When she goes to sign in, the computer is telling her a code has been sent to the phone app.  However, nothing is popping back up on the phone app for her to type the code into to authenticate.  I think she probably needs to wipe her account and go through the initial QR code set up part again?

What do you think?

Currently she can't access her account, and she's a class teacher, so we need a workaround fast.  I did explain that if she doesn't have the space on her phone for the app, then we can set it up to send a text instead.

Kind regards
Laura

Hi Chris

I’m told your account should work now, presumably with the password you
were originally given. The problem was to do with two factor authentication
which should not be applied to governors’ account but was to yours.

Let me know if it still proves problematic.

Best wishes

,T20231023.0065,Computer issue,"Good morning

I have been having an issue with my computer, when I am in a document this
could be excel word or any doc the screen is occasionally locking and I
cannot click off it, minimise or anything. The only way of coming out of it
is to restart the computer. I did call last week and Marcus had a look
remotely and the day after it seemed ok but it is starting to lock up again
and has done it twice already this morning.

Also please can I enquire about an ipad login issue for Ruth Lyons,
Ruth said she cannot get on to the ipad using the Ebor wifi and that Vital
have set something up on her ipad previously but this is now not working,
Ruth has tried to log in using the Childrens Centre password and has
managed to get on but cannot do anything.

Please can you look into these for me.

Many thanks

,T20231023.0039,[Ticket ID: 397696] Website block - Knavesmire Primary School,"From Talk Straight General Enquiries <hello@talk-straight.com>: Dear Vital York,

I have ccd your support email on to this ticket thread to get your assistance.

A request came in in regards to blocking a games website for Knavesmire Primary School, which was done on our end.
Whilst troubleshooting I found that the caller on the phone rsmith1@NSW-01789@OVLP19 was on an older version of Netsweeper (Web filtering). I'm not sure if the entire school is on an older version of netsweeper.

Our request to you is if you can download the latest netsweeper agent (via the we transfer link provided below) and deploy on to rsmith1@NSW-01789@OVLP19 and then make sure the school is up to date with the latest filtering agent.

We transfer link: https://we.tl/t-93lAwjRegf

Hi Tim.

As you know we were without internet at Patrington Thursday & Friday & both
talk straight & vital have been involved with trying to sort this.
We’ve just been in to check this afternoon & there is still no internet, so
it doesn’t bode well for tomorrow.
Just thought I’d keep you in the loop.

Hi Quizizz Educator,



This is to inform you about the upcoming Google Workspace for Education
policy changes that may impact your students' ability to access Quizizz
after *October 23, 2023*.

Here is everything you need to know to avoid interruption in your Quizizz
experience due to these changes.



*Who is impacted?*



If your school has school-administered Google accounts for students, you
may be impacted by Google’s changes. *However, this does not impact you if
your school does not use school-administered Google accounts for students.*



*What’s happening?*



Starting October 23, 2023, Google Workspace for Education is changing its
privacy settings. Google users designated as under 18 won’t be able to use
their school-administered Google credentials to access teacher-favorite
tools like Quizizz unless a Google Workspace administrator takes action.



*What do I need to do?*



To avoid potential disruption for your students, it’s critical that your
school marks Quizizz as trusted in Google Workspace for Education.

with your school IT department to ensure your students can log into Quizizz
with their school-administered Google credentials. Only the Google
Workspace for Education administrator can mark Quizizz as trusted.



*Is anything changing about Quizizz? *



Quizizz is not changing any of our policies. *Students can always join a
quiz or lesson through an internet browser without signing in using their
school-administered Google credentials (e.g. with a join code).*

We seem to have a number of Chromebooks where they can’t connect to the

When you click on a Wi-Fi connection it comes up with the password blank or
‘bad password’. I have the password for the SMCCATwifi but is this the
right one that we should be using? Or should we connect them to SMCCAT-PSK?
Or does it not matter?

Can you please advise how to resolve this?

Thank you again,

I haven't yet been able to get logged on with my Ebor Academy email, as the

am hoping to get this sorted with them. Would it be possible for it to be

Hi Sarah,

Sam Tonks doesn't work for Ebor Academy Trust anymore and I have taken over
her role. Please feel free to contact me if you have any problems in the
future.

You were sent login details to the HR system, iTrent to your Ebor Academy
Trust email address on 02.10.2023. Did you manage to log in there
successfully?

Once you have logged into the HR System click on Staff Learning Hub on the
dashboard, then click on the Staff Learning Hub link to take you to another
login screen. Once you login here you should be able to access your
training.

Please log on to the HR system, iTrent using the link in here:
https://ce0854li.webitrent.com/ce0854li_ess/ess/dist/#/login?page=login

I hope this helps but please let me know if you are still having problems
accessing the training.

Kind regards

Subject: HSC Timetable changes

Hi Claire,

Millie Wilde starts with us on Monday to shadow Laura, she will officially start picking up HSC lessons when we return after half term.

There are some timetable changes and switches that Mike has made to try and create blocks of lessons so that it was a more effective timetable for someone to pick up. Millie will on the whole follow Laura's original HSC timetable, but with some slight alterations.

Mike has the spreadsheet with everything on but in summary the changes that need making are:


  *   Millie picks up my 12Q HSC Double Monday p1
  *   I am now teaching 13Q HSC Monday p1 in J14- this is a new lesson- out of the Q blocks. They will no longer have a lesson Thursday p5
  *   Millie will be taking my 10B HSC lessons on a Monday and Wednesday p4 in J21
  *   I will be taking Laura's 10C HSC lessons on a Wednesday p3 and Thursday p5 in J21
  *   I will continue with 10B HSC on Friday p1- but in J14
  *   13S HSC have been re-roomed Friday p1 to L13

Hope this makes sense,

Emma

,T20231020.0042,Laptop - Winzip,"Hi,

Wondering if someone can help. I seem to have had a free trial of WinZip on
my laptop at some point. As such, anytime I now try and open a folder, it
tries to take me through that (as per the photo below). I have to right
click to get to Windows Explorer instead.

Is there a way of removing any trace of WinZip from my laptop?

Thanks,
Hannah

I am still unable to access the remote desktop from my laptop. I can access
it on a PC in school but this is not always possible and I need to be able
to access it on my laptop. We spoke to someone from Vital over the phone (I
think it was Joe) on Wednesday about this issue and was told that it's an
issue with my laptop. He said Vital would look into it and work on it in
the background however, I've tried to log on to it this morning and it's
still saying that I am blocked. Please can this be resolved ASAP?

I have found a Ruth very close to tears this morning. Her log in for her computer in po2 is still causing issues. She says she has done everything you have told her to, she came in early to set up her lesson only to find the computer not playing ball.

I have logged in for her on my account so she is ready to go for period 1. But she 'somehow' needs this sorting out as it is having an impact on her wellbeing.  She is school until lunchtime.

Many thanks
Beth

Please can you give the following people their access back to Microsoft
Helen Brown
Anthony David
Lauren Duffill
Alice Tiffany

Everyone who you fixed last month is now expiring again. Some of us will
re-expire again in the half term holiday.
Have you got a list of who you fixed so you can re-fix them rather than us
having to wait until they need microsoft and then contact you to fix it?

Thank you

Kind regards

Enable Flip in your Google Admin Settings by Oct. 23
Hi Ms,
We're checking in to see how it's going. Were you able to contact your IT
department to ensure Flip is allowed in your settings?

We are just days away from the Google Workspace for Education change now,
and really want to be sure you and your students have access to Flip.
*If your IT admin does not take action and allow Flip for you and your
students in the Google Admin settings, you will not be able to access Flip
starting on October 23.*
Flip is a verified Google app, and it will only take a few minutes to
ensure you can maintain access to Flip. You can share this article
<https://go.flip.com/NzkwLUhWVy02NDcAAAGO53gS7KkTb8VbNzUkTyJQu7fW1CP3Hg7AjXwoC5g5Hgx3CCm0isq8o20pM-xLJvwCeALf4Fc=>
with your IT administrator to guide them through the steps.
Need help? Log into Flip and reach out to our support team at this link
<https://go.flip.com/NzkwLUhWVy02NDcAAAGO53gS7HCRVp5fibcrvGi-FpOg7Vsxi4ddNYltZSLWyhb-efNAlvkLlnqVqbF-weTYL9AfC0A=>,
or by clicking on the question mark in the upper right corner of the app
and selecting ""Improve Flip"".
If you have already taken this action, you're all set and can disregard our
emails about this matter.

on a computer I told the teacher who asked for them that it’s not our job
it’s an IT job as it’s to do with computers and we don’t have anything to
do with computers.then she replied you said it’s not your job it the site
staffs job. Since when is anything to do with computers a site team job
it’s your job. You have done thing like this before saying it’s our job and
it is your job. I’ve told her I’m not doing it because it’s your job so
it’s still to do.

,T20231019.0231,Re: New starter,"Starting on Monday, I *think* mum and dad are together - do you know
Hannah?

Alexis - I think A band and Form RGI might be the best bet. My only concern
is we ideally don't want too many more new starters going into 9a2 as there
have been quite a few so 9a3 might be better - he is EAL with not great
English and might struggle at first. 9a2 across most subjects is a very
rocky class for an EAL student/for teachers to be picking up.

Thanks,
Jessa

Hey Tracy,

Could you log this as a behaviour in lesson on class charts? If they do
something like this again I would say they need to come off the computers
and have a ban from using them for a lesson in which they just copy things
out/work on worksheets? Is that doable as a sanction?

NYCC said they can't see anything wrong with the network, and they think it's the server. They don't have an on site server, so it can't be that? I can't imagine it's a loop as networked PCs are OK.

My white board is not working, still. It has been like this for quite some
time now and is still not being fixed. Technicians came and took photos of
it, but have not been able to fix it yet. This is making it increasingly
difficult for teachers to teach their lessons as they have to use a laptop
and have students around a table, which does not work in our setting.
Please can this be fixed as a matter of urgency.

,T20231019.0058,Saving to the One drive,"Hi James

I had the meeting with the staff about L Drive use this morning and most are effectively using the One Drive but they reported and issue we need to fix. Both Garry and Mark have had instance where students have save to their One Drive on a computer and when they have moved to another computer they work wasn't there. However, when they went back to the computer they originally had the work on it was there.

Please can you look into this. Garry and Mark will be able to tell you which rooms this happened in.

Thanks
Sarah

Hello all

We have assessment in PSHE next week if anyone could support in loaning me
a set of chrome books for the day that would be great. these are the
lessons I needs chrome books next week:

Monday 23rd lesson 1,2,5
Tuesday 24th lesson 2,3,4,5,
Wednesday 25th lesson 1,2, 4,5
Thursday 26th lesson 3
Friday 27th lesson 1,2,3,4

I hope some of you can support me with getting our online assessments
fulfilled in PSHE. That would be great. we will require them for about
20mins every lesson. but if anyone doesn't have their trolley booked out
next week I would love to borrow them for the day would make it easier if
possible.

look forward to hearing from you soon

Hi Quizizz Educator,



This is to inform you about the upcoming Google Workspace for Education
policy changes that may impact your students' ability to access Quizizz
after *October 23, 2023*.

Here is everything you need to know to avoid interruption in your Quizizz
experience due to these changes.



*Who is impacted?*



If your school has school-administered Google accounts for students, you
may be impacted by Google’s changes. *However, this does not impact you if
your school does not use school-administered Google accounts for students.*



*What’s happening?*



Starting October 23, 2023, Google Workspace for Education is changing its
privacy settings. Google users designated as under 18 won’t be able to use
their school-administered Google credentials to access teacher-favorite
tools like Quizizz unless a Google Workspace administrator takes action.



*What do I need to do?*



To avoid potential disruption for your students, it’s critical that your

Hi Quizizz Educator,



This is to inform you about the upcoming Google Workspace for Education
policy changes that may impact your students' ability to access Quizizz
after *October 23, 2023*.

Here is everything you need to know to avoid interruption in your Quizizz
experience due to these changes.



*Who is impacted?*



If your school has school-administered Google accounts for students, you
may be impacted by Google’s changes. *However, this does not impact you if
your school does not use school-administered Google accounts for students.*



*What’s happening?*



Starting October 23, 2023, Google Workspace for Education is changing its
privacy settings. Google users designated as under 18 won’t be able to use
their school-administered Google credentials to access teacher-favorite
tools like Quizizz unless a Google Workspace administrator takes action.



*What do I need to do?*



To avoid potential disruption for your students, it’s critical that your
school marks Quizizz as trusted in Google Workspace for Education.

Hi Gill

Chris Keeler is having problems accessing his PMAT email as the password is
not recognised. This seems to have been an issue with other new governors
recently. Please could you ask someone at Vital to contact him? He has
given permission for me to share his mobile number which is: 07425597494.

Thanks

Hi Chris,

ACTION REQUIRED: Review and confirm your third-party app settings for
Screencastify by October 23, 2023 in the Google Admin Console, or your
organization may lose access to Screencastify.



We are reaching out with an important update regarding Google SSO.



To protect student data privacy, Google will restrict access to third-party
applications (including Screencastify) for students under the age of 18
unless the admin confirms access in the Google Admin Console.



*Admins need to ensure Screencastify is marked as a trusted app in Google
by October 23, 2023, or your organization may lose access to Screencastify.
Follow these i**nstructions for Confirming Screencastify as a Trusted App
for Google SSO:*



1. Log into Google Admin Console as an administrator

2. Navigate to the App access control card.

3. Click Review apps and select Screencastify.

4. Click Configure access.

5. Confirm Screencastify is set to Trust. Review the confirmation
information, then click Confirm.

,T20231018.0289,Printers,"Hello

Since moving to the Pathfinder system we now have two printer choices
available, one called colour and the other mono.  How does this work if
someone is printing a black and white document but chooses the colour
printer by accident, will it count as a colour print?

Each colour print costs about 10 times as much as a black and white print
and we used to have printing set up so that it defaulted to black and white
and kept our costs down.  I'm concerned that with the new setup, our costs
are going to increase without a good reason.

Kind regards

Hi Kat,



I am sure you are in the right place. For any student you have the option
of the mainstream version of the FSQ (in case you have sighted, KS3) or
also for those with significant learning difficulties (EHCP and serious
only) the SEND version of the FSQ

Here’s the link to the main article….first bit is prep by the IT manager
and then below you will see screenshots

If you would prefer a quick demo let me know some times and I’ll try and
help

Hi Philipa,



Please can I ask you a question? I would like to send the link to the FSQ
to students, however, where it asks which questionnaire would I like to
send the two options are transition from KS3 and SEND, nothing about FSQ.
Am I in the wrong place?

HPA (only the Huntington Headteacher can have access head@hpa.pmat.academy)

It's vital that these are restricted only to the schools' Headteacher as

,T20231018.0134,Phone query,"Good morning

We are having a problem with one of our phones not working. The handset is
on and there is a tone but calls are not going through either incoming or
outgoing, I have unplugged it and plugged it back in but it is still not
working.

The phone is also on a wall hanging quite precariously on a screw, I tried
to log this with Sewells who said that the phone needs a backplate so that
it can be hung correctly and that this is something that needs raising with
you.

Are you able to advise or pop in to have a look?

Many thanks

Hello,
Jake Danials was present in your meeting lesson in December 2023. This
means Lianna Anne was also involved in a math lesson previously from
Eastfield Park. Why am i able to grasp the metaphorical understanding of
martin's GCSE parentpay, when clearly you cannot form 1+1 in a
symmetrical 50 degree wheelspin, vertically. How come that one time you
didnt do that other time which you didnt do, but that other time you did;
but the other year you did do it.

Me

,T20231018.0053,Projection and computer 106,"Morning,
My monitor is projected on to my whiteboard (as a synched screen), and I
don't know how to change it back so it's technically two screens.
Also my monitor is not displaying a full screen a is just a square rather
than filling the full space.

There is also a bit of a lag on mouse/typing but no doubt will not do this
when you look at it.
Thanks

 Our research shows that the file being executed belongs to an application that several of our security vendors have flagged as malicious, due to this we do not recommed the use of it in your environment, the process was terminated but the manual elimination on the file stills needs to be performed on the host. We recommend talking with the user as at times this type of malware gets installed without the user's informed knowledge while browsing through an insecure website or if they were trying to install something from an unauthorized source. 
 Please let us know if there is anything else we can further assist you with. Best Regards.

Hi
One of my Governors has asked if you could change her Mrs to Ms it is Ruth
Butterworth.
I have also noticed that one of my other Governors Sam Battwood comes
through as Ms and he is Mr and one of my members of staff Justine Burroughs
comes through as Mr and she is Mrs.
Just while I'm on Michelle Moneypenny comes through as Michelle Whittaker,
despite her email being Moneypenny so if that could also be changed that
would be great.

From previous conversations with yourself and Giles I thought that we had
agreed that seclusion would have a full chromebook trolley and the smaller
trolley was going to be the exams trolley. If this isn't your understanding
please can you put this into place asap as it's been a challenge for the
seclusion/AP team as they do not have enough chromebooks when they are at
peak numbers. We have the spare trolley so I hope we can put this into
place this week. Please let me know a timeframe as soon as you can.

Thanks

They have done Galileo before, so we’ll have to catch up on Newton next time. The videos are the ones we use across the Dept for these lessons, so not sure why they didn’t work.

There are videos for my next lesson, p3, if I don’t make it back. I’ve copied in James from Vital for advice and help so that the videos work.

James, please see the email below from
David. The videos for p3 have been sent to all.cover work and are also YouTube links . Have you got any advice?

Hi Kate,



Unfortunately, where were some technical issues playing the videos. There was a  network error message saying I could not get outside the school firewall to access youtube. It asked for a name/passwd. I tried mine and it did not work.



There was a trainee assistant in the room who sought advice and she was told to continue the lesson but this time use the print out to research Gallileo. I got the class to do a chart for Gallileo in their exercise book (on a new page) with two columns (discoveries/inventions vs conflict with authorities).



I hope this is OK. It was the best I could do in the circumstances…

Good morning



Apologies this is so close to the lesson. The sheets needed are on the desk in the classroom, students have their books. Any absent last time, their books will be at the back of the room on the shelf.



Lesson is here: [https://res-h3.public.cdn.office.net/assets/mail/file-icon/png/pptx_16x16.png] KEH Cover 17th October.pptx<https://huntingtonschool.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/P-DriveResourceFolders/EW3SP6GOV2xMtFVgxMGwZzwBxJ9yO1AiYOIAg1Wk2dyXuQ?e=dDeGd7> Y8 P1

Please follow the slides- the students should complete the work independently.



I have added a couple of short revision tasks at the end, if they get through the body of the work.



Thanks

Could you recommend a Chrome extension to allow children to speak and it
turns their words into text. I thought we already had this but I can not
find it. We already use Read Write but would like one for speech to text.
If there is one, could you enable it for Y6 at Acomb Primary School?

,T20231016.0212,Email names,"Afternoon,

I was wondering how difficult a job it would be to alter my name on the
email system to say 'Mrs J Turnbull' instead of just 'J Turnbull' and if it
would be possible please? A number of students have emailed me instead of
Nick (n.turnbull) recently, or have emailed neither as they weren't sure
which one to pick when they type 'turnbull' into the 'To' box and I am
thinking that where there are 2 staff with the same surname whether we
could have our title on there to make it clearer who is who please.

Thanks

,T20231016.0133,"Smoothwall Over Blocking - Ads Category, PDFs","Hello Vital.

It seems that Smoothwall is treating some PDF files as adverts today.
I've seen issues with staff uploading PDF files to google drive via the
webpage and also downloading PDF files from the following websites:

epeponline.co.uk
business-stream.co.uk

I've put them both in HTTPS bypass to fix the issue for users for now.

Is it just us?

Heworth Sign in printer has disconnected again so we will need someone to
come and look at this if possible.

Also the ipad seems to be on all the time and a member of staff said you
can see it shining through the door at night. Is there any way we can set a
timer on it so the screen turns off after so long of not being used?

Dear Wendy
I believe there is another N Thompson within ebor.
Since the start of term I have been receiving so many emails meant for the
other N Thompson. Each time I have emailed saying that the emails have been
sent to the wrong person. The most recent has been two emails this evening.
Is there any way to make our email addresses more different or maybe just a
reminder message about the correct email address for the other N Thompson?
I wouldn’t want the other N Thompson to miss something important.
Kind regards

Thank you for getting my laptop set up. I was wondering if you could please
help me with adding the St Lawrence's CE Primary School (mono and colour)
printers to the laptop- currently whenever I try to print anything to one
of the school printers, it asks me to input an admin username and password
to add the printer. I have tried using my own log in details and it does
not seem to accept this. Any help would be appreciated.

Hi Jonathan,

I reached out to Vital again about the Remote Desktop issues on Friday, and haven't heard back I'm assuming they just haven't had chance to look at the issue yet! I'll let you know if I hear more. As for the room booking system, there were issues on Friday , however they seemed to only be affecting a small number of people and began to resolve themselves after I contacted RBS, however it seems those issues have returned and while they don't match what you;re colleague was saying they could be related, so I'll reach out to them.

Thanks,

Kyle

Good morning

There seems to be a continued issue with remote access from home.

RD web client was working but then stopped yesterday evening.
RD web access - where you can copy and paste things without any issues has not been working for over a week now.

Is this also an issue - a colleague said this was not working last night either so more than 15 mins.

Thanks
Jonathan

email address, although I think the email address is outdated. I think it
would be a question for IT/Holly as to how to differentiate which Eleanor

RD web client was working but then stopped yesterday evening.
RD web access - where you can copy and paste things without any issues has
not been working for over a week now.

Is this also an issue - a colleague said this was not working last night
either so more than 15 mins.

Thanks
Jonathan

To: IT Support IT Support <itsupport@gps.hslt.academy>


Hi Andrew,

Would it be possible to set up a projector and screen in the gym ready for
12.30pm start on Monday 16th October?

We have an event called ""restart a heart"" all day and will use the assembly
hall  for all the other sessions but the assembly hall is needed for
lunchtime so we will move to the gym lesson 4 - is that possible?? (I have
checked that we can use the gym with AWO).

Thanks
Catherine

I hope you are having a good weekend. Thanks so much for my new ipad. I love it!

Please can you add the following apps to my ipad? Ipad 1909 but I think the others would probably like them too if you could put them on them all of our ipads please?

- YouTube for showing the kids skill demos eg gymnastics vault handspring
-BaM Video Delay- so good for every sport for self assessment (as you can delay watching your own performance)
- apple music if possible?
- Google Drive
- Google Docs (I have all of my lesson plans saved on these two)

Thanks so much for your help

She has done this, but upon scanning the QR code again, it says that the

Morning,
one of the keyboards in C09 has been vandalised : PC 23041.
Using the cameras could we find who did it? It must look obvious that they are popping the keys out.
It was ok last time I was in here.

Subject: Updates on pupils



Hi Beth



For some reason I am regularly not receiving important updates on pupils I teach.  It has happened 3 times recently (that I know of).  Twice with separate year 7 pupils - Sally got the email & when I've says something she's referred to email), & most recently with a year 8.



Is there please someone we can inform/highlight to say that when important pupil emails are sent, often they have more than one science teacher (not just form tutor as per staff briefing)?  To be clear it is happening on classes where I am the lead teacher too... so I really don't know why I'm getting missed off!



Thank you!



Abi

Hello,

Today I will be processing a SIMS update, required to fix pending database
issues. The updates will run at 3.15 PM and take roughly 30 minutes to
complete.

Please can I ask all staff to ensure and remain logged out of SIMS – I will
email as soon as the updates have been applied.

Thank you

Any use for the comms cabinet removed from the support centre?
I think it's too big to use anywhere - would Vital want it?
If not, the contractor will skip it, I just need to let them know.

,T20231012.0221,Re:[## 113943 ##] New EU CrowdStrike Incident - Hope Sentamu Learning Trust,"From Diego Garcia <tickets@cyberclan.com>: Hi Hope Sentamu Team, 
 
 CrowdStrike detected the execution of a potentially malicious file. The process has been terminated and the file is not quarantined. 
 Classification:A process launched with a command line associated with known malware. Investigate the process tree. Date/Time:Oct. 12, 2023 09:28:47 local time, (2023-10-12 13:28:47 UTC) Host: ASA-SD-G05-11 User: HLT\19asa-ck13 Filename: SpeedAutoClicker.exe File Type: executable. File Path: ""C:\Users\19asa-ck13\AppData\Local\Temp\Tempbe0e191f-9132-483a-8526-0d1cd127d3ba_SpeedAutoClicker-v1.6.2.zip\SpeedAutoClicker.exe""
 
 Our research shows that the file being executed belongs to an application that several of our security vendors have flagged as malicious, due to this we do not recommed the use of it in your environment, the process was terminated but the manual elimination on the file stills needs to be performed on the host. We recommend talking with the user as at times this type of malware gets installed without the user's informed knowledge while browsing through an insecure website or if they were trying to install something from an unauthorized source. 
 Please let us know if there is anything else we can further assist you with. Best Regards.

I have had the following message from a sixth pupil trying to complete
assignment work on Fusion in the AHS sixth form library...

*Hi miss, the computers in the sixth form library have stopped being able
to run Fusion as the latest update needed to be able to use fusion is too
large for the available disk space. It throws up an error message saying
that 5.34GB needs to be freed up in order to download the update.  *

Please could someone in IT look at this?
Many thanks,

Good morning Lucy
I hope you’re well.
I was wondering if it’s possible to reset my email password as I can’t
access it on my laptop and when I tried it said contact your provider. I
can get it on my phone as the password is saved but I can’t see it.
Any help you can give would be very much appreciated

Many thanks

HI Chris,

As you know, Rich our Site Lead is due to leave us next week.

Paul has queried how we might re-direct Rich's email as typically we would
take him off the system but do not want to lose access to this over a
temporary period.

I just wanted to give you the heads up that he may request how this can be

Any advice would be appreciated.

Hello,

I have noticed that one of the children in my class has the name written incorrectly in her login, my fault sorry. The child is Lilian Reed. Her login has two 'l's in the middle instead of one.

It should be Lilian Reed.

Is this something you can change?

Hi Angela,

Thanks for getting in touch,

There has recently been an issue where SIMS photos aren't syncing
correctly. Wonde has informed us that SIMS has released a patch to resolve
this and has advised that the schools use this to rectify the issue.  The
SIMS Patch Number you'll need to install/update is 28262. You should be
able to do this in SIMS directly but if not, please contact SIMS Support so
they can provide you with this.

Once updated, please let us know so we can run the sync again.


Best wishes,

*Zoe*

Could you have a look and see if it appears in your start menu now? I'm not
sure whether it will launch or not but it should be in the list!

Thanks,

Kyle

*Ian Parnaby, 12 Oct 2023, 08:28 BST:*

Morning Laurence,
These are the only options I see. It might be worth checking Emma's set up
to compare, but I'm sure there is another element that I need. I think it's
called accounting, but I could be wrong.
Not sure why it's not working with those instructions as I think you put it
on the last PC I had. Perhaps it's a Vital question next?
Thanks
Ian

Hi Ian, I followed the instructions at;

I had another look and re-ran everything and I cant see anything was missed
If it's still not working, is there someone we can ask if the above
instructions cover everything, or is there anything else?

,T20231012.0018,URGENT SUPPORT IN C14 before Tutor please,"Hi Andrew

Please can you look at the PC in C14. Ms Sharp, the supply told me that the
smartboard didn't have a connection to the computer yesterday. There have
been ongoing issues with sound as well in this room.

Unfortunately most people do not have your IT expertise, so please could
you provide Luke and I with some ""trouble-shooting"" information, so that it
can be added to the cover drive and the physical packs. It is quite
stressful for any Teacher to not have the PC/Smartboard working, nevermind
Supply staff who are new with the students and set up.

Your help is much appreciated.

Kind Regards

,T20231011.0287,Storage on i-pad,"Good afternoon.

Please could you help with my staff i-pad. There is not enough storage for
photographs and videos. You have looked at it before and said this was due
to too many Apps. I am regularly deleting photos but am unable to take a
video that lasts longer than a minute.

I really do need to be able to use it. I have a greenscreen app that I am
planning to use in a weeks time. This will involve the i-pad needing to
save a video approx 2-3 minutes long for each child.

I am very concerned that this will not work. Can you offer advice and/or
look at the i-pad again please.

The account will last for one year and then needs resetting the next year-
it makes the software free to use.

Manor Academy (Cc) in are already underway in this process, Ben the
technician is your contact. They are about two weeks ahead and so should
understand all the teething problems.

We will be using this software with Y11 and Y10 to begin and then
eventually the lower years. The rooms it will be used in are G1 and G2,
however as it is web based software this should not really matter. I do
know that you are replacing all PCs over half term, from the conversation
with Giles.

Dave Allen Head of DT is also copied into this email, as I have been
undertaking some training with him and he is very experienced with this
software.

I need Y11 Engineering to use this by half term, they have two assignments
to complete with this software.

Can you please set up as follows:-

1) IT Technician Vale of York as main administrator
2) Me as an administrator, so that I can set up students/classes

Unfortunately this has not resolved the issue and we are continuing to

   this then press 'Ok' in the window that appears in the centre of the screen
   (if you miss this the sign in screen will reload and you will need to

You can remote in any time after 9.30am. Thank you for looking at this.

Also, would you be able to advise how I can disable individual accounts for
staff that have left. When I put the surname in I get more than one person
with the same surname and can't figure out how to disable just the one
account.

Many thanks.

,T20231011.0207,Sustainability PDP - Enquiry,"Good Afternoon,

I am running the sustainability PDP option this year for 6th form. Martyn Johnson our new head of 6th form has mentioned a great campaign for a search engine that contributes towards planting trees and reforesting the planet. I have included a link below:

Ecosia on Campus<https://explore.ecosia.org/ecosia-on-campus>

Would this be something we could look at doing in school? Could we have a brief meeting to discuss?

Thanks

There are two ways to connect, using either Ebor_Academy or EAT-PSK_SBB.

,T20231011.0065,A/C unit in server room,"Hi Kat/Vital,

We have had a quote to replace the A/C unit that caused the flood in the
server room last week: £2378+VAT.

Please can either Kat or someone from Vital advise on whether a server of
our size definitely needs A/C. James has worked in several primary schools
prior to LDs, and says that none of them had air-conditioning for their
servers. We also note that the small server in the PE store
functions without one.

Any advice gratefully received!

Best wishes,
Eleanor

Could someone remote in and check settings on Teams? It automatically
starts up as it has since I first used Teams, but it's now a window that's
so large I can't see the cross icon on the top right of the screen, so I
have to run the task manager every time I boot up to close Teams down. It's
not the end of the world, but it is annoying!

When he was inputting his email I noticed he was 16rileyw@ebor.academy. I
think that on set up he has been allocated to the incorrect year group and
has since been disabled as the system would think he is a leaver.

Could you please arrange for Rileys account to be reactivated or a new one

,T20231011.0011,Alderman Cogan Projectors,"Good morning,

Do we have any update on when we will have a resolution on our 2 projectors
that are still not working in the classrooms.

Phil came and replaced one in 5T that he later realised had no bulb in. He
told us that he will be ordering us a bulb and will be back to fit it.
After returning a few days later for the model number of the projector, we
have still waited a further week and are yet to have a working board in the
classroom.

At the same time as installing the projector in 5T, Phil also brought a
projector in to replace one on 1GG. The projector did not fit onto the arm
that the projector was mounted to and then took the projector away to
replace with one that would fit. Again, we are still to have a projector in
that classroom.

The teachers are finding it increasingly difficult to teach without a
board. A lot of the schools planning and learning is based on technology
and interaction via the boards so they are finding this quite frustrating..

An update for me to pass to the teachers would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Holly

I have connected to the TPC with support from Vital this morning along with ESS so they're able to look into this issue.

SIMS will not login on the TPC which is the issue so ESS have taken some information and files so they're able to investigate what is causing this.

As soon as we receive an update from them. I will let you know.

Hi Holly

We have checked SIMS on the Server, it appears the services may have stopped so a reboot was performed to restart them.

Please can you check if the sync between SIMS and Edulink is now running as it should?

Many Thanks,

Hi,

We don't seem have to a connection with SIMS and Edulink.

Please could you look into this?

Thanks

Do you mean you need to record your main school greeting message (Press 1 for this, 2 for that etc) or is it recording a voicemail greeting where the caller can leave a message?

Thank you for fixing the lead to the projector in room 311 - it is working
well now.

The only problem is that it has now affected the sound - there is virtually
no volume, it is that low. Please would you mind looking at it?

Thanks,

*Year-end statement: urgent action required*

*Why we’re contacting you*

We did not receive your school’s year-end statement for the National
Tutoring Programme (NTP) by the deadline last week.


We are aware that some users had difficulties accessing the form and we
thank you for your patience.


We have now fixed the issue and reopened the form to give you a final
opportunity to submit.



You must submit the year-end statement
<https://news.service.education.gov.uk/10A62B4FA25F9B74CDC17420D8414C867AFFFE4EBC625C25445C70474DE43D4E/7D264052E307D54846A037BDA1E04A19/LE35>
as soon as possible, and by no later than *2pm on Thursday** 12 October.*

This is a hard deadline and failure to submit your form will result in your
full funding allocation being recovered by the ESFA. You must complete the
form even if you did not use any of your NTP funding.


If your school converted to an academy after 1 August 2023, you’ll need to
select your old establishment and URN when completing the form, rather than
your new one.

*If you need help*

We’ve published guidance on how to submit your year-end statement
<https://news.service.education.gov.uk/73BDA706D033977F0072CC449E2C63383E697AE6AB36CB086D1D17A72C56F4D4/7D264052E307D54846A037BDA1E04A19/LE35>,

Hi Holly

I have connected to the TPC with support from Vital this morning along with ESS so they're able to look into this issue.

SIMS will not login on the TPC which is the issue so ESS have taken some information and files so they're able to investigate what is causing this.

As soon as we receive an update from them. I will let you know.

Many Thanks,

Subject: Compass Academy EduLink One reporting SIMS Critical Error
To: H Lockyer <h.lockyer@com.hslt.academy>

Hi Heather,

We have noticed on our monitoring that our EduLink agent is reporting a SIMS Critical error.

Could you ask your IT Team to check the settings in the Edulink Agent> MIS Connection are still valid.

Please forward any errors to us.

Regards,

David.

Hi Holly

We have checked SIMS on the Server, it appears the services may have stopped so a reboot was performed to restart them.

Please can you check if the sync between SIMS and Edulink is now running as it should?

Many Thanks,

Hi,

We don't seem have to a connection with SIMS and Edulink.

Please could you look into this?

Thanks

,T20231010.0113,Re: Computer issues,"Hello Karen,

Just to go over your requests

1) M1, is a projector issue I believe, I did mention to Georgie on Friday
that I wasn't here until today to take a look at but will see if I can take
a look today

M7, we were waiting for the license for smart this has arrived but I only
got the email from Laura yesterday while I was at Pindar, I have now sorted
this so she should be able to log in

G5 - As far as I am aware the issue with this will be the board positioning
in relation to the computer I can take a look at this, but it really is an
IT Support Issue

Just a side note on this. When we put the screens in departments they were
asked to prioritise the rooms that would have screens which is what I
believe Georgie did for the 5 that we provided for her department, we are
pushing for more with the trust but these budgets have to be authorised at
that level and are out of our control. Emma is pushing for this ASAP

2) I believe Emma has contacted Simon about this as we were looking to
replace them with a set of Chromebooks but they don't seem to have arrived

3) Chromebooks should be able to access the remote desktop at which point
they should be able to create and manage resources through this system, Lee
can you please chase up when our RDS server is coming back online onsite.
As a side to this, can you please let me know which staff need this access
as the majority of teaching staff do not use interactive software, so is
this just the maths department?

4) The Sparx DPIA although completed hasn't been fully approved buy the
trust, I have only approved the same access that Hegarty had as it is the
same company. I made this clear to Georgie at the time, and stated that the
DPIA would need to be approved so that I could include include parent
information.

We keep going back to the fact other schools are using these facilities,
but the fact of the matter is that other schools should not be using this
facility until it is approved by the DPO. Something I have mentioned a few
times also.

Although this wont resolve all of the issues I hope it explains why we are
where we are with this

so yesterday afternoon I tried the Chromebooks again. 10 of the 30 wouldn't
log on in the classroom. However, if they popped into the pod next door
they did and then they could be brought into the classroom and they worked.

Any ideas?

As part of my meeting today with the DOLs multiple issues were raised
regarding IT access. In summary;

1) Boards in M1, M7 and G5 cannot be used effectively. IT support have
looked and said they cannot be fixed. What can I give as feedback to the
teachers struggling to deliver curriculum due to these issues?
2) MCR is without any access to computers, when will this be usable again?
Students are needing to access the facilities in here but currently cannot
3) Some staff dont have access to laptops. They are aware they can use
chromebooks but the interactive whiteboards software is not compatible with
the chromebooks so planning cannot be done outside of school. This is
significantly hindering staff and causing workload issues for many
4) Sparx (used in Maths) has the facility to email parents with concerns,
we know this is the cse as other schools in the Trust use this facility,
but we cannot use the facility here. Can anyone support with making this
possible?

Morning Jonathan,

You're not the only person to report an issue with the remote desktop. However, I'm still waiting for some information on that issue. Could you confirm if that was a personal device and if it worked when you tried to use the full client (downloading the rdp file and opening it) I'm just wondering if it's the same issue.

Thanks,

Kyle

Hi Jonathan I'll mark this as resolved but if there are any issues let us know and we'll ask Vital to take a further look into it.

Kyle Meehan, 9 Oct 2023, 08:18 BST

Morning Jonathan,

You're not the only person to report an issue with the remote desktop. However, I'm still waiting for some information on that issue. Could you confirm if that was a personal device and if it worked when you tried to use the full client (downloading the rdp file and opening it) I'm just wondering if it's the same issue.

Thanks,

Kyle

Hi

Is there an issue again with remote access?

Marcus had said he'd get in touch last wednesday about my last ticket
please but i'm guessing he got busy elsewhere...

I still cannot access google drive on my phone
I still cannot access google drive via my documents at school and some
pathways are not showing for staff
I am still getting a bounce back when Angeal emails me

and a new one...

I have just bought a camera for my desktop to conduct virtual meetings
easier than my laptop but with it being a usb, it won't allow access...  is
there any way around this at all, like the CPOMs keys please???

I was using a year 7 brand new email account to demonstrate using email yesterday and when searching for my name using s.mca it also suggested this email to the students. Do we know why the students are being provided with external email addresses for unknown adults, when they start to type. It's a risk from a safeguarding perspective but also GDPR if staff are being suggested email addresses for people they don't even know?
Can we stop it?

It has come to my attention that I am not on the all.y13teachers mailing list and neither is Debbie Tranter. Stephen Foreman (who doesn't teach Y13!) received an email today about early entry students that had not come to me so we checked the recipient list and I am not on there. This occurred last year in Y12 and we were not aware of it until emails were mentioned that had not been received.

Just wanted you to be aware and hopefully it can be sorted by Vital asap.

Thanks,

,T20231009.0163,Laptop repair update,"Good afternoon

We recently raised a ticket for Tim & Michaela's laptops to be repaired.
Michaela's was done and returned by the technician the next day, but we
haven't had an update on Tim's, which was the webcam / screen issue.

Is there an update please on how much longer it will be with you?

Tim is currently using another person's and this really isn't ideal, and is
only possible as we are waiting for a new member of staff to join us.  Once
they start, they will need the laptop which Tim is currently using.  Should
we not be provided with a temporary replacement as part of the managed
service?

Kind regards

Hi Lynn and Sam,

I’m not sure if it’s to do with the original damage

[cid:18b13541782e4e019f71]
Is there any possibility of a replacement screen.

I think our bulb has just blown? Could be something else but there was a
big pop, it whirred very loudly for a minute and smells slightly of
burning. Tried turning it back on but no luck, just whirring again.

,T20231009.0051,Fully funded courses.,"From ""Nick Porter"" <info@wefindanylearner.co.uk>: Hello,

We are absolutely thrilled to announce that we are offering not one, not two, but THREE of our most popular online courses completely free of charge! Yes, you heard that right - FREE!

But don't wait too long to register your interest, as spots are filling up fast. This is an incredible opportunity that you won't want to miss out on. You can easily sign up on our website at www.wefindanylearner.com/book-online/ or by contacting our team at 01226 958 888.

All you need to do is meet a few simple criteria, including being at least 19 years old by August 31st, 2022, residing in England, and not currently enrolled in an apprenticeship program.

Enrol today and let's make a difference together!

Counselling Skills Level 2
Many people find it helpful to seek counselling at some point in their lives, and a counsellor can provide support for people in all sorts of situations. If you’re interested in supporting people to improve their personal well-being, this course will provide you with the correct understanding, knowledge and skills to do that. You’ll learn about core counselling skills and how to use them in a counselling relationship. You will also be taught about counselling theory and the ethical framework that informs how counsellors use their skills.

Mental Health First Aid Level 2
It’s important that employers are transparent and open about mental health issues, and this qualification builds an understanding of mental health problems and the support available to colleagues. Increasing the understanding of the mental health of staff at all levels builds a culture of care and support.

Understanding Autism Level 2
This course will give you an understanding of autism and the principles of supporting individuals with autism. You will look at the person-centred approach and the influence that positive communication methods can have and will gain an understanding of how individuals with autism can be supported to live healthy and fulfilled lives.

I hope that you had a good weekend.
Sorry to demand so much of your time, but the desktop monitor in S12 is
doing that slight duplication-not that clear thing where the text isn't
quite in focus. I have checked the connections and they all seem secure (to
me at least) so is there something else I should do please?
Thank you,
Clare

Morning Jonathan,

You're not the only person to report an issue with the remote desktop. However, I'm still waiting for some information on that issue. Could you confirm if that was a personal device and if it worked when you tried to use the full client (downloading the rdp file and opening it) I'm just wondering if it's the same issue.

Thanks,

Kyle

Hi Lisa
I’ve tried to login to my school email address but it won’t let me? I have
my own gmail address but I tried on an incognito tab as I’ve had to do that
before with work emails.
This is the message I received

I wanted to be able to email all the class teachers today so I’ll try to do
it from my personal email address….although not sure of it will work.
Cheers
Helen

I am getting constant messages when I am signing in through the smccat log
in. It's saying I need to enter a microsoft password. I already have the
authenticator app for the nicholas postgate. It is really confusing, but it
says it will stop me from logging in on the 11th October. Can someone
please help?

Many thanks,
Clare

I am just wondering if you would be able to install a previous version of
Smart Notebook on my laptop as I have made Smart Notebooks at home and many
of the features I need to teach from it don't work on the 23 version e.g.
dual screen and the paper backgrounds disappear.

I have tried opening my smarts in Smart Notebook 22 but the option of dual
screen is greyed out and it won't let me access it through the 'View' bar
to turn it on either.

To: L Welsh <l.welsh@gps.hslt.academy>


Hi Lesley,

I have had 3 parental requests to borrow a chromebook for their Year 8
child as they don't have access to one at home.
The three students are:

Kyle Williams
Tayla- Rai Baron
Alina Nicolai

I just wanted to check if this would be possible?

Thanks,

Emma

Subject: Seneca MIS integration
To:


Good afternoon,

Thank you for your inquiry about integrating your MIS with Seneca.

We have had a previous request from your school and have already got Wonde
access granted. The problem is that not all of your student and teacher
emails seem to be on your school's MIS.
Are you able to speak to your IT/Data manager to get this updated?

Also, I am very happy to liaise directly with them if you let me have their
contact details.

I look forward to being able to get your school integrated with Seneca very
soon.

Best wishes,

Hi Donna

Further to our meeting with respect to your existing CCTV recorders I can confirm the following:-

Your existing recorders are of an age now.
When originally installed these units were obviously current models.
In addition to the age of the units, CCTV technology has moved forward. Any new cameras that we install are double the image quality. New cameras are 4 megapixel, the original cameras are only 2 megapixel.
This means that the existing recorders are working very hard due to the increase in data and additional cameras installed.
New recorders have a greater throughput and more processing power.
I advise that your two units are upgraded, which means replacement.
Please find attached my quotation to replace your two recorders.
Please also be aware that we will utilise the existing hard disk drives from your existing machines saving a lot of money.
However this would result in the drives being formatted (wiped of recording data)

Regards

I'm now down to 12 computers out of 27 as the others (15) are failing to
let students to log in. Every change of class I have another one or two
students cannot access.
The library has at least 2 more weeks of testing (CATS, GL's, Reading Plus
& STAR).

It's proved difficult this week with testing using the computers and
chromebooks, as students find half way through a test the internet has
suddenly disabled their account and reset the test.

I know there are conversations about replacing and removing these
computers. I'm stuck as I need them... yet cannot use them.

If anyone can give me an idea when they might be fixed or replaced. It
would be helpful.

,T20231006.0112,Access to ChatGTP,"Hi,

Is it at all possible to open up staff access to ChatGTP? It is a fantastic
tool to reduce teacher workload and it would come in really handy at the
minute when we are trying to make feedback questions based on student
performance in exams. If possible I would like to use some of my department
meeting time on Wednesday to go through the various different uses of
ChatGTP. Thank you.

*SIMS server needs restarting*

Hi Hannah

It looks like your *SIMS* connection with Wonde isn’t working as expected.
This will affect the syncing and updating of any information between *Newland

Wonde.

*Please be assured, even though the connection is failing, your data is
protected and secure.*


*Next steps*

Access the machine and open SIMS.net

If you get a SIMS error message when attempting to log in then the recent
client update has not been successful and you will need to reboot the
server.

If you are able to open SIMS.net please re-apply the latest SIMS client
update to the server and reboot again.

*Once the above steps are complete*, please email
<support@wonde.com>*support@wonde.com

and an identifier such as the DfE number or URN.

Usually it is spam/junk and the one you’ve got looks like it so click block and I will stop anymore. Be careful though as sometimes it doesn’t like genuine contacts and blocks them – I had two yesterday I had to release.

That’s right isn’t it James??

Hi James,

I tried to do a webinar at home last night and the laptop logged in normally (blue screen) but then went black, no start menu just black. Control Alt delete still worked and it went to normal blue menu?

I've left it in Art office on desk.

Last year for parents evenings, we conducted GForm surveys on
chromebooks/iPads.

For the first parents' evening of the year on Tuesday, please can you
arrange for 5-6 chromebooks/iPads to be downstairs in the Agora for me to
ask parents to complete surveys on.

I have the survey as a GForm so I can share it with you and you just get it
ready on the devices.

Hi Stuart

I'm unable to access documents on shared drive as they haven't synced.
This is important as I need to formally offer someone a place and can't access the necessary documents.
I've spoken to Marcus at Vital who seems baffled and has gone away to speak to James.
Hope I hear back!

Hi Sophie,

Could you arrange for the ""Lichess"" website - https://lichess.org/. To be
unblocked. It is a chess site that I use for teaching. Sometimes schools
firewalls block it. I couldn't access it yesterday.

Thanks in advance,

This has been going on for months (since the Summer term), sometimes
working fine, sometimes not working at all with no warning, meaning I have
to adapt my teaching and resources last minute. Today it won't connect and
is now not turning on at all; my PC is showing a pale blue screen and is

Would it be possible for someone to come and have another go at making a
secure and reliable connection?

,T20231005.0104,For immediate action,"Hi Craig,

This is Vicky Moore’s CPOMS log in the incident we discussed earlier.
Please action:

In Computing yesterday, Nathan's log on screen was left with the Nirvana
logo on it, which he has set on his background.

Another student (Edward Alsop) reported after the end of the lesson to me
that Nathan had installed a browser to allow them to do this.

I reported this to IT and last night myself and Craig (IT) checked Nathan's
log in Impero.

Nathan had been using a web browser called Opera GX in his lessons which he
appears to have downloaded.

We were unsure how he had managed to do this (e.g. did he bring it in on a
memory stick) and so brought Nathan to the technicians room P1 today to
speak with him.

Nathan said he downloads the browser from a website in as he finds it
easier to use than Google, when we queried what in particular he was
unclear (lots of little things) and so we have asked him to write these
down if he remembers them so we can see if they can be installed on Google
which is fully monitored by Smooth wall. Nathan explained he had simply
been using the browser for class work, as he finds it easier. It also has
some games which are blocked on Google which he can access from this
browser (he knows he should not be on games too as I have spoken to him in
class about this before).

We have explained to Nathan how the monitoring works and shown him how this
logs everything, we have also explained why we were concerned as
potentially Opera is not monitored in quite the same way and so things
could be accessed which were not suitable in theory - he has been asked not
to use/install this any more in lessons. Craig also briefly explained some
online security to Nathan, such as being careful what you install and where
from as potentially could damage PCs/Network which is in breach of network
policy and also could be illegal.

With regards to his desktop, he said he was simply able to change this and
there were no restrictions - he was not sure how exactly but he said it was
something he did ages ago.

Logging for information - Nathan has been told he is not in trouble this
time as he does not appear to have done anything malicious from what he has
explained (apart from trying to access games occasionally which I always
ask him to turn off anyway).

He is interested in games design and wants to pursue this as a career in
the future.

I was unable to tag Craig Pritchard in perhaps as he works for Vital not
ASA?

The student’s name is Nathan Patterson.

Thanks
Lee

Good morning Lucy,

The interactive whiteboard in Seedlings is not working. It was fine
yesterday morning and just stopped working through the day. It is possible
that a wire has been disconnected by a pupil but we cannot figure out which
one. Sewells had a look at it yesterday afternoon but were unable to help.
The sound will play but the screen is blank.
Can you help us with this please?

Thank you

Wendy

Zulma Herrera has been added to the all.modernlanguages email distribution list, which isn't really sensible as she only pops in to support sixth-formers with speaking skills rather than having a full teaching role. Could you remove her from the list please?

Thanks very much,
Sarah

,T20231005.0041,Re: Server Replacement at All Saints,"Hi Pete

All Saints' are the only schools in the trust not 100% supported by Vital -
much of the work is done by East Riding IT.

That said, Vital - please let us know your thoughts, by email initially and
then perhaps with a Google Meet?

Hello, this is Reece snowballs mum, Reece has lost his I pad at school on
Tuesday, he had spent all day today trying to find it,  he’s had no luck
and it hasn’t been handed in. I would like to know how to solve this issue
as Reece is getting himself all worked up and very upset that he will be
issued codes due to not having his I pad and not being able to complete
homework tasks. Reece always tries his best at school and wants to achieve
merits, he never gets codes and the thought of it causing him distress.

Thank you, Samantha snowball

Error messages often come up when I try to open documents and I cannot

Could it be that an update is needed?

My board is no longer interactive ( again) with my laptop This was fixed a
few weeks ago but stopped working after two days. I put in a new HDMI cable
and that solved the problem for a few days but now the problem has
reoccured.

I know the problem is with my laptop as another colleague hooked her device
up and it was interactive.

Please could you remedy this as soon as possible as it is making lesson

Sorry to bother you once again, but my visualiser is not working.  It connects ok but I only get still images rather than a video.  I have looked at the settings and checked that they are set for video and not photo but it still doesn't budge.  I have tried a different visualiser, and it does the same so the problem is what the computer rather than the visualiser.

,T20231004.0194,Canon Printer Photocopier - Wigginton School,"Hi Joe,

I spoke with Adam Smith a while ago about helping us with the Wigginton School Canon photocopier as it's not linked to staff ID cards and doesn't allow for individual codes for printing, so if staff send anything to the printer it can be printed off by anyone.

I've had many discussions with Canon during which they've tried to sell me expensive additional software. Finally they've told me of something called Uniflow Online Express Cloud which supports a PIN code for device access. Apparently, this is customer installable. When I asked for more information on how to install it, they sent me a link and told me to direct my IT provider to it.

Is this something you can help us with please?

Can some please have a look at this.
If a device from another school is on ASA site they auto connect as expected.

,T20231004.0065,Unable to print from certain computers in school.,"Hi

I'm unable to print from the 2 'PPA Area' computers in school. I can
apparently send a job but then it doesn't appear on the printer. I know
other staff in school are having similar problems with these and other
computers in school. I am able to print from other computers but I need one
of these for PPA, as well as all classroom computers as I cover across the
school.

One of my student's log-ins has stopped working. I've tried on multiple
laptops and it says his user isnt found.
His username is : 16charliejw@com.hslt.academy.

Additionally, i emailed earlier in the term reference getting an additional
stand-alone desk top computer moved from the storage in the server room
into my classroom in N2. I have spoken to the gentleman who works with the
academy and he mentioned that I would have to place an official ticket in
in order for him to move it across.

Hi Oliver,

It's an issue getting the photo's uploaded from the ipads onto the google
drive. I've encountered the same problem in other classes too, so
there must be other people needing this fixing.

For the work I am doing for school at the moment, I need a third computer
monitor. I have one set up on my desk and it is connected to my hard drive,
but the computer is unable to see the 3rd screen.

Is there anything you can do to make the drive see and work with my 3rd
monitor?

Kind regards

I've received this email from Adobe but haven't received a quote. Have you
received anything? I believe Dan arranged for the licences on our behalf?
We don't want to lose them after the palaver in getting them to work.

Would someone be able to look into this for us?

Many thanks :-)

A new email address was created for our trainee teacher - Libby Bryant.
There is a spelling mistake in her email - l.byrant@bgp.hslt.academy.
 Please could this be changed to l.bryant@bgp.hslt.academy?

The chromebook logins we have for our Year 1 students, many of them have a
d after their first name instead of their last initial, one is
spelt incorrectly and can we please change one to a known name instead of a
given name?  I've put the changes in the attached excel sheet.

,T20231004.0017,Monitor Connection Cable,"Good morning,

Strange request - I was wondering if we had any cables like the one
pictured below to connect a desktop PC to a monitor...

[image: image.png]

If so, would I be able to borrow it? I have got a new, cheap PC to use at
home and the HDMI cable won't work (long story that I won't bore you with)
so I want to try and see if a different connector will work.

Many thanks,

,T20231003.0255,screen and projector in the gym - Monday 16th Oct,"Hi Andrew,

Would it be possible to set up a projector and screen in the gym ready for
12.30pm start on Monday 16th October?

We have an event called ""restart a heart"" all day and will use the assembly
hall  for all the other sessions but the assembly hall is needed for
lunchtime so we will move to the gym lesson 4 - is that possible?? (I have
checked that we can use the gym with AWO).

Thanks

Jackie has asked me to get in touch with you to ask if it would be possible
for Giles to spare some time tomorrow afternoon to help get EdVal working
on Jackie's computer in her office.
The Trust have added this for her, but she is unable to open it. IT Support
at the Trust have tried to fix the problem, but have been unsuccessful.
They think the problem must be at the school end somehow blocking access to
it.
If tomorrow afternoon is not possible please could you let me know when you
might be able to come and have a look at it?

,T20231003.0229,Badge Request Form not working,"Good afternoon,

A number of staff members have reported that the Badge Request Form is not
working / they are unable to submit any badges.

Unfortunately, I do not know where this file is located / I'm not the owner
of the Badge Request Form, so there isn't much I can do to try and resolve
the issue.

Please could you have a look at it when you get a free moment.

Many thanks in advance.

Best wishes,

,T20231003.0223,WO2,"Hi,

I'm struggling still with the computer in WO2. The PPs are saving automatically and not providing an option to undo. The screen does not look like a typical screen elsewhere in the school. I've tried to adjust to 'extend' but the computer freezes when I do this.

It is making working from the classroom almost impossible.

I'm sure there is an easy fix - I just can't find it!

Please look at this when I am in the room so I can explain the issue.

Many thanks

Clare

We have approx 4 laptops that are used for supply staff to cover classes.
Unfortunately none of these are allowing staff to sign in to use the
laptops.  Could you please advise what we need to do? or if someone could
visit Hempland to take a look at them.

We have tried supply log in and also members of staff cannot get on either
so it isn't just external users.

Many thanks

A member of staff created a Shared Drive folder 'CWR Maths'. They
accidently removed themselves as a 'Manager', and are now a 'Content
Manager'. There is no 'Manager' for the group anymore, so no one can add
members to the group or move folders within the shared drive folder.

Please can you change 'acraske@cwr.pmat.academy' from 'Content manager', to
'Manager'.

Kind regards,

Johnathan.

We have some spare equipment that is no longer required at Hempland
following the recent installation in the Summer.

If you could ask someone to come over and collect it that would be great.
We also have two hard drives which I don't think are required now too.

On another note, some staff are struggling to find our pathfinder portal
when they log on.  If you could advise how this can be installed that would
be greatly appreciated.  I have tried to get them to sign in and out so
that they would be asked to sync their data.  This is not an option.

If you could advise what is the alternative or what we aren't doing, that
would be good.

Many thanks,

We have been trying to reset Robyn’s password on her school account, but unfortunately it will not allow us to do so.
Robyn has been unable to complete her textiles homework because of this, however, she has managed to do a few traces of a few things she would like to add to her mood board.

Please would it be possible to get Robyn’s password reset as I’m unsure how to help her with this.

Hi Rachel,

Didn't know who to ask about this- Sarah Gordon has just informed me that
Esme Rennie-Oxley's picture on arbor is incorrect- and she's right- it's
Sophia Newton...
Sorry, but hoped you might know who is sorting the photos out!

Thanks

Katie

Subject: Update on Mehar Bano Username and Password
To: Rob Deamer <rdeamer@ahs.pmat.academy>


Dear Mr. Deamer,

As we have filled my daughter Mehar Bano's [Year 9] Registration forms on
21 September,2023 in our visit to Archbishop Holgate's school, however,
after 13 days we haven't received any of User names and Passwords of
following:

1: Sparx
2: Parents Pay
3: Class Charts

That is why,my daughter is not able to do her homework on time and also,
she is reluctant to buy food during her break. Can you please look into
this matter asap as Maher's math homework deadline is on 5 October.

Regards

Salman Zafar

Hi both,

Is there a quick way to fill this form in? It's to access an external
training programme we use for Year 12 and Year 13 scientists.

I need to be able to pull all the email addresses for students who study
biology, chemistry and/or physics into one spreadsheet.

Thanks,

Mike

The interactive board in the wraparound room doesn't work.
I've taken a look and it's missing a cable, however, because there is a
telephone in the room there is no available port to put an additional cable
in.

Is there a work-around this?

Thanks

,T20231002.0314,iPad update,"Good evening,

I’m just emailing to enquire about my iPad. It’s been sent for a screen
replacement and I am attending the Google ‘Future of Education’ conference
in Madrid as of next Monday and I’m hoping that I would be able to take my
iPad for this.

I’d also like to request to see if there would be a way that I can download
applications without having to send a request as I’m aware that whilst
participating in the conference, new applications and AI resources will be
available to instantly download.

I hope you could accommodate my request and have my iPad returned by Friday
6th October at Alderman Cogan.

I’m aware that you will be busy but it would be very much appreciated and
I’d be very grateful if you could accommodate my polite request.

My iPad number is: ACSDFE10
Nathan Hill
Alderman Cogan School

I hope to hear from you soon,

Kind regards,

Nathan

Hello,

Hope you are ok?

How have things been today?

I know you have so much on your plate and that I have joked about needing a
new laptop but it is now genuinely on the verge of breaking! Last week it
would not load certain things or took an age to do it and today it has
completely frozen twice with a scrambled screen and needed a full reboot
each time. Please could you request that Vital assign a new one? They were
supposed to do this pre Summer but it never materialised.

Thank you
Sam

,T20231002.0214,Inventry Log in,"Good afternoon

Please can I chase up the ongoing issues we are having with
Inventry.  There is still an upload issue that Donna has reported , we
cannot sign children in on the screen as the upload has not been done
putting them in their correct classes,. I think there is some sort of issue
with this.

The Inventry Evacuation shortcut is only currently on Donna's computer and
if the fire alarm was to go off no other staff in the office can access
this and as Donna is not here today this is very concerning. We have spoken
to Johnny who assures us that this is been looked into, if someone can get
back to us that would be great.

Many thanks

Thanks for the extension lead, I have moved the iPad cabinet. I also realised that it's much more space efficient to move the computer and printer over to the right on the other worktop too. (about 50cm) I've shifted them over but it means that the computer and monitor is plugged into the extension lead, is that OK??

Is there a chance you can reinstated r.marshall@poppletonroadprimary.co.uk ?

I've just had a very difficult PSHE lesson due to the ongoing issues with the projector, remote and speakers. This has been ongoing for some time in this room and prevented me freezing and muting the screen as required and hearing the audio on the attached videos.

It is also very difficult to conduct form time activities when multiple screen views are required. Is there a timescale on this being fixed?

Subject: Patch & Fileset for census

Good morning Giles,


There is a patch and fileset needed for the upcoming school census on 6th October, we don’t have a record of them being applied to Aspire Academy yet.



They have both been authorised in Solus so would you be happy to deploy them or would you like to give me a connection to schedule them in for you?



The patch is 28383 – consolidated database patch 2 for summer release statutory returns and the fileset is 2504 if you wanted to schedule them yourself, but can you let me know either way.



Regards,

Fiona

In my first week here, a few staff members mentioned that as staff we
should be given chromebooks/laptops, but I've not been given one.
Is this something that was an older procedure that isn't standard practice
any more or is there somewhere I need to go to collect this?

Thanks for the replacement computer, everything appears to be working fine
apart from the fact that Schools Broadband is blocking access to Box.com
which I use regularly and have done for a couple of years now.  I can use
it on other computers which is odd so assume something with this actual
computer rather than my account.

I can use another computer when needed today but it will be a problem from
tomorrow.

Sorry I have 3 issues that I need help with:

1.  I have realised that I do not have access to Google Drive from this
part of my computer! (as the picture shows below).  This is therefore
stopping me from seeing some important files.

2.  I still cannot get onto my emails or Google drive on my phone.

3.  I am still having weird things happen when I email Angela Oswald back.
I am unable to reply to any emails without deleting the addressee as it
sends it back to me.  I have to remember to delete and retype in
aoswald@pmat.academy, even though she sends me the emails from that address!

,T20231002.0105,PC Login Across PMAT Sites,"Good morning,

Would a member of PMAT staff from one school be able to log in on another
PMAT school site if they are not a central services member of staff?

For example, would a HPA staff member be able use their existing school
account to log on to a PC at Archbishop Holgate's?

Many thanks,
Mia

I’m just following up on this one as I haven’t received a response to the query raised last week.

Please could we arrange a remote session to the Papercut server and investigate the issue with the AD information not updating for the end users?

Hi Support,

We have a ticket raised regarding the recent changes to email address and this affecting Papercut print and scanning software.

Lucy advised that the old email addresses were still being used for scan to email and printer login. After checking Papercut it appears that the email addresses have not updated from the old addresses to the new. This should happen dynamically as the Papercut software syncs with the sync source daily.

Please could someone give me a call on my direct number below so we can further troubleshoot the issue. We will need to arrange access to the server running the Papercut software to investigate further.

Kind Regards,

Simon

Dear Mr S Rescorle ,

Hope this finds you well.

Reena informed me that she doesn't get ipad while distributed to others.

As we are living in York temporarily, I didn't signed up for it. Can you
kindly arrange one for her to use?

Thanks

You are on my separate all staff contact list but the all.staff one is generated by Vital and I have no control over that one. I've copied in Stuart so he can sort.

,T20231002.0032,Re: Twitter/X app on Ipads,"Holly,

There are still issues with the Twitter app on a number of staff iPads, I
have noted that some of the iPads have the new black 'X' app logo (and
these are all working fine) whilst others still have the the old blue
'Twitter' app logo (and these are not working fine).

This is incredibly frustrating for the staff, how can I resolve this?

unable to access my daughter's account. The reset process has been somewhat
confusing. Sienna can access Sparksmaths, but TT Rockstars won't allow

Also when inputting https:www.gra.hslt.academy won't allow access from a

Hi Lesley,

Genuine question. Obviously I already got a Chromebook which is great in
work for meeting as I can carry it around in meetings do notes live and so
on - I’m just wondering if I’m allowed a lap top for home? It’s using word
and spreadsheets when working at home - downloading and sending to external
agencies is what I’m finding the hardest.

Is there any capacity for this?

Just wanted to outline the IT requirements for next week:

Monday P4 - L14
Tuesday P5 - J21
Friday P1 - L14

Please could you ensure that the updated Tracker software is on the relevant computers for these periods?

If there's no chance L14 can be sorted for Monday P4, let me know and I'll do something else.


Thanks so much for your continued support with this.

Yes - an automated system would be great if possible please James? So when you send over the log-ins and passwords the print codes could come over too?

,T20230929.0157,Input into a year 12 Hardware Trouble Shooting lesson - 05/10/23 - p4,"Hi
Spoke to Giles about this today. I am teaching out year 12 class about the process of hardware trouble shooting, and it talks a lot about getting a ticket and working through what the thought process is from receiving the ticket, diagnosing the error to a fix. I wondered if you were free to spend 10 mins talking to them about what you do when you get tickets and your most common errors and fixes. There are only 5 of them so they are a really nice group.

Thanks

As discussed with Lee yesterday, again today my projector is 'flickering'
which is not ideal and could cause issues with students that have
epilepsy / migraines .

Moreover, the clarity of my board, is poor especially when the sun shines.
Lee told me there was nothing he could do and suggested blinds

Please could these two issues be looked at?

Just wanted to put in writing the current issues/queries already raised:

My computer - which can't decide whether it's working or not - varies
wildly throughout the day.
Screen swaps - swapping large screens on tiny desk with the smaller screens
on adjacent desk
Guest wifi - clarification needed on the procedure for delegate wifi access
going forward (we have codes just for the next few weeks).

 Hi Vanessa, 
   
 SIMS had an issue with the summer release which prevented the photo report from running on Wonde.  They've since resolved this and Wonde have advised that the patch below will resolve the issue on SIMS:  Patch Number: 28262   Patch Description: Fix to resolve the reporting crash for On Roll students after summer 2023 upgrade.  If you can let me know once that has been applied and I'll trigger the report manually and run a sync to update the account.

Hi Sam,

In the History department, we are leaving verbal comments on Year 13
Coursework using Beep on Google Chrome. Some members of the department are
struggling to access it - David Knox even says he's blocked! Any ideas what
the issue might be? Is it just a case of staff re-downloading the plugin?

Many thanks,

,T20230929.0013,Having trouble with Chromebooks in Y4 at Deramore's,"Hello Vital

The last two weeks we have had real problems with getting the class logged
on in Y4 at LDs, first lesson on Thursday both weeks - out of 30 kids we
had about 5 or 6 each week that it wouldn't log on even after several
attempts. Trying again 5 minutes later it worked for most of them, although
there was one kid that we were faffing about for about 10 minutes before
she finally got on!

We've also found that they were often having to refresh to get GClassroom
to load, and then in Purple Mash there were a few similar things - pages
needing to be refreshed to load properly etc. It isn't password mistakes -
the class teacher and I have both seen it happening, and checked the
usernames/passwords are correct! Mark said that they were getting 404
errors - not sure if that was at login, on going to classroom or when going
to purple mash or if it happened at all of those as I wasn't there when
that happened.

Today I used the same set of Chromebooks after playtime with the Y2 class,
across the corridor and all of them managed to get logged on, onto
classroom, and onto TTRS without seeming to have these issues - and last
week with the Y2s after play we did logging on, going to classroom, and
logging on to Purple Mash as in Y4 with no real issues.

I don't think the problem is user error - the Y4s are pretty competent,
apart from anything else! It doesn't seem to be affecting specific
children, or specific devices. It is really noticeable when getting all 30
logging on at the same time - it feels like a network/bandwidth problem.
I've not heard reports from any other classes - I don't know if there's
something specific about thursday mornings that means the network is
unusually contested, or if there could be a problem with an access point
that affects that classroom more than others?

It has led to a few rather challenging lessons in there - could someone
investigate please?

Thank you!

We've had a few children using their Chrome books this afternoon - as they start a search in Google the drop down list gives suggestions of what they might want to search. Included today were, 'What to do if your pee stings' and 'what to do if your boobs are lumpy'...and others. They had only typed the words, 'what to do'.

Please could you look into why these options would appear?

,T20230928.0212,Agilico Ticket #2309-6463 - Westfield Primary School,"From Simon Pearson <simon.pearson@agilico.co.uk>: Hi Support,

We have a ticket raised regarding the recent changes to email address and this affecting Papercut print and scanning software.

Lucy advised that the old email addresses were still being used for scan to email and printer login. After checking Papercut it appears that the email addresses have not updated from the old addresses to the new. This should happen dynamically as the Papercut software syncs with the sync source daily.

Please could someone give me a call on my direct number below so we can further troubleshoot the issue. We will need to arrange access to the server running the Papercut software to investigate further.

Kind Regards,

Simon

holiday.  I'm not sure what the printer is at the Lakeside setting to be
able to add myself and couldn't see anything that looked likely on the drop
down list so wonder if you could help with this?

Also, I work for the NHS and have my laptop with me when at settings to
write my notes etc.  I wonder if there was any chance I would be able to
print directly from my laptop rather than having to email documents to
myself then log on on a desktop here to print?  That might be a long shot,
but if it could be possible it would be amazing!

Thank you so much for your help,

Laura Cookson

We also now have no sound in B7 - again a real issue as all schemes of work
require audio-visual resources.

Please can both issues be resolved asap - or temporary solutions put in
place while a more permanent solution is looked at?

Hello Caroline,

The original request was for  Richard Bunce is unable to access certain websites (including Google) or readtheory.org<http://readtheory.org> and www.nationalcollege.com<http://www.nationalcollege.com>, these websites are allowed for everyone at the school and are not blocked, can you connection to them.

If Richard Bunce is still no able to connect  on all websites, can you ask him to try connection from different PC's and let us know what is the IP address of the machine he was connecting from and the time of the connection  to see the logs and see why he has been blocked. also as this is only an individual case you need to get your IT provider to get involved and see if that issue is local issue as these websites are not blocked for the hole school.

,T20230928.0070,SMART software,"Morning

Tried to sort this with the NPCAT IT desk but they told me to come to you.

For some reason I can no longer get SMART software on my laptop. Looks like
it has uninstalled itself. Probably in the numerous email changes we've had
recently...

It's asking me for a cod/password when I try and install.

Any ideas?

Cheers

Hi Michelle

Is Jack able to come and connect the static computers to the whiteboards in
the cabins?  I'm not sure if there is internet to them that isn't wireless?

Also, are you going to the risk management training tomorrow morning with
the trust?

Thanks Helen

We are having problems with two PCs in the Hub - the one near the printer and the one in the corner on the wall near the door. My colleagues were unable to save work on them and they also couldn't send anything to print. If you were able to take a look when you got chance, that would be great.

Many thanks

,T20230927.0184,Fwd: Contact form Submission from Class Charts (MIS Integrations),"Hi all,
Class Charts say the photo sync issue lies with SIMS.

Holly,
Please could you apply the SIMS patch mentioned, as we don't have it
installed already:
[image: image.png]

This is different to the one discussed earlier in the week, which became
available after the two big summer updates:
[image: image.png]
It seems we may need them all, as the 2 big 'Summer Consolidated
Workstation' patches haven't fixed the issues.

Can you let me/Class Charts know once this is done.
*We won't get the photos synced across until this is completed and they do
a manual sync.*

Hi Vanessa,

SIMS had an issue with the summer release which prevented the photo report
from running on Wonde.

They've since resolved this and Wonde have advised that the patch below
will resolve the issue on SIMS:

Patch Number: 28262

Patch Description: Fix to resolve the reporting crash for On Roll students
after summer 2023 upgrade.

If you can let me know once that has been applied and I'll trigger the
report manually and run a sync to update the account.

Best Wishes,

Mark

  We uploaded new photos to our SIMS on 25/9/23, but so far they have not
been synced across. Your support page says that Xporter/XoD sync Fridays,
but we use Wonde. I have checked our Wonde connection, and all appears well.
Please could the photos be synced as soon as possible.

SIMS holds all the latest photos, but the Class Charts (via Wonde) sync has
not worked.

According to their support page, worst case scenario is they will sync
across on Friday, but Wonde isn't listed in this weekly sync delay:

Wonde has been checked, and looks to be working fine.
I have left a request for support via their webpage.

In the meantime, please do not upload any external photos, but copy from

,T20230927.0155,A few issues,"Good morning

We are having some issues with our computers in the office:

1. Ever so often the desktop appears to ""refresh"" and in doing so, if I
have several document folders open they will be closed down. As you can
imagine if I am working on several different tasks this is quite
frustrating as i use it to keep track of multiple projects. I can imagine
that it is a memory saving task but it is  frustrating.

2. Related to the former, we use the Desktop Authy app to generate a code
to log in to the School office account (Outlook maintained by CYC). Whilst
you provided us with the software to install on both machines, some form of
update or refresh has happened and it has lost all the details again within
all profiles. therefore we have to set it up again (for the third time this
year due to this issue). We can't use our phones on phone network within
the building and don't want to install work software on personal devices.
We have found a work around, but again this has caused quite a bit of
disruption to our working morning.

I hope that you can clarify and help.

Many Thanks

Would I be able to spend 10mins with you to discuss Video Coursework for our A-Level groups, please?  ...specifically how to up-load and store on One-drive for students to be able to access and staff to view - preferably without duplication??  I'm a bit lost with it.  Hopefully a simple solution.

Possible times;

We're struggling a bit to upload photos to the google drive from the staff
iPads, and obviously can't use cables to link them to the computer.
Uploading the photos directly to the Google Drive doesn't seem to be an
option. Is it possible to install the Google Drive app to all of the new
staff iPads, to allow us to upload things to the drive?
Many thanks,

Can you give me an update on how things are going with these last few requests please


  1.  Has the shared ‘U’ drive been moved over to google yet, if not will you let us know when this will be ready so we can inform staff



  1.  ‘Complete maths’ profile when will this be ready to roll out to staff



  1.  Some of our laptops have not been upgraded to Windows 11 (these ones weren’t ready for renewal but need to be upgraded)  Joe said I need to say they need a Window 11 build but not sure if that is to be added to the server or laptops 😊


  1.  My laptop, I couldn’t download anything at the weekend. I was told these new laptops had lots of memory and this wouldn’t be a problem again for me……HELP!!


Sorry to hound you but I’m being hounded, (except for no.4)  so I have to pass it on 😊

Thanks

Would it be possible for someone to come and take a look at some work that

We are looking to install a new system in the kitchen for Hutchisons but it
needs an Ethernet cable running from the port in the hall to the kitchen
counter.  Also, we are changing the layout of the school office and need
some advice on how to run the cables as the plan is to have the desks in
the middle of the room instead of the side of the room where the trunking
is.

Thanks

Hi Marcus

I think it might be worth resetting them all so that at least school has a copy, is this possible? It's interesting as the teacher just popped in and he said none of them can remember their logins!!!

I have attached a spreadsheet with all their names, plus two new pupils who have just joined us

also please can we delete these children's accounts as they have left

,T20230922.0212,Music L Drive Update,"Hi James

I don't envy you at all at the moment - I know you're swamped.

Tim mentioned something about a separate space/'L:Drive' for the Music dept to fulfill our storage/accessibility needs for all year groups. He said Dan is putting it together?

I just wondered if there'd been any progress with this yet. We're limping on but it's not sustainable for long, with students having to save copies of projects in home folders, which staff can't then access. Y11 and Y13 are into the coursework slog, with Y10 and Y12 also needing to access Cubase project templates for projects etc. It'll get pretty desperate pretty soon.

Let me know if there's any more info or anything you need from me to help set this up. Tim and I can only keep the other Music staff's anxiety about this at bay for so long... 😂

Thanks

I mentioned briefly this morning that we've been having problems for
sometime now with wifi coverage in Staveley school. The wifi can be quite
intermittent in the office, which although isn't a problem for our Admin as
she's on a wired connection, other staff use the adjacent office on laptops
and it's very hit & miss. I got in touch with NYES Digital as I thought it
may be them that would look at this as our broadband is with them, but
they've said it would be you.  Could someone have a look at some point to
see if there's anything you can suggest we do?

Thanks,

Lewis has brought his laptop in as he is having difficulty with his laptop

reads 50%). When using it at home he needs to keep it plugged in all the
time but this makes it difficult for him to use as there is not a plug by
his desk. Is there any way for you to replace the battery for him?

Since returning this term no one has been able to post tweets on twitter. I
logged this with Talk straight and after various attempts to fix it still
isn't. They have now come back to me with the following.
Would it be possible for someone to attend to do this on the Ipads then
apply the DHCP while they are here please?

Many Thanks

Dear Karen

The case has been investigated and resolved as follows:

Following our conversation if you access the iPad and then:

Open the Settings app, then tap Wi-Fi.
Tap the More Info button. next to a network.
Tap to turn Private Wi-Fi Address off

you will then need to contact EBOR and ask them to apply a DHCP reservation.

once this has been completed email Support@talk-straight and request the IP
address (that ebor provide) and ask for it to be added to the staff filter
group.

Should this case not be resolved to your satisfaction please reply to this
email within 7 days and it will automatically be re-opened.

Keeping the following reference in the email reply will automatically
update the case with your reply:-

Kind regards,

CTS

Good Morning,

The projector in J09 doesn't appear to be bright enough, I cannot use the visualiser as students can't see what is on screen and they struggle to see the PowerPoints I display too. I'm not sure if it needs a new bulb as the colour appears to be off too.

Thanks

I have a contract with Pathfinder (now retired as a Headteacher) supporting
schools and use a Dell laptop supplied by PMAT through Vital.

I seem to have lost my link to the Microsoft Office package which I have
been using on my Pathfinder laptop.  It was giving me access to all the
usual programmes but now these are all greyed out on the start menu.

I can get into my current docs using Word, and create a new document that
way.  Is this something you could look into for me?  I am continuing to
work with a PMAT contract so this is important.

Please can you help?

A bit of a random one.

Teachers can access YouTube but when some of them try and maximise the
screen while playing a video - Google crashes.  It can also happen on other
sites such as CBBC.

It also doesn't seem to happen on all computers and not for all teachers (
I wonder if it might be linked to the person's account rather than the
computer?)
It's irritating rather than a huge problem (as you can still watch things
on a smaller screen)
Hope that makes sense!  Is there anything that can be done.

,T20230919.0206,MFL printer,"Hello there,

I know you've managed to get us back onto the MFL printer, which is quite a relief, but I'm afraid we are having some more issues with it since it's been re-jigged:


  1.  It seems to be accessible outside of the department, meaning that we have had all kinds of random stuff coming out
  2.  Because it's now coming out automatically, if someone is trying to copy at the same time without realising, we're ending up with paper jams, unintentional coloured paper, etc. - it's a nightmare
  3.  If we need coloured paper for certain individuals, we now have to print AND copy rather than just putting sheets in before releasing the job.
  4.  I've noticed that it now costs twice as much per sheet, even though it's not one of the little machines like in maths!

Is it possible to get it back onto the Papercut release system please?

Thanks,
Sarah

Good afternoon,

The YouTube access for the school has been stopped again.  The teachers use
YouTube for calming music, the fireplace image etc.  please could the
access be granted again?

Also,  please our catering manager be added onto the school's network so
that she can access emails from the kitchen?

Finally, the telephone in the Hedgehogs classroom is not working (it has
been taken for repair previously, but is not working again.

I have recently had my PC replaced and I mentioned the keys were sticking
on my keyboard so Marcus replaced it, but he only had one with a lead, but
he said that he would replace it with a wireless.

Is this possible, as the lead is slightly too short for where I want it to

Can  you help?  The attached link opens a powerpoint presentation that I
can play with sound.  I need to send it to all tutors in Y8 but when I try
to attach it to an email, it converts into Google slides. When it is in
Google slides format, I can't hear the sound.  When I zip the file, it
still converts it to Google slides when I attach it to the email...

Can  you help me to share it with tutors so that they can play the slides
with sound somehow??  I need to send it out to them tomorrow so they can
play it during tutor time on Wednesday.

to print photos - at the moment we have to download them onto a laptop and
then print them.

Subject: Wigginton Canon Printer/Photocopier

Hi Adam,

A while ago I asked you about helping us with the Wigginton School Canon photocopier as it's not linked to staff ID cards or allow for individual codes for printing, so if staff send anything to the printer it can be printed off by anyone.

I've had many discussions with Canon during which they've tried to sell me expensive additional software. Finally they've told me of something called Uniflow Online Express Cloud which supports a PIN code for device access. Apparently, this is customer installable. When I asked for more information on how to install it, they sent me a link and told me to direct my IT provider to it.

Is this something you can help us with please?

Please can the computer be moved onto the full size desk which is in the room, it is placed perfectly but the computer would need moving and the leads made safe.

I teach in there the majority of the time with classes of 32 and they are unable to see the board as the monitor is blocking the view for those sat on the far left hand side.

Also, the projector is not clear, showing a reddish colour. This is making it difficult for students to see worksheets when using the visualiser.

Can you let me know when this could be done?

Many thanks,

Dear Fishergate Primary School,



I am Karim Shaker, Customer Life Cycle Manager UK and your Microsoft point
of contact.



It's a pleasure to have a call to meet and greet and discuss with you
regarding the upcoming OVS Renewal and see the opportunity for new business.



I wanted to introduce myself and see how I can be of help.



So as you may know that the OVS agreement is going to be expired by the end
of the year and to make sure everything you purchased before still be
running we can transfer the same agreement into a Certified Microsoft
Partner( Cloud service provider).



Also I'm thinking of having discussion on upgrading your licenses and
talking about the security features that Microsoft can support with, so
what do you think ?



Please feel free to book a meeting with me using this link at your
convenient time:Book time with Karim Shaker (International Supplier):

I look forward to speaking with you soon.

It also won't allow me to play videos on exploring and states this is due
to a pop up. We aren't sure if some sort of pop up blocker is stopping me
saving the dinner register too.

Thanks,
Helena

Please could these be looked at ASAP as it is stopping the teachers being
able to teach their lessons as they can't use/set up a classroom etc.

- Unable to make a google classroom, even if you click that you are a
teacher it is asking for a classroom code to be added to a class.

- Unable to use embedded videos in google slides.

- Some slide decs show in creation mode - but when you use the slide show
they are not there.

- Our portable office phone is not working properly. It keeps dying despite
being on charge.

- Can we have group email set up for the classes so that the teachers are
able to email their class as a group.

- Do you have a date for when somebody is able to come and look at getting
wifi in our new Nurture room?

Hi Ben,

Hope you're well.

I'll need to get onto the PBX to get you the details you need for changing
the messages, but I'm unable to connect. I think this is because your
system is locked down to our old office IP address and it's no longer used.

Can you set the router/firewall up for our new connection?

Traffic from 68.183.33.233 needs to go to TCP port 35300 and then be
forwarded to 10.10.84.51

Kind regards,

Ric

a support contract with you and we require instructions on how to change
the voicemail messages on the phones at the school. I've also been told we

,T20230911.0121,MCE Account issues,"So at Manor, we've had several new members of staff join and since their accounts have been generated there have been a number of issues surrounding them.

The new SIM admin has made a pigs ear out of it so at the minute of the new users that started in September none of them have any printing budgets being applied to their accounts and for one user, when they log into edulink they get another member of staffs edulink account. The staff member is m.jarvis and when she logs into edulink with her account it brings up the edulink account (timetables and all) of m.slattery. I have confirmed the LDAP number is correct in AD for each account with the help of Claire Mumford but still the issue persists. 

I've gone through AD, added the appropriate budgets to the right accounts, and done a sync on PaperCut to update the groups and their members but none of the new staff are able to see any budgets on the Papercut window when they go to print so atm I am giving them credit on their personal budgets and letting them charge to that instead. An example of this is c.parlsey, I have applied the science printer group and the science budget group, and the user is able to print to the science printer but the PaperCut window that allows you to choose the budget and other parameters doesn't show any budgets in the drop down.",,Vital York Limited,Primary Address,,Complete,High,,,"Crolla, Ben",Vital York Technicians,Vital Escalations,Service Request,ATG MSP Support,ATG Printing (Basic),,,,,,,,,,VYL - Incidents,11/09/2023 09:12 AM,"Crolla, Ben",,17/10/2023 08:59 AM,02/10/2023 10:42 AM,17/10/2023 08:47 AM,"Crolla, Ben",,"Crolla, Ben",Not Visible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lack of Environmental Knowledge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hello, I am Jaeho Jung who was Arch's student.
I finished secondary school, but I still used my arch's email;

However, this email is disabled since 1 Sep.
Since I have used this account for my university, I still need this account.
I wonder if arch's make this account block and if it is, please let me use
it again.

Thank you

I have recently had my PC replaced and I mentioned the keys were sticking
on my keyboard so Marcus replaced it, but he only had one with a lead, but
he said that he would replace it with a wireless.

Is this possible, as the lead is slightly too short for where I want it to
be?

Many thanks

The school have called to say they are having quite a few issues at the moment.

Would you be able to call the school today and let them know when you're going, I told them it might not be until next week they would just like a time and date as to when, so feel free to chose any time that is suitable for you.

There is a handful of iPads that won't connect to the Wi-Fi (Wifi details should be in ITGlu, under St James)
Mags has a laptop in the office that needs repairing but her current replacement device won't connect to the printers
The head of the school Julia knows all about these, whenever you go to site ask for her and she should be able to show you.

,T20230907.0341,Wifi issues,"Hi Guys,

Since the students return, the wifi has been quite ropey. There’s been a large amount of AP’s crashing and stopping connecting clients through to the internet.

A restart on the Access point seems to fix this, but we are getting a large amount of them crashing per day,

I was going to restart the network from the core up this evening. But is there anything else you can think of doing to resolve this. Im aware that an amount of it will be students ipads that haven’t been switched on for 6 weeks pulling a huge amount of data to run updates and so on.

Is there any other errors that you can see on out network that im missing?


Thanks

,T20230906.0416,Smoothwall secondary line,"Hi guys,

I spoke to james last week about our smoothwall external connection lines. We have 2 1gbs leased lines here and I was of the understanding that  line 1 was our priority line with a failback to line 2.

We realised that one day last week that this load balancing was not working.

Would it be possible to turn the load balancing feature on so that we send traffic down both lines. Were suffering a bit with 1100 students who haven’t had their ipad turned on for 6 weeks looking for updates !

Thanks

I am not sure how many of these work as a few were having issues with wifi

staff and only replaced on the last day.

I have 29 in my Year 10 class - all needing regular access to a chromebook

In S11 Mel is able to extend her screen but the screen is treated as
computer 1, which doesn't work.

Thanks in advance for any help you can give.

Best wishes,
Sophie

I hope you're all well.

Is there any chance that someone could bob across to New Earswick Primary
tomorrow morning (Thursday 31st) to resolve any techy issues that the staff
are having please?  Lots of them are sharing issues about products not
working on their new laptops and the office team's desk tops have not been
connected either.  We're all in tomorrow for a training day before the
children are back in on Monday so it would be the perfect day for support
so that staff are not feeling worried about not having working things for
Monday?

Also, any news on my new Head laptop please?  I've still not been informed
about its whereabouts and I need one to connect it to the hall projector
for my slides for my presentation tomorrow afternoon.

Apparently new upgrade to Heritage specifically non-hosted.

Any chance? Or put it on job list.

Thank you

Dawn

---------- Forwarded message ---------
From: Emma Duffield <emma@isoxford.com>
Date: Tue, 25 Jul 2023, 08:15
Subject: Upgrade news - Heritage Cirqa 5.7a and Look4 now available
To: d.rawling@gra.hlt.academy <d.rawling@gra.hlt.academy>


*Heritage Cirqa 5.7a is now available!*



Good morning all,

I am delighted to announce that the latest upgrade, Heritage Cirqa 5.7a, is
now available for download from our support website.



This upgrade is specifically for non-hosted Heritage Cirqa customers who
are currently on versions 5.6, 5.6a, or 5.6b.



Whilst the Heritage Cirqa upgrade itself is straightforward, it will
require some preparation from your IT colleagues. They will need to install
two important Windows components prior to running the upgrade (IIS URL
ReWrite and the .Net 6 hosting bundle). Full details of these, including
links to download them, are given in the upgrade helpsheet
https://cirqasupport.com/HI136.



There are some steps that you can do prior to the upgrade too – just a few
checks and housekeeping tasks. The instructions are in the helpsheet but
Tom is recording a short video and will upload it to
https://cirqasupport.com/VG56 later today.



*Should I apply the upgrade?*



I know that many of you are keen to get your hands on Look4. It is worth
mentioning, however that there will be at least one further upgrade
following on this summer as we add more functionality. If you work in an
academic library and staff are term-time only then you may decide to wait
until staff return and then apply whichever is the latest upgrade then, as
they will be cumulative. If you normally require IT assistance to run the
client as an administrator following the upgrade then you will need to do
this for the 5.7a upgrade.



Highlights of the upgrade are as follows:



*The new Look4 online catalogue interface*



There is lots to say about Look4 so please go to
https://cirqasupport.com/look4 for all the details. It is important to note
that you can continue to offer your users your existing Heritage Online
whilst you familiarise yourself with Look4 and populate the widgets with
your own content. There is no rush to switch to Look4; you can decide when
it's most convenient for you.



*Automatic index update*



Whether you use Heritage Online or Look4, your online catalogue will be
updated with new items as you catalogue them now, rather than being updated
on a scheduled basis. If you are doing lots of cataloguing you might wish
to temporarily turn this off – this can be set in the UPDATEINDEX
configuration value.



*Increased password security*



With the introduction of Look4, more secure reader passwords have been
introduced to replace the old reader PINs. If you are using single sign-on
you can continue to do so. If you are switching from PINs, however, the new
passwords are set by the reader via Look4 using the ‘Reset password’
option. If you would prefer to keep PINs for now you can set the new
KEEP.PINS configuration to Yes. Whatever the KEEP.PINS setting, the reader
will be able to use their old PIN until they change it via Look4, at which
point they will generate a new password and will no longer be able to use
their old PIN.



For a full list of the changes and fixes in version 5.7a please see
https://cirqasupport.com/HI137.



I hope you find this useful.



Best wishes,



Emma

Susie will now contact the departments as you suggested.

Can you please give us a quotation for the new software and hardware

We can then look at the feasibility of this.

Good afternoon Elanor,

Thank you very much for your email.

You are correct, Mike has now left Agilico.

We have already appointed Mikes replacement, from within our ranks so the
good news is we know you’ll have a capable and reliable account manager,
however as he currently works as an account manger in our software
division, he won’t be in his new in post until the first of September. In
the meantime, I’m afraid, you’ll have to make do with me! In all
seriousness, I am here to support you in whatever you need, so please reach
out to me if you or Mark have any queries or requirements. I will, of
course, make sure we introduce James, your new Account Manager, to you both
when he starts his new role.

You may have seen I have also included Chris Wright and Mo Uddin, who’ll
oversee the organisation of installation of your new machines. Mo is away
this week but I’m sure between them, they will be able to ensure your
installation is well organised and will run smoothly. They will call you to
book the date, organise our IT support, and ensure any other relevant
details are considered.

I hope this email covers all you need for now. As mentioned above, if you
have any requirements, please let me know and I’ll be happy to help.

Best wishes,

Nick.

Hi Nick,



I hope you are well?



It's my understanding Mike finished on the 7th July.



Could you please tell me who my new contact will be to schedule the
delivery of the new machines for George Pindar school? I have cc'd in Mark
Ward the Support Services Manager for the school who will coordinate
delivery.



I emailed Michelle last week but I believe she is on annual leave so I was
provided with your email by someone in the office when I called.



Kind regards,

Would it be possible for someone to come and spend some time 'servicing'

dodgy but we feel like we are chasing our tails somewhat.

Moving forward, would it be possible to book someone in to give them a
quick health check every month?  Usually wouldn't be a big job but we've
let it get on top of us and would mean that we could collect any items that
appear to need checking.

Thanks,

Please can you let my laptop ask me if I want to save passwords?

Many thanks, Caren

,T20230609.0022,DHCP Scope Full?,"Hi there,

Over the past week, we've been having an issue where a computer will not
connect to the network sometimes. After re-running DHCP (e.g rebooting,
ipconfig /renew) the computer will reconnect. Laurence has suggested this
is because the scope is running out of IPs.

I've had a look and including reservations, it looks like we have 98% of
the scope in use, and together we could remove a few, but most of the
devices in the scope are still in use.

Could we look into expanding the scope somehow, or is this another
unrelated issue entirely?

Thanks,

,T20230605.0211,Photo Sync for tills,"Hi Kevin,

Please can I re-add this to your list.

It is really important that we get to the bottom of how the tills are
synced with photos in time for September - not having them causes us a big
issue.

Not urgent but if you could reopen the investigation I would be grateful.

Thanks
Sam
