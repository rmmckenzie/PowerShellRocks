Hi Jimmy,



It's been happening for a while now and I wasn't sure if I had reported it
to you yet. It seems that a lot of voicemails that parents are leaving for
attendance are getting sent to the Lettings voicemail inbox, which is
Stacey Stump. We don't have access to this and parents are getting very
angry that we're chasing up their child's absence when they've already left
a message.



Please could we look into this being resolved?

Thanks!

now we have a procurement officer, I no longer need to receive these
messages. Please remove t.moat@ from the list.

Please also confirm that Helen Taylor (h.taylor@) will be receiving these

Weirdly, Helen says she received one yesterday but didn't get the one that
came in to me just now?

Hi Dawn,
I think you will need the helpdesk  cc'd in that case. It should be the
same login details as your windows sign in.
@help@vitalyork.co.uk <help@vitalyork.co.uk>  Please can you contact Dawn
and resolve, the RDS service is important for Dawn to carry out her role.
I can't reset anything in relation to the Remote Desktop and the Helpdesk

,T20231129.0178,Dexter Reynolds - maths chromebook ban,"Just to let you all know that I have banned Dexter Reynolds from using any
of the maths chromebooks.

This morning in tutor time I asked him to place the chromebook on the table
to use it instead of balancing it on one knee precariously.

He refused to do this on 3 occasions and was also holding it up by the
screen - even though he received a code for continuing to refuse to follow
this request.

I therefore informed him to log off the chromebook so I could put it away
as he was not following instructions.

To this Dexter shoved the chromebook violently across the table by the
screen, nearly sending it flying onto the floor.

I have made it very clear to Dexter that this behaviour and abuse of school
resources will not be tolerated and he is now permanently banned from the
use of any of the maths chromebooks.

Lee / Tim - I will leave it up to you both if you feel the ban on
chromebooks needs to be across school rather than just the maths ones.

At Scarcroft Primary School, we wish to encourage staff to have a healthy
work-life balance, and therefore we discourage the sending of emails
outside of the traditional working day. Where emails are received after
6pm, over the weekend or during a holiday period, it is likely that a
response will be given during the school’s normal working hours. Thank you
in advance for your understanding in helping us to promote a happy, healthy

My year 11's are about to submit their drama coursework and a couple of them appear to have lost their work.

They have both said they pressed save as yesterday and judging by their reactions and panic I'm fairly certain they did. However it's not showing up.

They worked on laptops from po5/6 last week, ro6 yesterday and po5 today.

Any ideas or is it lost forever.

,T20231129.0019,Fully funded courses.,"From ""Nick Porter"" <the.team@wefindanylearner.co.uk>: Hello,

We are absolutely thrilled to announce that we are offering not one, not two, but THREE of our most popular online courses completely free of charge! Yes, you heard that right - FREE!

But don't wait too long to register your interest, as spots are filling up fast. This is an incredible opportunity that you won't want to miss out on. You can easily sign up on our website at www.wefindanylearner.com/book-online/ or by contacting our team at 01226 958 888.

All you need to do is meet a few simple criteria, including being at least 19 years old by August 31st, 2022, residing in England, and not currently enrolled in an apprenticeship program.

Enrol today and let's make a difference together!

Counselling Skills Level 2
Many people find it helpful to seek counselling at some point in their lives, and a counsellor can provide support for people in all sorts of situations. If you’re interested in supporting people to improve their personal well-being, this course will provide you with the correct understanding, knowledge and skills to do that. You’ll learn about core counselling skills and how to use them in a counselling relationship. You will also be taught about counselling theory and the ethical framework that informs how counsellors use their skills.

Mental Health First Aid Level 2
It’s important that employers are transparent and open about mental health issues, and this qualification builds an understanding of mental health problems and the support available to colleagues. Increasing the understanding of the mental health of staff at all levels builds a culture of care and support.

Understanding Autism Level 2
This course will give you an understanding of autism and the principles of supporting individuals with autism. You will look at the person-centred approach and the influence that positive communication methods can have and will gain an understanding of how individuals with autism can be supported to live healthy and fulfilled lives.

We have two more Chromebooks that aren't turning on at all, I will leave
them in our main reception for collection. We also have one further
Chromebook that brings up the message of 'missing IOS' that I think means
it needs 'powerwashing' based on past conversations, I will leave this at
main reception also for collection.

We are running really low on machines so if they could be sorted ASAP, that
would be massively appreciated.

My PC is constantly refreshing the screen - to the point when I can not do
anything as it refreshes before I click anything.

It looks like a key is stuck etc but I cannot see anything stuck. I cannot
make it stop refreshing.

I am emailing from my Chromebook  now but will need PC for lessons. I will

Hi Katy,

To better understand the negative effects of vaping on schools, we
commissioned a comprehensive study of teen vaping. The results showed us
that:

   - 77% of teens consider it easy to vape at school
   - 61% of vaping teens consider themselves addicted
   - Vaping occurs most often in school bathrooms
   - Around 90% of teachers believe it to be disruptive to the learning
   environment

Vaping is clearly a major issue across schools.

Let us know if you would like to better understand how Verkada's systems
help students by discouraging vaping.

Best,

Kevin

Katy,

Hope to have caught you at a good time this Thursday!

The reason I am reaching out, Katy, is that I would love to get a chance to
show you how our cutting edge vaping sensors, security cameras and alarm
systems are helping technology professionals at schools like Archbishop
Holgate's School monitor and respond to vaping incidents, improve
safeguarding and simplify technical infrastructure. All this from the palms
of their hands.

Katy, if you are interested in learning more, I would be keen to book you
in for a quick 1:1 demo with one of our trained product specialists.

I look forward to hearing from you!

,T20231127.0264,Laptop unusable,"Hi Lee

I have tried using my laptop tonight at home and it is now completely
unusable.

I open something up and it stays open for about 1 minute before then just
closing itself.

This is with any program I try and use - even emails.

I’ll bring it back in tomorrow and leave it in my office but I’m on a
course all day (although it is in Graham school).

We have YoYo coming into school next week to deliver RE lessons. They have
asked whether they are able to plug their own laptops in via HDMI and
display a PowerPoint presentation on the IWB. With all the issues we had
before, is this possible? They have said converting to Google Slides means
they lose some of the interactivity but they have over a week until they
are coming in, so should be able to fix the issues.

Many thanks,
Imogen

We seem to have a number of catering staff who are in the ASJ teachers
group on email? This is a bit bizarre as they should be on the All ASI
staff group for the infant school.

Is it possible to have a list of the teacher groups for both schools so
that I can correct any errors there? We had Ofsted last week and the Head
was sending quite confidential emails out which definitely didn't need to
go to catering staff!

Thanks in advance
Kind regards

We have a staff member who is leaving at the end of December. As their
email address is often used to communicate by some parents and external
organisations we would rather not have it disabled without an automated
message with an alternative contact being provided. Please can you advise
if it is an option for you to add an automated message to the email for a
set period of time and also stop the staff member having access to the
emails and the system etc?

Charlotte,

Just passing on the “Prevent” training I’ve completed (attached) and also
asking for some help with my Pathfinder email address. Liz Raspa said to
access it via gmail but I haven’t been able to log in - wondering if the
password might have expired and need updating?

If you could help or point me in the right direction that would be great.

Thanks,

Neil

It's a session on Motor Vehicle aimed at our more disengaged students (delivered by Yoro College).



We're looking at 20-30 students attending



My concern with CO3 is it's a bit of an awkward room re behaviour management and probably not big enough...

I am contacting you with regards to our school account.  I am able to sign into our account as admin, but the classes and pupils were added to the system via a google account and I do not have access to this.

I have spoken with our ICT department regarding this unfortunately, they are unable to help as they need to have an admin account themselves -  could you please add the following email with all admin rights to your system

Could you please inform me when this has been done so I can let ICT know.

Please could I have book the dining hall Wednesday P4/5.

James, can you confirm if the projector in the main hall has a HDMI connection please as the presenter needs one.

Chirs, Gill and team, would it be possible to get the dining hall cleaned and set up (for about 20-40 students), with walls pulled across by the start of P4 (or just after)?

Thanks

I emailed back and they said:

They will open in Smart notebook which is a free download. (If you speak to

Would you be able to download this for me please?

Hi Sue

Please could you email a message to Russ at Vital for me? I don’t have his
email address and he’s not answering his phone.  He’s been helping me to
access the Google account. Please could you tell him that I’ve found my
password and have been able to log in. He told me I’d logged in 4 weeks
ago, which jogged my memory and I was able to search my paperwork and find
the password.

Many thanks
Sue

I've got it working so he shouldn't need to change anything. Works on the mezz computers at least. Using the C drive's Java 20 JDK instead of the one on the J drive, seems like there's incompatibility with some of the eclipse GUI and older Java versions that was breaking when creating run configurations.

Thanks,

Just a follow up on this, I've (possibly) got it running with the Java 20 JDK on the C drives instead of 17 which was what we were using previously.

Not 100% sure that this completely works (and I haven't tested Onedrive compatibility) but hopefully this should work. I'll test it properly but possibly vital won't need to do anything else.

Thanks,

Sam

,T20231124.0097,Plug in microphones?,"Hi Mike

When Sarah and I were completing speaking tests some of the students were
talking very quietly and for those students the audio has been very poor
and some will lose marks if this is the same in the real thing.

We were wondering if there were any microphones in school that we would be
able to use for the next set of mocks and the real thing that would plug
into a laptop? This way we can place a standing microphone right next to
the student and hopefully pick up their voice better.

We record on the software 'Audacity' which works well for saving and naming
the MP3s.

We would ideally want to try out the tech with some quiet students asap so
we know if it's ok. :) No massive rush but on the 'to srt' list.

Merci!

,T20231123.0226,SIMS still not working - sorry,"Hi Mike,

I`m sorry to be a pain about SIMS (again) but mines still not working in my
office.  It's currently not letting me even log-in to the programme.

Please could you have a look at it tomorrow as everytime I'm trying to
alter any details about a student's SEN, it's continuing to 'not respond'
or 'timeout' or 'SIMS fault'!

The latest screenshot is below as I can`t even get the programme to load
tonight!

I`m not in school tomorrow so if you could have a look at my machine, I`d
be very grateful.

Thanks

[You don't often get email from anisa.nurein@gmail.com. Learn why this is important at https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification ]

Good evening,

I am just writing as I was trying to sign into my email to find information about an ASDAN course I did, which I was told about through school, however I am locked out of the email now. I assume this is because I went to college, so didn’t need it for sixth form, but now I am trying to write about the course on my personal statement but can’t get into my huntington email to find what the ASDAN course was called and who sent me my certificate after the course.

Thank you,
Anisa

Hi,

These are the error messages we are getting on the pc's and I screen shot the connection to show that it was saying it was connected.

Mike can get on things on his laptop on WIFI but when he puts in an ethernet cable it then has the same issues?

The phone in Y5 St Nicholas hasn't worked since the start of the year, and
I can't find a way of plugging it in. It means there's no phone across Year

Hi Sarah
Ruth has a medical appointment on Thursday am so can you book supply and
say work will be left?

Also can you contact Vital and ask that supply teachers have access to the
staff shared drive on the server ( not Google drive). They used to but it
didn’t work last time I tried.
There’s no way teachers can leave electronic work otherwise.

Hi Amanda, Cam is working well in photography although he can struggle to retain information. Today using photoshop he could not remember some of the basics and I had to remind him. He does seem to rely on Aiden for technical support.
He would really benefit from doing more work outside the lesson.


On another note, it seems that your school has blocked students from accessing their Adobe accounts so they are unable to do work in their free periods. Is this something that can be rectified.
Thanks

,T20231123.0066,VNC - ongoing issues at HMP,"Hi,

I was in Hob Moor Primary yesterday to do a refresher on iPad apps with a student. They had previously commented how useful VNC Team Viewer was last year but they didn't have it this year.  I believe this is now available on the teachers device and it is definitely on the students iPad, however the class teacher says it isn't working.  There is a password or teacher email needed who is no longer there, so they cannot get it to work. Please can someone visit again to get them logged in and VNC working?  I'm next visiting this student on either 13th or 14th December.

The student also needs an external mouse for her Chromebook and for the touchpad to be disabled, as she is touching the touchpad/mousepad when she is practicing her touch typing and an external mouse is better for children with VI due to their hand/eye coordination.

Thanks for your help with this.

Best wishes,
Abi

attached set-up questionnaire for each of the schools.  I've completed what
I can, but need to ask your advice for a few of the more technical
questions.  Could you please have a look at the questions highlighted
yellow on the attached?  I'm assuming the responses will be same for all 3
of our schools.  If you could also check through the other answers I've
given that would be appreciated.  I don't think it will take you very long.

If there's any chance you could get back to me by tomorrow that would be
really appreciated, as we want to get this set up asap.

Thanks,
Carrie

,T20231123.0034,Re: Pietro A,"Hi,

I showed Pietro in form this morning. He should know how to go from his
personal to his school email address, and I told him to let me know
straight away if this happens again and he forgets how to sort it.

Charlotte, I see that he got a detention for this homework that he wasn't
able to do because of this technical problem. Would it be appropriate to
give him an extension to complete the homework before giving him the
detention?

Hi Kyle

I problem I had and have had in the past is that the smoothwall blocks the
Google Teams link from my VOY Google account. I had to log onto my personal
account and use the link from there. If you would raise it with IT support
that would be great.

Many thanks

Please could you ask Vital to block Run 3 Unblocked- it is a game that the UP can access and it has no educational value unless you like falling down rabbit holes.

Hi

Please see below the correspondence with James, as there seems to be conflicting information - could we get clarification on the settings?

Our engineer made another visit to site yesterday to attempt to get site online - this is probably our 4th visit!

We need to make sure the info is correct before we attend again as this is wasted cost - Maple Controls expense

The printer in the library is being weird.
When scanning my card to log in it will not bring up my account and just
lights up a display that does not let you carry out any actions other than
informing about some stats to do with the printer.
It does not let you manually input any username etc either so not a
card reader issue.

log on, and whilst it appears at first to accept my credentials, it then
gives an error message:

,T20231122.0135,Google TV setup,"Hi,
Yesterday, Jonny spent some time here helping to connect our
Chromecast/Google TV device to the internet. I was then able to sign into a
Google account this morning.

However, the device has now lost the connection and won't connect to our
school wifi. I can get it working(ish) if I use my mobile data hotspot but
this is obviously unsustainable.

Please could someone come and have a look at it again?
Thanks,
Luke

Please see below the correspondence with James, as there seems to be 
conflicting information - could we get clarification on the settings?

Our engineer made another visit to site yesterday to attempt to get site 
online - this is probably our 4th visit!

We need to make sure the info is correct before we attend again as this 
is wasted cost - Maple Controls expense

We have a tv in the fitness suite that we plug a Chromebook into to put
music and fitness classes in the screen but there is currently no signal in
there so we can’t use it. We used to have a chrome cast plugged in but
that, obviously, also doesn’t work either.

There were issues last year with which network we could connect to but
there seems to be no network available. My phone also doesn’t connect to
any wifi in there so playing music from my phone is also difficult unless
downloaded.

Please could a solution be found asap.

I think James needs to update SIMS on it.
It would be worth trying the computer in the office and see if you're getting the same problem.
I'll get onto James again to update SIMS in 22.
Thanks
T

I'm assuming this is the same issue that we had with Donna and some of the other machines in Music.
Are you able to update SIMS on the machines in P21/P22 and P23?

,T20231122.0017,Laser cutter installation today- final instructions,"Hi, just an update about today. Our technician is absent so not able to
support this morning.

You have the hardware, so need to pass to the HPC laser cutter technician
when they arrive.

I am teaching lesson 1 and 2 in G2, so will be in the same room with them.
They will need escorting to there I imagine. I will keep the PC’s free from
students next to the laser cutter.

The power for the laser cutter is in the store room, I will make sure it is
on this morning.


The key to switch on the laser cutter will be with me in G2 lesson 1 and 2.
I will then leave the key on the teaching desk, it has a small poppy and a
green acrylic fob on it.

I then have break duty outside the library and after that will have Y11 in
F5 (normally they would be in G2).

Then I am back in G2 in the afternoon for the training on the laser cutter.

Miriam is taking my lesson 4 class- food.

Cover will be teaching my lesson 5 class in F5 (room change), so hopefully
we will not be disturbed.

If you need anything else just message or pop into G2 after 0840

Thanks

,T20231122.0014,Photocopier printing,"Good morning
I am auditing our schools GDPR practices and have come across something
which we really need to sort and I am hoping you can help. I have been to 2
schools so far, Tadcaster and Haxby Road.
Haxby Road have 2 photocopiers in an open corridor  which are easily
accessible by anyone passing by. None of their printing is password
protected and so anyone could print up jobs sent to this printer. When I
checked at both schools, there were documents on the printer from other
schools' staff and the CST. For example a member of CST's printing of P60s
and wage slips of other members of staff was easily accessible. Both of
these issues could be classed as a data breach. Would it be possible for us
to rollout password protection to all staff so print outs are secure?

Happy to chat this through.

Wendy

,T20231121.0214,Computing Resources,"Good evening,

I was wondering if we could assess any recording devices for our children
to make a podcast with as part of their computing learning for this half
term. I would ideally need them for a week and for it to be compatible with
Chromebooks as the children will be using these for their learning.

I was also wondering if someone would be available to come and set up the
teachers' visualizers as I've been told we need a specific piece of
software to do this?

Any suggestions or advice would be much appreciated!
Thanks,
Emily Cryar

Morning

I am having issues with Windows and Google syncing this week. I have made a new user and the sync is not working. I can see them in AD but when I sync it's not going to Google. Do you know if anything has changed in the last couple of days?  It was working fine last week.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks
Lewis

Hi Nicky,

Do you know if there's any update from Vital about getting a new plug for
my chrome book trolley? I still have one that I can't charge as the

Thank you

Although some more RAM was added to my laptop a couple of weeks ago it
hasn't really made a difference to my laptop speed and there is a delay
between me typing and the text showing etc. Also if I want to select a
person's name to send an email to it takes an age to get the detail and
frequently changes who I select.

Also yesterday as an example my email settings changed without any input
from me. I have rectified this, this morning.

Is there any update on when my laptop will be upgraded as Jimmy said it was
up for renewal as it is quite old?

Just to mention a data breach. Jonny ( I think it was) came to school
yesterday to help our MSA staff get on to emails on phones.  I gave him the
list of logins and passwords and asked him to pass this back to me,
unfortunately he left it on the PC in the hall.
I have had to list it as a breach and I have asked all staff to change
passwords if they haven't from the original given when we moved to PMAT.

Hi ladies,
Could you please contact Vital and ask them to restore the following file for me? They've done it before so hopefully they can sort it again!

,T20231121.0014,Fwd: Domain whitelisting," Forwarded message ---------

Dear Jimmy,

My name is Shihaam. I am the Client Relations Manager at Purple Ruler. I've
been passed your contact details by your colleague, Liz Hardy, so we can
complete the IT set up for the National Tutoring Programme sessions we're
due to start 1 December 2023.

We need some domains whitelisting and to run a quick stress test to ensure
there are no network restrictions blocking students from accessing the
sessions and that the learning platform is functioning as it should be.

These are the domains that need whitelisting for the teaching platform:

   - Teachworks: https://purpleruler.teachworks.com/
   - www.teachworks.com
   - LessonSpace: https://www.thelessonspace.com / and room.sh
   - TCP, Port 443: 13.248.129.149 / ew2.static.room.sh
   - UDP, Port 443: 18.135.21.129 / turn.global.room.sh

These are the domains that need whitelisting for the testing system:

   1. Exam system is hosted behind Cloudflare, whose public IPs rarely
   change over time.

   2. Here is a list of IPs you should include at present:


   - Cloudflare for core web hosting: 172.66.40.166, 172.66.43.90
   - ClassMarker other services: 67.227.226.152, 67.227.137.66,
   72.52.179.37, 64.91.224.21


   1. URLS required:


   - *.classmarker.com
   - *.cmkr.co
   - *.purpleruler.com


   1. Port: Everything runs on port 443


Once that's done, we can run the stress test. All being well, this
shouldn't take longer than a couple of minutes. It's a case of joining me
on our learning platform, the Lessonspace, on the following link to check
it's working as it should be:
https://www.thelessonspace.com/space/074c9853-6163-441b-b732-138d1ee27e70

It needs to be accessed from a device with the same account permissions as
a student, as well as setup, such as camera, headset/mic.

Please can you book a stress test via our booking form below for a day/time
that suits you once the whitelisting is completed?
https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/Purplerulercom@theoverseasteacher.com/bookings/s/eg0C8KLTp0quRkwtPpmidw2


Thank you for your help.

Best wishes,
Shihaam

I also can't reboot it, as I don't have access to the Vhost server

Hello,

Please can someone look into the email problems that our governors are having.
Lucy Gilman is apparently still having problems - we have already raised a log for this.
Carol Ratcliffe is also now having problems and can not access her emails.

Please could you sort this immediately. If you can liaise directly with Carol and Lucy this should speed up the process.

To: Mrs Danks <c.danks@ebor.academy>


Good morning

I am unable to get onto my emails on both my home laptop and my mobile.
I was given a new password for my school laptop and once I had put my new
password in, it asked me to change it to my personal password.
The following day I tried to log onto my laptop at school but it would not
accept my new personal password and would only allow the new password given
from school.

At home it will not allow me to put any password in and just says I have
the wrong password.

My phone stopped letting me receive emails when I was given the new
password and will not accept any passwords. I have tried to use the
Authenticator but again this makes no difference.

Please help!

Caroline

I've just tried to call you this morning regarding your DBS, which has still not come through.

It has now reached 60 days, so I understand that it is possible for you to chase your DBS now.  Susan tells me that when you login, there will now be an active button you can click to chase the application.

Would you be able to do this?

Please let me know if you have any problems.

Hi Melanie.
Would it be possible to get the reader back to us along with one of the fobs you are trying to tap so we can do some testing?

If you are happy to do this, please send to:

ID Card Centre
Tech Support Dept
REF: HS 459685
53 Tenter Rd,
Moulton Park Industrial Estate,
Northampton
NN3 6AX

(Please make sure to use a tracked service in case of loss or damage).

We will test and if there is an issue replace the item and return your test fob.

If we find that the reader seems ok and if working on our test bench, we can go through the installation with you again.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks
Stephen

Hi Melanie,

If the old and new reader are doing the exact same thing (Lights green then going to red) then I wonder if the hardware is OK but there is an issue with the software or service.

Please can you do the following to restart the Paxton service to see if this helps:

Click Windows Start button
Type RUN, Enter
Type services.msc
Look for the Paxton Service in the window that opens
Check if this is running
(Take a screenshot at this point to send to me please).
Right click on the Paxton service and you will see a menu. Click START to start or restart the service.

Then test the reader using the Paxton software.

Thanks
Stephen

Hi Stephen

The original one works fine and then just stopped working I presume because we had had it awhile it was broken but then I got the new and that didn't work on registering fob's either. I had be able to just use the programme to add doors but that has stopped working too.

I have attached photos of bother the readers older one and the one we bought from yourselves they both have the same front. They both turn on and go green but then go red?

Hope this helps

Hi Melanie,
This is very strange. For a final check would you be able to email over a photo of the label on the reader please? Have you tried any other fob types on the reader if you have any?

I presume the old reader is broken and will not show us anything if you plug that one in?

Good morning,
I was hoping you would be able to investigate an issue I am having with the
'Paperless' system.
I last used it on Friday and all was well but today in addition to asking
me for my password, it is also asking me for a Security password which has
never been required before and I have never set up. I have checked with
colleagues and it does appear to just be me with this issue.
Any help you can give would be much appreciated.

many thanks

Subject: Civica Cashless Support - Planned Changes to Telephone based
support prodedures
To: dcalvert1@archbishopholgates.org <dcalvert1@archbishopholgates.org>


Hello,



I would like to introduce myself. My name is David Naylor, I have recently
taken over as the Cashless Support Team Manager.

I have been with Civica for 17 years and have been managing the Catering
(formerly Saffron) Support Team for the last 7 years.



Based on feedback we’ve received from customers, and following a review of
procedures, we are going to be changing the inbound phone support process
to improve the efficiency and response time of support.



To that end, we will be changing the way we handle incoming calls from
Friday 1st December 2023.



All incoming phone calls will be handled as an incident logging triage
service, and not a full end to end solution or problem fixing service.

The purpose of this is to reduce the amount of time each call takes, which
allows us to answer calls quicker and reduce the waiting time before
speaking to a handler.



This means during the incoming call the call handler will only be able to
do one of the following things.

·         Log a new incident and issue a support ticket reference.

·         Update the details of an existing ticket, this can include adding
a note that the ticket is being chased, or that the priority has changed.

·         Put a caller through to the Application Support Consultant who is
already handling the incident, and who has requested the customer to phone
in.



We appreciate that whilst this means no resolution will be provided in the
initial phone call, the amount of time you spend on hold will be reduced
significantly and we are expecting to see an improvement in our fault
resolutions times.



All incoming calls will be prioritised in line with your existing Service
Objectives, and will be assigned to an analyst, who will contact you to
progress the incident through to a resolution.



In addition to logging incidents via the phone, you will have the
opportunity to log an incident directly to the Civica Service Desk via the
online self-service portal. We’ll be working over the next few weeks to
ensure that login credentials are created and distributed, and further
communication regarding this will be sent before the 1st December date.



I hope that we can move forward and make continual improvements to the
service we offer. And I would welcome any feedback you wish to share with
me.

Hi All,

Hannah Wray (8Kx) said in a  meeting last week that she continues to
be missing School communications, i.e. about the school vaccines. Her
email address is correct on SIMS and she hasn't 'unsubscribed' as she gets
the newsletter and sparx comms? Can we help get to the bottom of this? I
believe she has tried to be in touch before but it still doesn't seem to be
right?!

Thanks,
Meg

Can someone assist? I have sent printing to the English office 4 times. It
says the toner needs replacing. I have turned it on and off (4 times) and
resent (4 times). It prints a couple of sheets and then stops. I have had
to give up.

I tend not to use the English office printer as it is too unreliable.
However, I had no choice today as I tried to collect printing from 'follow
me' (down in reception and on the heads of year corridor) - but they both
have a message that says 'no connection.'

I would be very grateful if someone could fix the printing issues.

Thanks a lot

Subject: Accessing photos through Windows

Hi

I'm working from home this afternoon and have discovered I can't access Photos on the U-drive through Teams. I get so far, then get a blank screen. I went onto RDS but discovered I can no longer access the U-drive this way.
But I did discover that the Admin (office) and Finance files can still be accessed via RDS.
Can I please have the same access to the U-Drive via RDS?

I need to be able to access all files via U-drive when working remotely, as I often do.

Thanks

Claire

Subject: Accessing photos through Windows

Hi

I'm working from home this afternoon and have discovered I can't access Photos on the U-drive through Teams. I get so far, then get a blank screen. I went onto RDS but discovered I can no longer access the U-drive this way.
But I did discover that the Admin (office) and Finance files can still be accessed via RDS.
Can I please have the same access to the U-Drive via RDS?

I need to be able to access all files via U-drive when working remotely, as I often do.

Thanks

Claire

Couple of things regarding the R&W software (sorry to keep asking about
it). I have a few accounts that are struggling to access and don't have a
full toolbar for some reason.

These are:
s.pidd1
j.patterson
r.duffil

Also, have you got any further with the student accounts being able to use
the speech to text function. The mics do work but don't seem to work with
the software on those accounts.

Thanks,

Sam

,T20231117.0101,Drawing facility? Pen-mouse?,"Hi both

Just a quick question - is there anything in school that can help me draw
diagrams / write freehand rather than trying to draw and write with a
mouse?

Almost like a pen version of a mouse; a pen-mouse?

When preparing lessons I normally do this by writing on the smartboard but
obviously I don't have this facility at the moment and I am finding it
difficult trying to write things accurately using a mouse when planning.

Just a thought!

We are having an issue with one of our printers. When you try and print
release something it comes up with the following message:

[image: image.png]
The 2 other printers seem to be working fine.

I have had a look at the connection and that all seems to be working as it
should. It does allow you to copy something but when scanning it will allow
it, however, won't appear in the place you have sent it.

I have obviously tried turning it on and off again with no luck.

Is there anything at your end that could possibly help sort this out or you
could suggest what to do?

Thanks,

Sam

Hi Russ,

Please see below with regards to the existing CCTV cameras in the YHS Annex.

Do you know if your contractor disconnected and reconnected the cameras in
the same way or got them back up and running?

Also, is everything completed with regards to the cab installation and
network in the building? I'm aware we're still waiting on the quotation to
renew the network points.

Thanks in advance and I look forward to hearing from you.



Kind regards

Good question; it's a bit beyond my area of expertise and not something
I've got experience with, as the system was already installed before we got
here and is maintained by a company called SecuriPlex, who the site team
(mostly Nigel) liaises with.

However,  what I would say is firstly *if *the person who disconnected it
took photos and/or made notes, then putting it all back *should *be easy
for Vital to do. Alternatively, if they didn't make any notes, then *if *the
system isn't fussy about which cables are plugged in where (which I don't
actually know), then the worst that would happen in that case would be that
the cameras would be different to what our spreadsheet says, in which case
that would be no problem as we would simply change our spreadsheet once
it's back up and running. On the other hand it *may *be that the cables
must be plugged in a certain way and it may be a challenge to do. Vital
*might* know the answer to this, or it may be a case of try it and see!

We *could *ask SecuriPlex for their view, and if it is complex, we could
ask them for a quote to do the work, but this may not be cheap so would be
best to avoid them having to do it, unless it's unavoidable; if you do want
us to contact SecuriPlex, my suggestion would be to go through Nigel if
possible as he already has contact with them and I've not contacted them
directly myself before.

Hope this helps,

I have a PowerPoint issue.

I have accidentally saved a new version of a PowerPoint over an old
version.  I didn't mean to do this and have essentially deleted the old
version which I need.

Is there any way to restore a previous saved version of a PowerPoint from a
previous day.

If you could let me know that would be great.

Thanks,

Adam

The voicemail email notifications have stopped working.

TVM onsite needs to be able to send email alerts to certain members of staff within the school.

I have been liaising with Gradwell (Our phone support people) we've looked at a few things already like the DNS configuration and checking ports are open.

Not sure where to go from here, I'm waiting to hear back from Gradwell with some suggestions on what to do pursue next.

One of my GCs have been archived and a new one set up (11C4). I can sort
this myself but I am wondering why this has happened? My class will not
have been able to do their homework as a result of this and I have only
noticed today when I was about to set the new homework. This also happened
to a Y10 class (10D1) earlier this year too. It seems quite random and I
was wondering if there is any logic to it?

Hi Sarah,

It is Leah and Bethany’s father Steve Adams.

We have spoken before. This is probably not your on your remit but as I
have not received and answer and I have your email I wondered if you could
help or forward on this email.

I emailed the school in the 29th of October to be asked to be put in the
parents distribution list and have a log on for Edulink as I missed Leah’s
parents evening as their mother did not give me the details.

It appears I have not received any response.

Regards,

Steve Adams.

Hi,

Jamie here from New Earswick.

Is it possible to add some apps to my ipad? They are on the Year 3 teacher's ipad to help a visually impaired lad in my class, but he is in Year 4 now, so I could do with them on mine.

The apps are:

  *   PrizmGo
  *   SnapType
  *   Seeing AI
  *   Dolphin Easy Reader
My ipad is IPAD1820

Thanks
Jamie

Good afternoon, 

 

I am Sarah O'Donnell from St Mary and St Joseph Primary school in Pocklington. You were our IT support last year until we changed our academy in September.

 

 Would you be able to tell us our username and password for the Ipads and icloud system as we cannot access the App store or add the ipads to the printers!

 

Many Thanks

You click launch meeting and nothing happens. We tried in edge and in chrome. Same issue.



Please can you fix this urgently. If this cannot be fixed can the zoom app be put on computers? We are only using the computer in Matyn's office on the common room for this.



This afternoon we made this work by getting the students to do so on their phone using the app where it worked fine.



This is the link - that a student is on until 15.30.

,T20231115.0201,Re: Disk error,"Hi Donna

I've had this too. So many PCs are left logged in which messes up Cubase and some saving options for the second person logged in. I'm forever restarting PCs due to GCSE students not signing out properly.

There's another thing with the new documents section that might be an issue but I need to test this more...

Thanks
Ian

Good morning Leanne,

That message is more like a warning instead of an error and since it was renewed already it will not stop working,

I checked together with Matthew last week and it's strange that it came back,

The email from yesterday got blocked for some reason but now they both came in.

I have included your IT again to look into this again and stop the message once and for all.

have this installed on my laptop for Friday, or is there a different app
you believe I should use?


I apologise for the short notice, but it has only been brought to my
attention in today's meeting.  Below is what I was sent in the chat during
the meeting.


There are a number of suitable clients available at no cost. A popular and
recognised choice is FileZilla. FileZilla can be downloaded from the

At Scarcroft Primary School, we wish to encourage staff to have a healthy
work-life balance, and therefore we discourage the sending of emails
outside of the traditional working day. Where emails are received after
6pm, over the weekend or during a holiday period, it is likely that a
response will be given during the school’s normal working hours. Thank you
in advance for your understanding in helping us to promote a happy, healthy

,T20231115.0057,RE: MFL printer - jobs not arriving,"Hi Alex,

Are these jobs that you've sent since it seemed to be fixed, or before?

From what I recall of the problem from last time, it's to do with the printer having some kind of 'identity crisis' - any jobs that were sent prior to the fix will probably just need to be sent again.

Fingers crossed...

,T20231115.0049,No internet in Head's office at Patrington,"Good Morning,

We have emailed a number of times about this now and still no-one has fixed
this issue.
Up until the powercut that tripped the router and left us without internet
for almost a week in October, I had no issue with accessing wifi from my
office.
Since the new router was installed and internet returned, I cannot access
internet in my office or the main office, but if I walk down the corridor a
bit the internet returns.
This to me means that one of the access points must now not be working.
Yesterday the exec team were in my office for the day and could not access
the internet.
At Patrington we only have 3 office spaces for use for private meetings as
the rest is classroom use. My office is one of those three spaces, but I
can't meet in here for online meetings or for live meetings where I need to
access online notes.
This is very disruptive to the smooth running of a school and I would
appreciate someone following this up to ensure this can be fixed without us
needing to chase this further.

Kind regards
Gill

It appears that, when Cobus reset the phones, they have either accidentally
or deliberately disabled some of the programmable features, i.e. DND Key,
Extension Name Change.

Can you ask them to rectify this and/or provide a list of the changed codes
provided please.  As this doesn't require access to the server, and I don't
believe it has any impact on the system, I think we should be allowed to
make these changes ourselves.

We have 1 computer, the last one at the end of the building that doesn't
recognise the domain. It was okay up to mid morning when the chrome books
were not working but when everything else was resolved that seemed to stop
working. It is the class computer and is needed urgently for teaching.
Apparently it was reported yesterday.

Apologies to keep bothering you with this.

Just to update you with the read and write software, staff seem to be able
to login and access the whole of the software without any problems.

Some of the students who try to use it are still unable to use the speech
to text feature when they try to speak into a mic that is connected to a
PC.

However staff do not seem to have this issue, is there a setting in the
student accounts that needs to be enabled at your end to allow this to work?

Thanks,

Sam

Good morning,

My daughter Poppie-Blossom Darnell in form 7e is currently not in school.

Poppie is struggling again to come into school again, I do believe this is
related to her anxiety around school and her academic and Sen issues, I
have a meeting next Monday with the trust senco that has been coming in
that hopefully will help us to resolve this reluctance continuing.

With Poppie-Blossom not been at school we have tried to access her Google
classroom for something for her to do at home but have been unable to do
so, is there any chance I could have the correct log in for her account or
this could be looked at,as it could just be that she is struggling to log
in because of her sen issues.

Thank you

Cassie Smith

had the new ones put it even though they are quicker they are still
crashing everyday. When this happens over lunch all the names have to be
put through the working till inbetween service and it takes time which
leaves us short in the kitchen. Then children are aware when this happens
which leads them to over spending at lunch which leads them to getting into
debt. Is there anything we can do to sort this out

Just wondering on the off chance, if you have borrowed the LRC's
projector's remote control for an exam room?
If not, is it possible to order another one? The LRC's remote control after
over 7 years has gone AWOL. It was there on Friday P5 and left on the
Teacher's desk but I arrived Monday morning and it had gone and the tables
in the LRC had been changed.

Best wishes,

Monica

,T20231114.0139,Bitlocker Recovery Issues,"Hi there,

Following the last wave of windows updates, we've had computers begin to
fail their task sequence during OS Deployment during enabling bitlocker,
the error code we get is 0x80310048 initially this was a small issue that
stopped the encryption of some newly formatted machines, I restored to
manually enabling bitlocker, this however continued to happen, so I enabled
some group policies with a script to automatically turn bitlocker on, if it
wasn't all ready, in the hopes that this would trigger bitlocker to enable
if for whatever reason it didn't.

Since then we've begun to see some devices start popping up with bitlocker
recovery, every boot without fail. As far as I can tell they're all in
regards to the requirements for bitlocker (TPM on etc etc). I started
looking more closely at these devices but haven't had any success
consistently getting them to work going forwards.

Today this has begun to occur on more and more computers, prompting me to
turn off the group policies I've set as a caution (I don't believe this
would cause an issue). I noticed within the last hour that our BIOS Version
was approximately 2 years out of date on our affected computers (this seems
to apply to a lot of them). We have since tried updating the BIOS version
but this doesn't look to fix the issue.

Have you heard of anything like this before or have any ideas on what to
try, both me and Laurence are stumped.

Thanks,

Hi all,

I hope you are well. I'm conscious that I have had a few different conversations with you this week, so please disregard anything we have already discussed form the following email. I just wanted to bring everything together for next week:

In advance of Wednesday, please could I ask that you have added any PP presentations that you are planning to use to this master PP: [https://res-h3.public.cdn.office.net/assets/mail/file-icon/png/pptx_16x16.png] Y8 Careers Day Master PP (3).pptx<https://huntingtonschool-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/s_daniel_huntington-ed_org_uk/EfaeKPWgMVBKm_o4EkJVqEMBVtqtako5FiONOKNypqWbWA?e=J4MwKY>

Please could you also add in your 3 'Take Aways' onto the slide provided, if you haven't already

Please note the other version of the PP (sent previously) will no longer work. Please use the one above - all information added to the last one has been moved over.

Remember the sessions on Wednesday will be very short. By the time the students have arrived, and with a few minutes at the end for them to note down their take-aways and complete feedback, you will probably only have 20-25 minutes with them so don't feel you have lots of time to fill.

On Wednesday, please can you arrive from 9am, and by no later than 9.30am. Due to DBS and safeguarding issues, it will take a little while to get you all in place (and more importantly with a coffee in hand) so please just bear with us.

When you arrive, please come to main school recpetion and we will collect you from there.

There will be 10 car parking spaces reserved for you at the front of school (turn right as you come in), but there is also parking around the side of school (left as you come in) and across the road. Bicycle parking is avaialble in front of school.

As a reminder, you will have 8 x 30 minute sessions throughout the day, borken up by breaks and lunch. Lunch will be provided in the staffroom and includes vegetarian options.

You will have teachers in all of your sessions, and they will deal with any poor behaviour. However if you spot something that they don't see (behaviour or any other concern), please do let the teacher in the room know.

If you have any questions, please let me know. Otherwise, I look forward to seeing you all on Wednesday.

Shane

Hi Liz,

I don't know if you are the right person to email but a wire is broken and
has come out of the IWB in the Pufferfish classroom just now. The IWB is
still working as far as I can tell. But just wanted to report it for safety
reasons. The screen looks a bit pink. I have tucked the wire in so it
should be safe.

Hi Shane.

I’m just building my powerpoint slides.

Inserting a video from an online source (Vimeo) - I’m getting an error message.

Is there a restriction on Vimeo and, if so, how do we work around it please?

Cheers,

Ben.

Hi all,

I hope you are well. I'm conscious that I have had a few different conversations with you this week, so please disregard anything we have already discussed form the following email. I just wanted to bring everything together for next week:

In advance of Wednesday, please could I ask that you have added any PP presentations that you are planning to use to this master PP: [https://res-h3.public.cdn.office.net/assets/mail/file-icon/png/pptx_16x16.png] Y8 Careers Day Master PP (3).pptx<https://huntingtonschool-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/s_daniel_huntington-ed_org_uk/EfaeKPWgMVBKm_o4EkJVqEMBVtqtako5FiONOKNypqWbWA?e=J4MwKY>

Please could you also add in your 3 'Take Aways' onto the slide provided, if you haven't already

Please note the other version of the PP (sent previously) will no longer work. Please use the one above - all information added to the last one has been moved over.

Remember the sessions on Wednesday will be very short. By the time the students have arrived, and with a few minutes at the end for them to note down their take-aways and complete feedback, you will probably only have 20-25 minutes with them so don't feel you have lots of time to fill.

On Wednesday, please can you arrive from 9am, and by no later than 9.30am. Due to DBS and safeguarding issues, it will take a little while to get you all in place (and more importantly with a coffee in hand) so please just bear with us.

When you arrive, please come to main school recpetion and we will collect you from there.

There will be 10 car parking spaces reserved for you at the front of school (turn right as you come in), but there is also parking around the side of school (left as you come in) and across the road. Bicycle parking is avaialble in front of school.

As a reminder, you will have 8 x 30 minute sessions throughout the day, borken up by breaks and lunch. Lunch will be provided in the staffroom and includes vegetarian options.

You will have teachers in all of your sessions, and they will deal with any poor behaviour. However if you spot something that they don't see (behaviour or any other concern), please do let the teacher in the room know.

If you have any questions, please let me know. Otherwise, I look forward to seeing you all on Wednesday.

Shane

Hello Karen,



Thank you for your email.

Your database is hosted on our cloud server, so there shouldn't be any
issues with moving this to a new PC. To do so, simply reinstall the
software using the attached installation instructions, which also include
links to the latest Installer and the recommended version of Java. I've
also attached the AIS_cfg.properties file, which is needed to finish the
setup.

Please let me know if you need anything else.



Kind Regards,
Timo

Good morning,

Our library computer is being upgraded today and we are therefore going to
need to set up the Accessit software on the new PC.

Our IT guy has asked me to contact you to see if this is something that you
can help him with as he is unsure how this was done in the past?

He said that anytime after 10:30 today would be convenient but it depends
on availability your end.

Kind regards

,T20231114.0096,RE: Queries,"Hi Helen

Not a problem.

For attaching docs to an email, the ""attach copy"" should work. The share link is the same principle as sharing a Google Doc you need to add the recipient to the doc sharing settings. I will ask Mateusz to have a look when he comes into school.

Saving a doc, you can either save to your Google Drive or My Docs. My docs is OneDrive. To make it easier to save to Google Drive if you log into Google Drive for Desktop it will create a ""Drive Share"" to save too so you don't have to login to the browser every time.

Mateusz asked me about the PC for Jo, and he is going to pop back in today I believe and have a chat with you. The original plan was to Flex the original admin PC and put it in the library which I believe you have now turned into a classroom? He is going to swap the PC so Jo will have a Windows device.

Subject: Queries

HI Adam

Just a few queries about the new system. As you know, I have pretty much zero IT knowledge, so am just a bit baffled about things!!


  *   The new desktops - I am confused about the Office suite. When I attach a word document to an email that I have saved on the desktop, it gives me the option to 'attach a copy' or 'share link'. If I do attach a copy, it says 'download failed' and the person at the other end can't open it easily as before. I have attached one for you to see.



  *   If I do create a doc using Microsoft Office - do I have to save it to Google Drive or can it go in My Docs. If I put it in MY Docs, is it going to the cloud? Is this the One Drive bit?



  *   Jo Fineran's desktop is working as a Chromebook, when everybody else has a Windows login. Mattheius came out yesterday to look at this and there was some confusion as, when he left, I presumed he'd changed it so it worked the same as everyone else's when I asked if all was ok (I was in the middle of a meeting so couldn't chat), Jo was confused as M said I wanted it working as a Chromebook. Therefore Jo has it still as a Chromebook and is getting really frustrated as she can't use it as she needs to.


I think overall, what I am saying is, we are all a bit confused as to how the new system works! Can you send me some sort of 'idiot's guide' so I understand and can pass onto staff. And please can Mattheius sort Jo's desktop as she nis not a happy bunny.

Thanks Adam, and sorry for being a clueless pain!

confirmed as of the morning of Wednesday 22nd November. I know that you
intend to install a new suite of computers on Friday 24th November. We are
receiving training in the afternoon.

However it would be good if one of the new machines was ready for the laser
cutter by Wednesday 22nd, so that you are not having to reinstall the
software and test the hardware 2 days later. Also it would avoid changing
any parameters that have been installed on the Wednesday.

,T20231114.0024,Projector,"Hi all,

I have been having issues with my projector since last half term (it has
been making an extremely loud buzzing sound) and was informed that it'd get
looked at over the half term holidays. I am unsure whether or not this
happened but it still often makes loud noises and last thursday I was
unable to freeze/turn off my projector at all. I think it probably needs
replacing as we have tried new batteries in the remote/ new remotes and
that doesn't solve the issue.

If this could be seen to asap it would be greatly appreciated. I am having
to do registers and other confidential tasks on my phone currently as I am
unable to freeze my board. My phone is very slow and it's making lots of
tasks extremely difficult.

Thanks,
Maddie

Subject: Action recommended: Review a new Conditional Access policy when it’s created in your tenant

We’ll create the policy on or after 09 November 2023.
[Microsoft Security]
We'll create a new Conditional Access policy in your tenant on or after 09 November 2023

You’re receiving this email because you’re a global administrator for Woodlesford Primary School.

In 2020, we introduced security defaults in Microsoft Entra ID, which significantly raised baseline security for organisations. Now, to build on those improvements, we’re introducing Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies. Between 09 November 2023, and December 31, 2023, we’ll create a new Conditional Access policy in your Woodlesford Primary School tenant.

This policy, Multifactor authentication for admins accessing Microsoft Admin Portals<https://emails.azure.microsoft.com/redirect/?destination=https%3A%2F%2Faka.ms%2FMMAdminMFA-email&p=bT0zMjdiMmVjMi1lZTJjLTQ4M2ItYjk1ZS02ODQ5MzIzZTViM2UmdT1hZW8mbD1NTUFkbWluTUZBLWVtYWls>, will be created in report-only mode<https://emails.azure.microsoft.com/redirect/?destination=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fconditional-access%2Fconcept-conditional-access-report-only&p=bT0zMjdiMmVjMi1lZTJjLTQ4M2ItYjk1ZS02ODQ5MzIzZTViM2UmdT1hZW8mbD1jb25jZXB0LWNvbmRpdGlvbmFsLWFjY2Vzcy1yZXBvcnQtb25seQ%3D%3D>. This means that it won’t block any access, but it will generate reports on how it will affect users when it’s switched to the On state.

After the policy has been created in your tenant, you’ll have 90 days to evaluate and configure it. Then, if you haven’t already moved it to the On or Off state, it’ll be automatically moved to On. Once the policy is enabled, users covered by it will need to have multifactor authentication.

Recommended action

To avoid any potential disruption to users’ access and to ensure this policy meets your organisation’s needs, take the following actions within 90 days of its creation, before it’s moved to the On state:

  *   Review the effects and benefits<https://emails.azure.microsoft.com/redirect/?destination=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fconditional-access%2Fconcept-conditional-access-report-only&p=bT0zMjdiMmVjMi1lZTJjLTQ4M2ItYjk1ZS02ODQ5MzIzZTViM2UmdT1hZW8mbD1jb25jZXB0LWNvbmRpdGlvbmFsLWFjY2Vzcy1yZXBvcnQtb25seV8y> of the new policy. If you don’t want us to enable it automatically, set it to Off. Or, you may set it to On at any time.
  *   Customise this policy according to your specific needs, such as excluding emergency access accounts<https://emails.azure.microsoft.com/redirect/?destination=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fconditional-access%2Fconcept-conditional-access-users-groups%3FWT.mc_id%3DPortal-Microsoft_AAD_IAM%23exclude-users&p=bT0zMjdiMmVjMi1lZTJjLTQ4M2ItYjk1ZS02ODQ5MzIzZTViM2UmdT1hZW8mbD1jb25jZXB0LWNvbmRpdGlvbmFsLWFjY2Vzcy11c2Vycy1ncm91cHM%3D>.
  *   Verify that all users covered by this policy have enabled and registered at least one multifactor authentication method. If necessary, run a registration campaign<https://emails.azure.microsoft.com/redirect/?destination=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fauthentication%2Fhow-to-mfa-registration-campaign&p=bT0zMjdiMmVjMi1lZTJjLTQ4M2ItYjk1ZS02ODQ5MzIzZTViM2UmdT1hZW8mbD1ob3ctdG8tbWZhLXJlZ2lzdHJhdGlvbi1jYW1wYWlnbg%3D%3D> to set up the Authenticator app.

I continue to be unable to access SIMS, now I cannot access it on the remote server either (not sure if this is because a password reset was sent...)  At school it gives Reason 0.

Please help as I cannot input Year 9 grades (due Thursday - I work Tues and Thurs officially) or Year 11 but can do those with TJB as shared class.

I feel very disappointed that I cannot meet the deadline.  I did try to sort this in September, but I know I didn't contact all the people in this email.

I am still getting the second message today. (I did reply to the email
yesterday but it sent me an automated reply saying I'd sent too many
messages!)

I currently can't produce reports etc and audit records for schools as I
can't use Excel or Word (I do use other products in the Office Suite, but
these are the main two).

SO:

   - Product activation keys need sorting out
   - Connecting to networks when I visit schools needs sorting (so I don't
   have to use my phone as a hotspot)
   - Password manager required (or I'll just have to carry them all around
   written down - which is LESS SAFE!!!)
   - Also - please stop it switching off when I put it into sleep mode or
   lock screen.

I just want my laptop to function correctly to enable me to do my job
efficiently.  For any over-rides/authorisations, please speak to Andy
Roberts.

Parents evening tomorrow, I would like a clock projecting onto the screen in the main hall and wall in the dining hall. I can do this, however, how can you stop the screen from going to sleep and turning off? I would require a laptop in the dining hall. If this could be done tomorrow afternoon before 3pm that would be really helpful.

Thanks

Tom

Donna Stockill and Liz Dunbar are both struggling to access SIMS both in school and at home.
I think both have emailed you about it?
Also SIMS doesn't seem to be on all the machines (especially the office one) in Music.
We've got data deadlines looming, so would you be able to try and sort asap.

Also I'm not in a position yet to see student work that has been saved in their document folders as discussed last week.
Could you update me on where we're at with that?

Hi everyone,

We have a new pupil starting on Wednesday. Her name is Antonidaishe
Matambanadzo but she would like to be know as Nicole.

She will go into 7MP and we will buddy her with Beatrix Box.

Groups wise, she is in Foundation 1 and Stem 2, with her PE being PE2.

I have met her and she speaks very good English. She loves reading and
doing sport, particularly cricket.

I have requested an academic report from her school back in Zimbabwe and
will share as and when that comes to me.

Thank you

At Scarcroft Primary School, we wish to encourage staff to have a healthy
work-life balance, and therefore we discourage the sending of emails
outside of the traditional working day. Where emails are received after
6pm, over the weekend or during a holiday period, it is likely that a
response will be given during the school’s normal working hours. Thank you
in advance for your understanding in helping us to promote a happy, healthy

Capita just had a remote session with me (as I believe I think they thought
I was just stupid).
They have now sent the instructions below. Ignore the first bit, as we did
the top bit together.

Lots of waffle, but basically we need to import the two patches, in the
correct order.
[image: image.png]
I've downloaded and extracted them. They are here:
S:\SIMS\Sims Patches

Could you import them at some convenient point please?
I believe we all need to exit SIMS, in order to do this?

Good Afternoon Vanessa,

Thank you for raising this case regarding System Manager - Log in details.
Please see the below KB article which relates to this issue:
Error messages when editing login credentials in System Manager: ""Do not
have permission""
KB0024182

Error messages when editing login credentials in System Manager: ""Do not
have permission""
29-L6K8G0
Notes

When editing login details in System Manager, one of the following errors
occur when the Save button is clicked:

*""Critical Cannot drop the schema 'SIMS_[Username]', because it does not
exist or you do not have permission.""*

* ""SIMS_[Username] is not a valid login or you do not have permission.""*

*""Unable to save: Warning: Unable to add a role membership ([value]) User
or role ""[user]"" does not exist in this database.""*

*""Unable to save: The EXECUTE permission was denied on the object
'dp_p_user_password_reset', database 'sims', schema 'sims'.""*

*""Unable to save : 41:4[DB_pit_user_user/3]:invalid value'(null)'for
parameter at password generated supplied to procedure [DB_pit_user_user/3""*
Workaround

For sites who host their SIMS database locally, to resolve this issue
please carry out all of the following steps:

*1.* In *Focus | System Manager | Manage Users* select the affected user.
Untick the 'Active' check box and save. Then, close SIMS.net. Log back into
SIMS.net and go back to *Focus | System Manager | Manage Users* and select
the affected user. Tick the 'Active' check box and amend the details. These
should now save. If this does not save and you receive the error 'The
EXECUTE permission was denied on the object 'db_pix_droplogin', database
'sims', schema 'sims' please refer to KB0023161
<https://parentpaygroup.service-now.com/csm?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0023161>
for
further guidance.

*2.* If the above does not resolve the issue, then please contact your
Local Support Unit and request Patches 19098 and 20249. These will grant
execute permissions to all SIMS objects. As these Patches are a database
install procedure and will grant execute permissions to all SIMS objects,
they *must* be applied using the SQL System Administrator credentials when
all users are logged out of SIMS.net.

Patch 19098 will need to be applied first, and Patch 20249 will need to be
applied second. Extract the zip files and apply the Patches against the
SIMS database. With all Patches, it is important to apply these at a quiet
time and once a backup has been taken of the SIMS database.

*3.* If the Patches do not resolve the issue, then you will need to
reattach the SIMS database. Log into dBattach and detach the SIMS database.
Cut the SIMS MDF and SIMS LDF out of the SQL DATA folder (e.g. C:\Program
Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL12.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA) to the server
desktop.
Log back into dBattach and attach the cut SIMS MDF.

*For Hosted SIMS/SIMS Connected customers, please raise a case with your
local support unit detailing the error message received.*

How to run a patch through DBupgrade
KB0024145

How to run a patch through DBupgrade
66-B5Q2F0
Notes

How to apply a patch using DBupgrade.exe.
Workaround

1. Extract all of the patch files from the file you were sent *(onto your
Desktop, for example).*

For example, if you were sent or have ""Patch 22573.zip"", please extract
this to produce three more files. This includes:

3.61.870 to 3.62.999 22573 Patch.XML
3.61.870 to 3.62.999 22573 Patch.ZIP
3.61.870 to 3.62.999 22573 Patch.ZIP.signature

*Please do not extract the contents of the second .zip file within the
initial .zip file that you were sent.*

2. Run dbUpgrade. This is located in either:

Start > All Programs > SIMS Applications > dbUpgrade
*or:*
C:\Program Files\SIMS\SIMS .net\DBupgrade.exe (*on workstation*)
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\Binn\DBupgrade.exe (*on
SIMS SQL server*)

3. Select '*Run the following SIMS database upgrade file*' and specify the
path to the location of where the patch file (.zip) is.

Using the earlier example, you would point this where the 3.61.870 to
3.62.999 22573 Patch.ZIP file is.

4. Enter the SIMS connection and login details:

- For the '*Server Name*' field, please enter the SIMS Server name and the
SQL Instance the database is hosted on, e.g. *MyServer\SIMS20XX*.
- Enter the name of your SIMS .net database into the '*Database Name*'
field.
- And then login with a SIMS username and password or you can use the SQL
SA user account.


If you are unsure of your server or database name details you can find
these via the menu route Tools | System Information within SIMS for SIMS,
or via the FMSConnect.ini located in C:\Program Files\SIMS\FMSSQL (or
C:\Program Files (x86)\SIMS\FMSSQL depending on your setup) for FMS.

Click '*Login*' once these details have been entered.

*Important Note:** If advised to run the patch as the SA user please
specify SA as the SIMS Username and enter your SA password.*

5. The patch should now show in the list, which then if you click install,
this will apply the patch against the specified database.

Depending on what is being applied, this can take some time to complete and
the dbUpgrade window may become unresponsive during this time. It would be
strongly recommended that this window is left open until it has finished.

*Important Note: It would be advised to apply patches or upgrades at a time
when no SIMS users are logged in.*

I hope this helps.

Kind Regards,

*Sam Skinner*

I'm so sorry to bother you, but have a specific request...

Last half term our Business Partner Bryony left (b.chambers@ebor.academy).
Vanessa Botterill has taken over but unfortunately doesn't have access to
many of the files on the shared drive that we need.

I'm specifically wanting results of google forms that Bryony set up for us.

Vital have said they are able to retrieve them and give Ness access but
they need your acknowledgement that this is okay.

Can you possibly 'reply all' or speak to Vital directly if this is okay.
Happy to discuss further if needed.

Thanks in advance,
Natalie

,T20231113.0158,ipad,"Hello.

I have a pupil in my year 9 class who borrows an ipad from school. When I
set his reading plus homework today, he asked if he could take his borrowed
ipad home. I said no - but then he said that he had taken it home
previously, when he 'had been given permission by IT.' I advised him that I
could not give him permission, but if he again spoke to IT they would be
able to advise him. He said he did not have a device at home that he could
use for the reading plus homework.

Ben - is this correct - has IT previously given pupils permission to take
home an ipad?

Thanks

Good afternoon


We’ve been made aware that a recent update from Google has included some
restrictions for 3rd Party Apps for Education.


*What does this mean for us?*


As Google rolls this update out* it is highly likely that students will
become blocked from being able to log in to Sparx Maths or Sparx Reader
using Google SSO. This has already happened to some of our users who have
reported seeing an ‘Access Denied’ message.


*We have not been given a timescale for these updates by Google.


*How can we fix this?*


If you have Student SSO set up (or are planning to set this up soon) follow
the steps in this Google article
<https://sparx.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ac5ef746d29187afc4e50557&id=98b8e64d06&e=dcf9a9e8b9>to
set the Sparx app to be ‘*Trusted*’ and ‘*Allow for exemption from API
access blocks in context-aware access.*’


We’ve sent this email to the Head of Maths, Head of English and your
Network Manager to make sure you are all aware and are able to action this
as soon as possible and allow your students to log in using SSO.


Kind Regards

-------------------------------------

Hi Clare,

Thank you for confirming. Unfortunately, as we are unable to replicate this issue (I am able to log in successfully at your school's unique url using the default password for both of these users) we need to investigate whether there is a local issue which is preventing Holly and Claire from being able to log in successfully.

Do you have any remote software such as Ultraviewer, Quick Assist or Anydesk installed so that we can remote on to your school computer and test logging in as these users?

Please could you also let me know if you are happy for me to create a test staff member on your school site so that you are able to test logging in as this test user?

Many thanks

Hi Clare,

Thanks for getting in touch.

I have completed some testing on this and I have been able to log in as Holly and Claire on your school's Libresoft site using the default password format.

Please could I check that these members of staff are attempting to log in at your school's unique login page url? https://library.libresoft.co.uk/3832314-lb5ypfyp7wvnwr0rwqtv-wps/

and that they are following the below format for their default passwords -

School site id (1713) + s + first two letters of first name (Upper then lowercase) + first two letters of last name (Upper then lower case) + Password number (found on staff details screen).

Please let me know and I shall continue to investigate this for you.

Many thanks

There are a lot of the laptops in the exams trolley that weren't converted
to Trelson laptops. I've had to get the kids in there to do it on a Google
doc and send to teachers.

Could you have a look? It's pretty much all of them that are out in P2, P6
and the sports hall.

an issue in S17.

My laptop was replaced last week and all was working fine at school, but at
home I was unable to access any old files or the school shared area which
made it hard for me to get tasks completed, I didn't have this issue with
my old laptop and wondered if it was a quick fix?
Also, I use smart notebook for all my lesson slides and I'm unable to
download it to my new laptop, when I try the message below shows. Any help
with that would be much appreciated.
Many thanks,
Aimee

The computer in B9 has turned itself on during a lesson
The computer in B8 has also done this twice today.

It appears to go black. Not sure if it is a hardware issue. The only way to
appear to get it to do anything when it does this is to turn it off on the
harddrive, leave it a minute and then restart the computer.

Please can these be looked at as soon as possible.

,T20231110.0157,Re: Governor email problem,"Hi there,

Vital responded to my request to support Will and shared that they had
changed the password. Unfortunately Will had managed to access his account
in Governors in the end so hadn't needed any support. I had asked Helen to
ring Will to explain his password had changed and to share what it was
however she must have not seen this when I found this out yesterday
afternoon.

Vital are you able to help as this needs sorting again.

Thank you,

Caroline

Hi Hannah

As discussed, I have contact Vital York to advise on the current issue with syncing Teachers2Parents with SIMS.

As we're unable to resolve this issue, Vital are going to liaise with yourselves and Teachers2Parents to get the sync software installed on the the SIMS Remote Desktop so that you can get the accurate data on the system.

If you need any support from myself in regards to SIMS login details for the sync, please let me know.

Many Thanks,

the exams next week!

Please find attached the exam paper for Monday morning which needs to be
available via the Read and Write Software for students who require a reader.

Please note: Tilly J-G opted last time for 50% extra time rather than the
computer reader - I don't know if any other students have requested the
same.

Please would it be possible for someone to take a look at the IWB within
our classroom? At the moment we can use it to mirror our desktop screen but
that is all.

We would really like to be able to use the board interactively - using the
pens on it and so on. It would support a lot of teaching,
especially phonics to have it working fully.

Thanks

Riviam is the new provider of childhood immunisations. I need to be able to
access their portal to see which students have consented for the flu jab
but when I go into it it comes up as forbidden. I have called Riviam and
they say it will be a problem with our firewall.
Can anyone look into it today for me? They have said that 654 students have
consent so far and they all need allocating a time!

We need to find a laptop or chromebook that a student can take home
with them and use for their independent study.  Ideally we need something
organised by the middle of next week.  Do we have a device 'kicking around'
that can be set up for usage at home? This is a loan.

This is for Isobel Chambers - Year 7.

I have spoken to mum this morning and have told her we WILL make this
happen!

Could you please install the HUe software on the computers in English,
starting with B3, B1, B4 and B7.  I really need it to turn on
automatically when the visualiser is plugged in. I know I can access it
through the website, but this takes time and is faffy when you are
switching between PPT and the actual visualiser.

Thanks

,T20231110.0014,Student access to videos,"Good morning,

George Pindar School are having issues with students accessing videos for
corbett maths on youtube. This is also happening when accessing embedded
videos (I think these also come from you tube) on mathswatch.co.uk.

I am assuming this is related to the move over to the new Smoothwall
solution at the school and so should be a relatively straight forward fix.
Could this possibly be looked at as a matter of urgency as students are
unable to access these resources as part of their lessons.

The principal has tried authorising Corbett videos on Youtube which doesn't
seem to have resolved the issue.

Staff have access to all videos without any issue.

Please let me know if I can do anything to assist with troubleshooting this
issue

I have used my log in details (username and password) to log in from home
and that works fine but I haven't been able to log in at Poppleton Road
Primary School on a whiteboard, computer or laptop.  I updated my password
when last directed to and this is working fine on my home laptop but not on
anything that I have tried at school, please could you advise on what to do
next.

Also, I use the whiteboards without a laptop connected to them but I am
unable to print from them, is this possible to change?

Many thanks,

,T20231109.0214,Problems with MS Paint,"Hi,

MS Paint works for most users, but some accounts are unable to open it. Hard to think of a reason why, but if one of the affected children is logged on, it won't open; if I log onto the same laptop, I can use it fine. When we search for the app, it appears, but there is no logo just a white rectangle, and clicking on the rectangle (or right clicking and selecting 'open') achieves nothing.

I don't have an exhaustive list of affected accounts, but they include:


  *   Kitty Machine (Year 4)
  *   Willa Bensalim (Year 4)
  *
Margot Wood (Year 4)
  *   Camilla Hogg (Year 5)

Any suggestions?

,T20231109.0211,RWPA broken speaker,"Hi,
I wondered if you could help? My speaker connection has stopped working at
Robert Wilkinson Primary Academy in the music room. Sound comes out of the
computer but when I plug the cable in to connect it to the classroom
speakers, no sound comes out. I have had several teachers look at it and
they can't figure it out. It should have lights to say it is on at the wall
but there are no lights.
Thanks so much,
Emily

Subject: York Peace Vigil at York Minster, 11th November, 6:30pm (Case Ref:
ZA68209)
To: <siobhan.callaghan@parliament.uk>



Good morning,

I am writing today to share details of an upcoming event in York that may
be of interest to you, your colleagues, and your students.

Right now, I know many people across York are distressed about the
horrendous situation in Israel/Gaza. We continue to hear news that
situation has worsened, and we see that there are more casualties and
deaths in this war. The humanitarian support is completely insufficient to
meet need, hostages are still missing, and the bombing of innocent
civilians has taken the death toll to more than 10,000.

We can often feel so helpless when we see these things; however, there is
something really practical you and your students can do to help, if you
would like to.

On *Saturday 11 November at 6.30pm*, I have called for a *Peace Vigil* to
be held at *York Minster*. This is an event for the whole of York, *children
and adults*, to come and see our city’s faith, political and civic
leaders *standing
together calling for peace*.

At this event, we will be creating a dove of peace on the raised altar
platform of the Minster, made from pieces of paper with your hopes,
petitions, prayers and pleas for the Middle East. Following the vigil, I
will be gathering up all of these words and then presenting them to the UN
Secretary General, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition.
There will also be an opportunity to hear some words, to light a candle and
to reflect on the current situation.

This unique event will show that our city of York, as *England’s only Human
Rights City*, is united in our call for a peace process to commence and the
fighting to stop.

As I appreciate it may be difficult for some to attend this event at such
short notice, I also wanted to provide the opportunity for our children and
young people in York to share their voices. If you would be happy to
provide opportunity for students to put down their own thoughts, hopes,
petitions, prayers, or drawings on pieces of white paper, I would be hugely
grateful. For those children who may not provide a written contribution, we
would welcome drawings too - perhaps a picture of a dove, handprints or
other symbols of peace – anything they would like to share.

My office can of course arrange collection of these prior to the event and
ensure these are added to the dove of peace, and shared with the UN
Secretary General, Prime Minister, and Leader of the Opposition.

*Do let me know if you are able to facilitate this for your students, and
if you would like my office to collect these contributions in order for
them to be taken to taken to the vigil.*

I hope you can pass on the details of this event to your staff and students
too, and I look forward to seeing those who can attend this important
event. For those who cannot, I look forward to adding their messages to the
dove of peace, as the unity we show will model what can be achieved in the
name of peace.

Yours sincerely,
Rachael

It has been agreed that I will have sole access to hello@ going forward.
Can I please therefore request that the staff who currently have the inbox
delegated (other than myself), have this removed when possible?
I believe that discussions still need to take place with regards to the
setting up of an attendance email for parents, but Glen is dealing with
this.

Thank you

Good morning Toni



Just to confirm, our data comms colleagues ran tests on your circuit speed and the following image shows the speeds your school is receiving.  This suggests an internal network issue.



[cid:image012.png@01DA12E4.AF4418D0]



The above image shows the Smoothwall downloaded a 1Gb file at around 701Mb/sec, my Data comms colleagues tell me, from our point of view, up to our demarcation point, the circuit and Smoothwall are functioning correctly.



Regarding your Chromebook query, if your IT support provider can provide further details, we will of course look in to this for you, but our previous reports after the Teams meeting in October showed the fault had been resolved and pupils where showing they could log on and Smoothwall could identify them.



Running some reports for yesterday’s usage, you can see users logged in to Chromebooks and Smoothwall identifying the users.



[cid:image001.png@01DA12E6.073DA730]





We can see some pupils are already logging in to their Chromebooks this morning, which shows they are being identified correctly:



[cid:image003.png@01DA12E8.A08D0500]

Hi Sue



There is a separate internet issue, very slow and not very strong connection in certain arears of the school, I have mentioned this before.  And alsoI don't think the Chromebook issue has been resolved either?  I was at the meeting and it wasn't sorted out then and nobody came back to me?

Subject: RE: Internet Issues - Hilderthorpe Primary



Hi Toni



I am sorry you are still having issues.



We were under the impression the chrome book issues you were experiencing was resolved when Paul and Sean met with your IT support provider via their Team meeting  19th October.



[cid:image022.png@01DA12E4.AF4418D0]



Regarding the internet issues, we are not aware of any external issues with the internet supply.  When you say the whole school are seeing performance issues, is this whilst using the Wi-Fi or when the devices are plugged in to the ethernet?  Have your ICT support provider done their internal checks such as checking the Wi-Fi, switches etc?



I had asked the team to do some investigations following your earlier email, and they could see traffic growing through as expected on 25 October.



[cid:image023.png@01DA12E4.AF4418D0]





What would be useful is for you to take regular speed checks throughout the day over a week or so to see if there is a pattern of performance drops as these may correspond with either Wi-Fi demand or if there are any automated IT processes occurring, which may be impacting on the usage.  I will ask the Data comms team to carry out back office checks too.



Due to work commitments, we don’t have an engineer available to visit your site to check the Filter server, ASA until next week.



I will log a call in the meantime, if you can ask your IT providers to check the internal network in the first instance and take a log of performance drops across your site, the Data comms team will be able to check logs and carry out further investigations.





Kindest regards

,T20231109.0057,Y3 Screen to PC issue,"Hi,

This morning, the Y3 PC for some reason does not work when connected to the
interactive screen

If you unplug the screen from the PC, or switch the screen off, the PC
monitor works. If the screen is switched on, and connected to the PC, the
monitor states that it is not connected to the PC and enters sleep mode.

Please could you advise?  We've switched the PC off, checked all of the
wires and that's when we found that the PC monitor works when the main
screen isn't on/connected.

We've also checked and the PC is set to duplicate screen

Hi all,

Really sorry if you've got this info twice (or this is a surprise to you) but it seems that some Year 8 teachers may not be in the all Year 8 Teacher email group.

I just wanted to remind/tell you that Wednesday 15th (a week today) is a collapsed day for Y8, so your usual lessons will not be running.

We will still need you for supervision, but there is absolutely no preparation required.

I will be in touch with logistics by Friday. But it will just be a case of go to a room and supervise while someone else delivers.

Thanks

Shane

Would it be possible to check that all email groups are accurate. The idea of these groups is to reduce emails and workload but the email below suggests this is not the case. I have also come across other problems in the past when I have used these such as the Hoy email not having the correct people in it.

Thanks

Hi Shane
Just to let you know I think the email groups might not be correct as I've received this and I'm not a Year 8 teacher.
Also - hope you're okay. Jan said you were poorly earlier. Don't rush back!!

Hi all,

Following on from my email before HT, I just wanted to remind you that Wednesday 15th (a week today) is a collapsed day for Y8, so your usual lessons will not be running.

We will still need you for supervision, but there is absolutely no preparation required.

I will be in touch with logistics by Friday. But it will just be a case of go to a room and supervise while someone else delivers.

Thanks

Shane

Subject: New starters

Good afternoon

The new starters have not pulled through to WisePay because your Xporter synchronisation tool is currently failing

On the Groupcall Dashboard I can see two installations, one on server HS-ADMIN01  which is failing as a connection cannot be established and there is another installation under the server HS-ADMIN but there is no WisePay job showing on that

Please can you confirm which server is currently being used and if it is the HS-ADMIN server, the WisePay job with SIMS will need to be installed (please see below and attached)

Olivia Wilson's account has been reactivated.  Please can I ask you to add the class and year group information via manage account profiles and save the changes

Nataliya's account may not have updated from being a pre admission student due to the Xporter tool failing

Groupcall Xporter Installation Process

Xporter is a piece of software (provided by the company Groupcall), which we would like you to install, typically on the school's SIMS server, and is used to automatically synchronise the student/staff data in your MIS with the account data held in WisePay and then to update on a scheduled basis.
I have outlined the steps below that you will need to follow to complete the installation process. Please refer to the install guide that I have attached for greater detail - the guide is called ""WisePay Installer"".
The recommended installation process involves:
1. Setting up a dedicated user on SIMS with the appropriate 4 group memberships (ie i. Personnel Officer, ii. School Administrator, iii. Senior Management Team & iv. Third Party reporting - see install guide)
You may already have a User called “wisepay” (our records show) on SIMS from the previous Xporter in which case you will only need to check the 4 permissions still apply and retrieve the Password as you will probably need to re-enter it during the new install. If you need to set up a new User that's no problem either.

2. Downloading GroupCall Xporter software from the link provided in the attached install guide
or here:      http://www.groupcall.co.uk/clients/Wisepay/Exporter/Wisepay_GroupcallXporter4_Setup.exe

3. Installing/Running the software on your local MIS server (recommended). During the install you will need to enter the User and Password details for the SIMS User created in 1.
4. Entering a Password on the ""WisePay Credentials"" screen, if asked to, towards the end of the install process: the correct password to enter is: groupcall2768 .
5. Notifying WisePay when you have completed the installation so we can check that the student & staff data has transferred correctly.

After the installation process is complete please let us know so that we can check the data has transferred correctly

,T20231108.0215,Access to old CCTV system using IE - via virtual server?,"Hi,

We have an old CCTV system which uses Internet Explorer; we've previously
been able to use various tricks to continue to enable IE to be used for
this system only, however they no longer work.

Is there any way round this, for example could we create a virtual machine
on our VHOST which runs an old copy of Windows/IE, and does not have any
means of accessing the internet, and is dedicated for the purpose of
authorised staff logging on to access the CCTV system?

If someone can be free to discuss this proposal further, I will be free
tomorrow between approx 0850 - 1000 and later from 1130 to 1215.

Many thanks

,T20231108.0190,Question,"Hi

I wonder if there is a way that staff can report IT issues directly rather
than coming through Lucy and I?  Perhaps other schools have something set
up that we could replicate?

We do have a Google form that Lucy and I use to request new accounts,
password resets etc etc and I'm wondering if it possible to have something
setup similar to this that avoids all staff coming via us?  There seems to
be a rumour that we are the IT people and everyone comes to us with their
IT issues - believe me, speaking personally,  this couldn't be further from
the truth (Giles will confirm!)

Examples......How do I convert this file?  My iPAD won't work.... My screen
is broken.... etc etc

It's very disruptive and unnecessary when all we do is fire off an email to
you guys and would be much more efficient if staff can report directly and
explain the issue.  I guess Jonny can then monitor when the right time is
to call in depending on urgency etc.

Thanks in advance!

Dear Hannah,

Good to speak to you earlier, apologies regards the mix-up over the email
address .  This is the first email I sent.  Another one will follow.

The school have been going through a Safeguarding review, working with My
colleague Darren Smith.

As part of that review we are setting up extended monitoring options for
the school.  Before this can be implemented an electronic certificate needs
to be installed on each device that accesses the internet, that would
included but is not restricted to -  Windows devices, Chromebooks and
iPads..

I have attached a zip file that contains the certificate, can you please
pass this on to your support provider, who I believe is Vital and ask them
to install it on all the devices that access the Internet. Also please let
them know that on a Windows device the certificate needs to be installed
into ""Trusted Root Certification Authorities"".

Once they have done this can you please reply to this email to let us know
and we will arrange a switch on date with you.

Feel free to call me on 07971 820092 if you have any questions, or if Vital
have any questions I am happy for you to pass on my mobile number.

Kind regards

Mark

,T20231108.0166,Smartboard problem in S12,"Good afternoon,
I hope that you are well and thrilled at the thought of another half-term.
Although the board could see the desktop earlier today, it now seems to
have forgotten how - even though it is on HDMI 1. I have done the whole
turn it off and then turn it back on thing and run through every other HDMI
but I can’t get it to work! I’m hoping that the effect of you simply
walking into the room will fix it.
Would you be able to help, please?
Thank you,
Clare

Hi Rachel,



I hope you are well and thankyou for replying to my email.



I have done some more testing on your system.



When sending 'Reminders', your system is set to use the default SMTP
settings. This default setting is ""noreply@microlibrarian.net "".



Can you check with your I.T. person that the 'noreply@microlibrarian.net'
email address is not blocked or treated as Spam.





I am also attaching a knowledge base article on Whitelisting. Can you
please pass this to your I.T. people and ensure this is / has been
implemented.

I look forward to hearing back from you on this.

Good Morning Rebecca,

It was lovely to speak with you earlier.

We have tested the issue you were experiencing with Numeracy by Strand but unfortunately we can not replicate it.

Please can you double check the following for me.

1. Make sure that when accessing from a laptop or desktop you are only using Google Chrome to do so.


2. Can you check with your IT department that there are no firewalls that could be causing problems and that the following  URLs have been whitelisted:


https://www.idlsgroup.com/



https://appuk.idlsgroup.com/



https://assets.idlsgroup.com


https://kit.fontawesome.com/494025acac.js


3. Please can you try clearing the cache. To clear the google chrome cache on each device, open up google chrome browser > Click the three vertical dots in the top right corner >Select 'Settings' > Click 'Privacy and Security' within the navigation bar >Select 'Clear browsing data' > Ensure all three boxes are ticked and time range states 'All time' > Click 'clear data'.

If after checking the above the problem still persists, please let us know.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

loaded work on Google Classroom for him, he is unable to open the app in
S17. He is unable to open any of the Google Apps on his chromebook. I have
been printing work for him, but this means I cannot quickly translate what
he has done. His Google Apps work in the LRC, so I don't know if it's just
an issue in S17.
I will teach him in S17 period 3 tomorrow. Would you be able to come and
check his chromebook please?

Hi Wendy,

I am an advisor on a new venture called Pyxos, a new AI-powered software
solution designed to act as support in navigating data privacy and
compliance.

Key features of Pyxos include:

   -

   AI Agents that offer insightful interpretations of GDPR and other
   complex regulations.
   -

   Strategic dialogues with multiple AI agents to eliminate ambiguity and
   enhance compliance processes.


I thought this may be of interest to you / help to us, and also I would be
grateful for any feedback that you have to make the product even better.
You can find Pyxos at app.pyxos.ai.

Feel free to also share with anyone in your network - it's targeted at
small to medium sized entities.

Thanks,

Andy

Hi Lucy

I'm not sure if it is you I am supposed to email about logging IT jobs so
please forgive me if it isn't!

Twigs whiteboard is not working, we think it might be the port that the
HDMI cable plugs in to. It has been a bit unreliable for a while but has
gone completely now.

,T20231108.0019,screen in H14,"Hi
As has been an issue for weeks, the screen in H14 still times out/goes to
sleep randomly. This is disrupting teaching and is very frustrating.

It has now been weeks like this, numerous things have been tried and
unsuccessful.
Surely we are far beyond the time now for a complaint and full replacement
to be implemented. The screen is great but it is faulty (or part of the
installation) and it needs sorting out.

Please can we have an action that finally sorts this problem out? While
typing this email the screen has blacked out 6-7 times!

Thank you.

,T20231108.0017,Microsoft Outlook App,"Morning Craig,

I think this is one you will have to escalate, but I’m just wondering if
it’s possible to get the Microsoft Outlook App allowed/whitelisted so I can
use this for my work emails.

I’ve copied and pasted the error message below:

Error 400: admin_policy_enforced

It worked before the cyberattack and has obviously been blocked now, but I
can’t see why it wouldn’t be a trusted app 🤷🏼‍♂️.  I prefer this app as
it allows me to set working hours so I don’t receive notifications outside
of my working day, and as an added level of security it has Face
ID/passcode protection which Gmail doesn’t have.  Also, it keeps my work
email separate from my personal email.


Thanks,
Gareth

I was hoping you might be able to help me. I have been contacted by one of
the Governors (Will Harris) who is having trouble accessing his Ebor email

you be able to look into this for me just to check there is no problem? Or
can you suggest anything?

Is there anyway we can restore external access to our RDS (without the SSL certificate) our isp are unable to get it to us in the correct format.

We will only need external access to it until the new year. So a temporary fix would be fine.

Hello


I think this may have been a problem before but Emma Hickings laptop is asking for an authorisation key for Active Inspire again so she can't access any slides.

Please could someone attend to have a look at it?

,T20231107.0215,Danesgate queries,"****SEE INTERNAL NOTES****

Good Afternoon,

I just wanted to chase up a few things that Marcus and Joe were looking into.

The bridge still haven't got the Read and Write software on there PC's can someone install it when they next come out? (I know Mateusz came out yesterday, that was my bad I didn't realise that was one of his things to do)

Also, with the Read and Write software some staff log in's aren't recognised and some have only have a partial toolbar. Do we know anymore why this is the case?

I think Joe was speaking to Lynn about a student Maisie Davies who is unable to share her work with teachers. Do you know if this can be resolved?

Finally, Do you know when we will be getting the refurbished PC's for the primary unit?

I hope that makes sense.

Appreciate your time. 

Thanks,

Sam

This is now setup. I will look to tidy the cables more next week on the teacher's training day, but I've done the best I can with what I've got so far.

You will see on your desk a remote and aux cable. Obviously, you just need to plug the AUX into your laptop and you're ready to go. Please note that you will need to turn the speakers ON with the remote.

If you unplug the speakers and plug them back in and get no sound, just try turning the speakers off and on with the remote. There's also a volume function on the remote so you don't have to increase or decrease at your machine.

Thanks,

I've never had a problem like this before and can't fix it ??

Dear ICT Friends,



Your printing for the careers in ICT lessons (first two back after HT) are in the office. I've dumped them on Conrad's desk. There are 240 white plus a selection of coloured copies as required.



I've spotted a mistake, the start of Lesson 2 says Lesson 1 but I'm sure they will survive.



I know Suzy has already send out the details, but the lesson PP is here if you need it for quick reference: [https://res.cdn.office.net/assets/mail/file-icon/png/folder_16x16.png] Careers Research in ICT Lesson<https://huntingtonschool.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/P-DriveResourceFolders/Evf6tqck8AhNj0EgZFDbs-8BhfdC7eM_mIjUsoHBd786Gg?e=bZJIxn>



The Unifrog sign up (Lesson 2) should be pretty easy, but is also very important. We want the whole school on this but we are drip feeding the registrations across different year groups the next year or so.



Thanks so much for delivering it  - any problems - let me know.??

I'm having a strange issue with this PowerPoint...when in presentation mode it won't go forwards or backwards.

I've never had a problem like this before and can't fix it 🙁

If you're at all interested, I'd be grateful of any advice 🙂

Many thanks,
Matt

Dear ICT Friends,

Your printing for the careers in ICT lessons (first two back after HT) are in the office. I've dumped them on Conrad's desk. There are 240 white plus a selection of coloured copies as required.

I've spotted a mistake, the start of Lesson 2 says Lesson 1 but I'm sure they will survive.

I know Suzy has already send out the details, but the lesson PP is here if you need it for quick reference: [https://res.cdn.office.net/assets/mail/file-icon/png/folder_16x16.png] Careers Research in ICT Lesson<https://huntingtonschool.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/P-DriveResourceFolders/Evf6tqck8AhNj0EgZFDbs-8BhfdC7eM_mIjUsoHBd786Gg?e=bZJIxn>

Hi Sarah

Many thanks for this!  Well, I think I'd tried all those before half term, but I did try again tonight in the spirit of co-operation!


  *   Can you ask that they make sure when using Teams in a browser that there isn't another account signed into the browser, they could also do with checking to see which Microsoft account is signed into the device itself if it's a windows machine, this might perhaps be causing some issues.

All our devices are chromebooks or part of the Apple infrastructure (no windows here); the main way we hope(d) to log in was using Sam's iphone or chromebook for which he is the only user of Teams/Microsoft accounts. So I don't think this is the problem, and certainly trying to log out beforehand on his devices was impossible (as he couldn't log in). I also tried deleting the old accounts entirely from the devices (they remember the email address) to no avail.



  *   They could also try using incognito/in-private browsing windows in their browser and see if that fixes the issue.

Tried that with google chrome, with the same result as before.


Sorry about this: I realise it's frustrating for all parties. And curious, given that the new password you gave me at the end of the last half term worked ... once! But here we are...

Thanks

Good evening,
I have asked out tech team if they had any further suggestions which might help with the login challenges Sam is having.
These are the things they suggested trying:

Can you ask that they make sure when using Teams in a browser that there isn't another account signed into the browser, they could also do with checking to see which Microsoft account is signed into the device itself if it's a windows machine, this might perhaps be causing some issues.

They could also try using incognito/in-private browsing windows in their browser and see if that fixes the issue.

I know they may sound obvious but I know from using my own computers at home, sometimes once a Microsoft login is used on a machine, it sometimes gets stuck in the background and it is very difficult to entirely disconnect it!

I hope this is helpful.
Kind regards
Sarah

Subject: Re: Teams - Sam Venn

Hate to say it, but we're back to square one with teams. Sam tried on Thurs 26 to log on with his new password (which worked on the Monday) but once again, across multiple systems and different ways of trying to access Teams, he's being told the email and password combination aren't working. Hugely frustrating for us and I'm sure you too.

Teams access for the multiple organisations I use it for as part of my job work well, so it's not a problem with Microsoft products per se from this location. But clearly there's something up with Sam's account that is causing issues with the password.

Sorry to ask, but could you have a look again at this after half term?

Ed

Dear Mr Venn



I am sorry to send another email, however, I wanted to let you know that I have also alerted Sam's Head of Year to the problem you are having with Teams.



I also must apologise as looking back at the email chain, I think I only sent the image to the ICT teacher rather than your whole email and, therefore, I don't think she realised that you had already tried this.  So, apologies for your frustration, I think in my haste to sort this I failed to send her all the information.



Please be assured that we will sort this out and that Sam will not be in any trouble for failing to do my homework.



Best wishes

,T20231107.0041,My laptop,"Good morning,

I spoke to someone about this issue a couple of weeks ago but unfortunately
it doesn’t seem to have resolved and I am hoping you can help please.

My laptop takes an incredibly long time when loading up and “Applying Group
Printers policy” (often 15 minutes or more just for this step).

Then, when I am trying to print, it requires me to manually add the St
Lawrence’s printers (Colour & Mono) individually through the settings menu
EVERY TIME I want to print a document.

Is there any way of sorting the printers on my laptop so it doesn’t take so
much time to load up and so that it remembers these two printers please?

Many thanks,
Monique Klar

Please could her accounts be synced and changed over from Atkinson to Crow.
All her emails will need to remain in her inbox and drive permissions still
to have the same access along with any shared documents still being the

I spoke with Marcus yesterday and he said this was possible.

I just wondered if there was a way to give children in Y2/3 or even Y2-6 a
QR code that would log them into the chromebook instantly?

I saw it in another school and I think it would help us get them onto
chromebooks earlier and quicker, which means more learning.

We can't use the pen to write over/annotate slides. This makes teaching
much harder. This is the message when I go into settings.

I know that you have been to this board a few times this term and have
stopped it shutting down many times a day which is great. If you could sort
this too everything will be working perfectly.

Many thanks

Hi,

I don't know if it's vital or NPCAT IT support that I need to contact but
my laptop seems to have really slowed down in the last few weeks. It seems
to be crashing all the time and things are loading up properly or taking
ages to open. It's usable but if  there is any possibility of a
new/replacement laptop or for someone to look at it, that would be great,
thanks.
Many thanks,
Helen Mackenzie

Didn't spot this earlier but quite urgent. Can you create/copy accross the L Drive Music Technology subject folder to the Media Drive? Staff and Student resource folders needed, like the Music folder.

If student doc folders can only be seen in the existing Music folder, then maybe create the Music Technology folder as a subfolder in the Music folder... if that would work?

Thanks
Ian

I just tried to join a Google meet and it didn't recognise my webcam or
mic. I was meant to do some work with a buddy from another school and I've
just had to give it a miss today but I need it to be working for this time
in 2 weeks and even more vitally for an important meeting on the 27th. It
will be some small setting I need to press I'm sure but I'm puzzled as I
did one 2 weeks ago and it worked no problem!

Could you advise what settings I might need to change or select etc and
where to find them? I'll need to write them down or I'll forget again....

,T20231106.0271,Fwd: Flu Vaccinations,"Hi Tom,

Our parents are having issues accessing a link sent out on behalf of the
North Yorkshire Immunisation Team to give consent for the Flu Vaccine. I
have contacted them and they have sent a different link to use instead, but
when I click on this I have the same problem. I just get an error message
404 NOT FOUND. Is this likely to be an issue at our end or at their end?
Please could you have a look at the 2 links and see if there is anything we
can do from our end?

Hi Catherine,

I have enquired about SAM Learning with their Director and apparently I
need my work email adding to SIMS under  'main', 'work' and 'primary'.
Please could you do this? SAM Learning will then do a sync which
should provide me with an account.

Thanks
Luke

Hello Luke

Sorry for the slow reply, I've been on leave.

I'd be very happy to spend time with you showing what you have and what SAM
Learning can do. Your school is very special to us due to the
relationship we have with Lesley and with the former VP Natasha prior to
her moving on.

Your current subscription is until the end of February, but we'd love
nothing more than for you to stay with us so do talk to us! Up until last
year when Richard took over, your students were completing tens of
thousands of hours working on SAM Learning.

In a nutshell, SAM Learning is the only software with EEF evidence that it
increases GCSE grades. Ot provides for almost all subjects at KS3 and GCSE,
auto marks, provides immediate feedback, A.I. fills gaps, extends knowledge
and also interleaves work to make sure it's secure. The A.I. provides
students with guided revision and even sets work every week on it's own in
English Lang, Maths and the three sciences.

Your work email is missing from SIMS so you don;t have a SAM Learning
account yet - please have your work email added and set to 'main', 'work'
and 'primary'. Once doen we can force a sync to your MIS.

*Your students login *using their school email address, in this manner:
UserID: school email address
Password: school email address
CentreID: not needed for your school

(login page is here: www.https://platform.samlearning.com)

*Staff login using their UserID:*

If you login and click 'Profile' -> ""Teacher data' you will see all staff
userIDs and you can reset all of them (sending them an email too from
there).

I'll reset your login details now so you get an email to login.

Here is my diary <https://calendly.com/nmckie/30min>: please book in with
me here. You have free support and training from me, as much as you want :)

I'll send you a launch pack separately too.

I look forward to speaking with you soon,
Neil

you an idea of what SAM Learning does)

,T20231106.0232,Carr Junior - Access Control,"Hi Rob,

Someone from Vital came out on Friday to look at the data cabling for the
access controlled doors, he advised he would be able to attend today to
terminate the remaining 8 cables into the correct switch on the 1st floor
so they are connected to the ground floor cab.

I was just wondering if you know what time he will be attending as he said
it would be in the morning?

I was also wondering if someone would be able to set me up with a VPN
connection to the PC where the Net2 system and server was installed (Ali's
PC) to allow remote access to the system?

Please can someone also install the client software onto Vicki's PC to
allow her access to the Net2 system?

*Client software:* https://paxton.info/1438

I've attached an info sheet from Paxton with regards to access for myself
and Vicki.

Thank you in advance and I look forward to hearing from you.

Case Description:

Hi there,

We are using Sibelius 7.1.3 and every time we try to add a new instrument, the software crashes.

I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling both Sibelius 7 and Sibelius 7 Sounds, and I've made sure all drivers are up to date.

Do you have any advice on what else I could try to resolve this issue?

Many thanks

,T20231106.0153,Qustion about system configuration,"Good Morning,

I am the lead for People at Ebor academy and following a recent audit have
identified that there would be a benefit in reminding staff of their
responsibilities around use of IT and systems.

I would like to put in a pop-up for every Ebor user which comes up when
they sign on and reminds them of the key responsibilities (a quick, text
box message) and then requires them to 'ACCEPT' before they can gain
further system access.

Is there somebody at Vital who could help me with this and advise
whether it is possible and how to arrange for it to be implemented?

Many Thanks

,T20231106.0114,Chemistry Prep room,"Hi Binny

I am just writing to reiterate what I have already conveyed to you about
the downstairs prep room being used as an office.
It is not an office! Solutions are prepared in there, requisitions are put
in there ready to go into labs etc. This room has always been a prep room.
Technicians work there on computers so they do not have to spend all day in
the chemical storeroom. The previous Head of Science only used the room
when he had no lab of his own and was moving from room to room, the
computer which became available in there and which James used was made
available due to a technician leaving. As far as I can see from your
timetable there are only 2 periods a week where there isn't a lab for you
to use as a work space and the science work room is available at this time.
In terms of preparation and storage we (Technicians) are already squashed
for space. We need clear spaces in order to prepare our requisitions. The
downstairs prep room is where we prepare the acids and alkalis to use as
lab reagents and is the only fume hood available to us. Outside of the fume
hood we need areas to place what we are working on and to have access to
plugs for balances etc.
The computer which has been placed in the prep room for you to use
has taken up an extremely greedy amount of space and is not at all
considerate of the work which takes place in there, the screens are huge! I
believe Sarah has moved it along a little to give herself room to work, but
it is still a lot more than was ever there before, and a lot more than
Sarah has for her own desk and she works in there all the time.
Kind regards

Liz Testa

Mike - not in at the moment and I need a massive favour.

Btec kids are in the middle of video assessments.
Can you download the videos for me and put them in Google. Kate won’t have
time to do it. The cameras will need to go back on charge.

The folder link is:

,T20231106.0067,USB Ports - Deactivation,"Morning,

I understand USb ports are being deactivated as standard for Ebor/Vital
managed laptops.  Some of us use wireless mice and keyboards and just
wanted to check that the functionality of these won't be affected as the
bluetooth is powered through the USB port.

Hi Hannah

Hope you had a lovely holiday.

It appears that my l.wainwright@ebor.academy account has been disabled as
of the 2nd of November. I assume it is due to my no longer being a staff
member but someone hasn't realised that I am still a governor. Is it
possible to get this account reactivated any time soon?

Item 1
I managed to spill a cup of tea over the end of my laptop over the holiday
and it won't turn on now. Please can this be repaired or replaced asap?

Item 2
Lewis also mentioned coming into school to do an audit of the stock we have
and plans for moving forward.

One thing that I want to consider is reducing the chrome books to 75 chrome
books.

Item 3
A while ago we had some inappropriate pop ups and it was agreed that pop
ups would be blocked going forward. We still have pop ups popping up as
soon as you log onto a chrome book, please can all these be blocked as it
just wastes time having to close all these down before the children can
access their own google accounts.

document I created last week and now I can't seem to be able to find!! No
doubt human error on my part, I suspect I may have inadvertently deleted it.
On Tuesday 25th October, whilst working at New Earswick Primary School I
created a simple Excel spreadsheet to try and review the income and costs
for the Nursery provision at New Earswick. I would have saved it in
V:\NEP\Adrian - SBM\School Business Manager but there is no sign of it
there and it is not coming up in any searches I have done.
I am not sure exactly what I would have called the file but the title would
almost certainly have contained the words 'Nursery' or Smarties'
Any help you are able to give would be much appreciated.

Many thanks

Subject: Re: Teams - Sam Venn

Hate to say it, but we're back to square one with teams. Sam tried on Thurs 26 to log on with his new password (which worked on the Monday) but once again, across multiple systems and different ways of trying to access Teams, he's being told the email and password combination aren't working. Hugely frustrating for us and I'm sure you too.

Teams access for the multiple organisations I use it for as part of my job work well, so it's not a problem with Microsoft products per se from this location. But clearly there's something up with Sam's account that is causing issues with the password.

Sorry to ask, but could you have a look again at this after half term?

Dear Mr Venn



I am sorry to send another email, however, I wanted to let you know that I have also alerted Sam's Head of Year to the problem you are having with Teams.



I also must apologise as looking back at the email chain, I think I only sent the image to the ICT teacher rather than your whole email and, therefore, I don't think she realised that you had already tried this.  So, apologies for your frustration, I think in my haste to sort this I failed to send her all the information.



Please be assured that we will sort this out and that Sam will not be in any trouble for failing to do my homework.



Best wishes

This will allow you to do what you need.

I’ll be sending out this extra detail via the Red Box on Monday and
probably to all staff too.

,T20231101.0094,Footer on return emails,"Hi

As the latest in my bid to get to the bottom of our new email footer saga, I've established with one recipient that she doesn't see the grey box above which often appears when people reply to my emails. It's there instead of the footer in their replies. But at the top of the message, not the bottom.

To recap, we haven't rolled out the footer below because I thought recipients of my emails were seeing the grey box which appears in replies, instead of the footer. But if this one person doesn't see the grey box but does see the footer as intended, is it therefore something to do with our firewall that means we don't get to see the footer in return emails? Which in itself isn't a worry but it makes me concerned that other companies with firewalls may get the grey box instead of the footer.

Can you advise, please?

Thanks

Claire

Dear Stuart,



Bit of an odd one but is there any way this link (https://bouncyballs.org/) could be allowed on my computer? It’s a noise meter website which tracts the noise levels in the classroom using bouncy balls however, it’s been blocked. No worries if not.



Thank you,

Hi Tim



Just had a chat with DfE regarding this one.  They are saying ‘Connect the

Please can you arrange for this to be checked, if not Monday will be OK.

,T20231031.0018,YHS Static IP address queries,"Hi,

I am looking at our static IP address list and trying to free up some IP
addresses for our new building management system which is being
commissioned this week.

Firstly, is our server RDS-SQL redundant? It's on our static IP address
list as 10.44.236.34 and the server still exists in Active Directory,
however it's not turned on and pinging this address gets no response, and
it appears it was a Win 2012 server, so I am assuming it's no longer
needed, is that right?

Secondly, I have an entry for 10.44.236.36 for 'CYC Fibre Network Gateway';
we no longer go through the CYC network, and if I ping this IP address I
get nothing back, so presumably this is redundant too?

Hopefully it can be confirmed that I can reallocate the above IP addresses
to be used by our building management system, but I thought I best check
with you first, in case there is anything I am missing!

Many thanks in advance

,T20231030.0077,Terrington Hall office printer default settings,"Good morning

I spoke to someone in your office a couple of weeks ago about adjusting the settings for my office printer - it defaults to print to the finance office and in black and white. I asked that you please alter the settings on the server (or wherever) so that my login/username defaults to the office printer and in colour/auto across all programmes. It doesn't matter how many times I change the settings on my pc, if reverts back to the finance printer and in black and white - I have altered the settings this morning but when I revisited the printer settings it has reverted back, so this must be something that needs to happen at your end.

With thanks

I hope you're well.

There is a new patch and fileset needed for the school workforce census which is this week.

It has been authorised for all sites so would you be able to schedule it in or give me connection details and I will pop on and schedule for this evening.

The patch is CDP4 - 28506
Fileset - 2506

I have been emailing individual technicians to request access to the schools we support but one of them has come back to me to say it would be best to contact the helpdesk for access instead.

Could you please give me access to the following sites to be able to do the work:

St James Church of England Academy - Hull
Archbishop Sentamu Academy - Hull
Aspire Academy - Hull
Newland St John's Church of England Academy - Hull

Is there any chance I can keep at least one of my USB ports open please?  I

the mouse pad on the laptop but I can't!  The USB sensor stick that picks
up the mouse is cordless and remains in my laptop at all times so I don't
ever remove it.

After having the screen looked at this lunch time, it has still turned
itself off/gone into sleep mode when it shouldn't. It needed more testing

There is still an issue and it still needs resolving!

As a senco I constantly need to scan confidential documents onto a USB and
pass them on through EDT to professionals. This is an imperative part of my
job and there is no other way around this.

I am therefore requesting access to a USB port on the printer and at least
one computer at Marfleet Academy

Please could someone move a small bookcase from SFS to SFL during P5? It's

who's wheels have fallen off after the last time I moved it!!

The Green Chromebook Trolley will need moving to Courtyard Cafe during 1/2
term & the Purple one will need to go to SFS - the colours are important
here.

As we're swapping rooms with reflection at some point - please can the desk
I have now be swapped with the one in reflection which is the one I had
when I had my DSE assessment & we identified it needed swapping - my back,
neck & shoulder have been much better since using this desk & chair! I have
left my belongings in the desk drawers.

We uploaded our newsletter today but we cannot see it. If you are not in

Apparently another school has reported the same issue to him.
I have copied Tim Moat as I don't know if it affects everyone?  I have

I spoke to finance about the possibility of additional printers and at this stage the answer is no as all of our printers are leased and the renewal is due in 2025. To add to our current contract would be too expensive and the fact that we have coped up to this point means that a business case would not be approved. The other option is to look at how the current printers are positioned in the school and this was raised yesterday in our SLT meeting. I'm going to review our current use of printers to see if they are best placed and I will obviously take your request into consideration. I'm also looking at the second floor as they dont have a printer either and a request has been made there. I will let you know my thoughts after I have looked at the current use of printers.

Thanks

,T20231026.0059,Adobe Express for Education - Pathfinder Multi Academy Trust,"From Steve Shenton <steven.shenton@Tablet.Academy>: Good Morning,

It's Steve here from the TA Education technical support team, we are currently working alongside Adobe to support UK schools with the deployment of Adobe Express for Education. We have received sign-ups for access to Adobe Express for the following schools:-


  *   Badger Hill Primary Academy
  *   Tockwith Primary
  *   Tang Hall Primary School
  *   Hempland Primary School

I can see that they are all adding the IT Admin contact as help@vitalyork.com<mailto:help@vitalyork.com>.

As one email address has been mentioned from the above schools, the Admin Console access would be granted to help@vitalyork.com<mailto:help@vitalyork.com>, this means that all schools can be managed from one admin console. Are you happy for me to go ahead and invite help@vitalyork.com<mailto:help@vitalyork.com> to Adobe?

Once the invite has been sent and is accepted, the next stage of the process is to complete the deployment steps noted in this guide here<https://www.adobe.com/uk/education/schools/deployment.html>, you will observe videos for O365 and Google.
This step will need to be completed for each school requesting access, once the first school is setup, additional schools can be added in the Adobe admin console<https://adminconsole.adobe.com/> via the ""Settings > Create Directory"" options.

Please let me know if you have any questions along the way, I am here to support!

Please can I log further whiteboard issues in Year 5/6 at Sproatley? There
are still ongoing issues with the new whiteboards following the desktop
computer updates over the summer. The pens are not always working and the
touch screen doesn't work all of the time. There is regularly a beeping
sound that sounds like a loose connection connecting and disconnecting. The
boards also still come on with a pink tinge until you unplug and plug back
in to the computer. The boards not being interactive is affecting teaching
and learning - please could someone come and look? Someone had already
visited but couldn't resolve the issues.

,T20231025.0096,JRV little fixes,"Hello James,

These are the little fixes that I need that I told you I was collecting in one go:


  *   Need SIMS on the iMac, if possible.
  *   Need password restore on SIMS (can’t log in at the moment) – the only thing that’s is Urgent but I guess the easier to do.
  *   Need to clean the printer log-in, to replace it with the right one so I don’t need to ask for a reprint all the time to correct the log in.
  *   Need to check why I can’t access the files on the ipad, when linked with the cable to the imac.  Can be some obvious thing that I don’t realise but  at the moment it makes me have to upload the recorded lessons on the one drive by the wireless network which takes ages, and also I need to go to the main hall to get a better signal (unless we can put a router in my office).


Thank you


João

Is someone free to do a remote session tomorrow morning? I have a

says we need to update our browser, but if you copy the link and paste it
in to a new window, it then works but because there is a lot of assessment
data that needs to be entered, it would be easier if the spreadsheet links
worked.

I have attached the spreadsheet and the update browser message.

,T20231024.0044,"Laptop Camera Access, Direct Line & Printers","Good morning,

I was wondering if I could please get some support.

Firstly, when I have attempted to use the camera on my laptop, it will not
allow me to do so, even when I allow access. When I have gone to settings
it says it is admin controlled. Would it be possible to allow access for
things like Teams meetings please?

Secondly, the direct line that was set up for me doesn't seem to be
working. The extension number works fine so I was wondering if someone
could please look into this?

Finally, last week I spoke to Joe about adding printers at St Lawrence's to
my printer list. We were able to get to the point where I could manually
add printers to my print list, but it is requiring me to do this for every
document I wish to print and not allowing me to print some pdf's at all.
Could I please get some support in getting this sorted?

Many thanks,

We got a new printer delivered to the Leyes last week and after speaking
with John from Agilico, I understand that he needs to work with you, in
order to set up the following features on the new printer which we had on
the old printer;

- The V:Drive folders which we can select via the printer to scan a
document / file to (Finance>Scans, HR > Scans, CST > Scans)

- Usernames for each staff member to prevent printed documents from getting
muddled together. I understand that our Data and Compliance Officer feels
this needs to be prioritised to avoid the risk of confidential information
being seen by staff members who shouldn't see it.

I have provided John with your contact number (0344 873 6100) and
understand that he will be in touch with you shortly.

Many thanks in advance.

Dear Exams Officer


*If you no longer use EDI or A2C please ignore this communication. *
A new version of the A2C transport application was made available over a
year ago and centres were encouraged to download this as it supports a more
secure transport mechanism.

We will be disabling any older version on *29 September* which means you
will be unable to connect to the A2C server unless you update to the new
version that is available.

,T20231023.0176,My home connection to Teams,"Hi

As you know, I'm unable to access Teams files via my laptop at home. At the end of last week I had a long session with (Marcus I think?), who accessed my laptop remotely. When we established that I could access Teams files via my mobile phone hotspot, he said it must be an issue with my broadband provider.

I've therefore arranged for a home visit by BT just now, whose engineer categorically told me my hub and broadband connection are working well and I have no restrictions on access to any sites. Therefore BT is in no way blocking my access to Teams files.

Could it be something to do with the fact it's not a work laptop and therefore the school settings are blocking access to Teams?

Many thanks

Claire

Hi,
I’ve set up a shared drive for my Reading Teacher group. Most people are
pmat so adding them is easy. There’s one from Westfield which is CYC and
the drive doesn’t accept her email address as it’s the wrong format. Any
suggestions how to add her? Her personal email address doesn’t work either.

Thanks,

,T20231020.0186,VYLHD - Disable Cameras on Student Devices,"Hi guys,

Please can we sort out a gpo to disable cameras on laptops for
seclusion and also disable cameras on chromebooks for students in seclusion
also?

For the seclusion chromebooks, I'm guessing you will need the
specific serial numbers?

For the windows laptops, a gpo can be applied directly to the seclusion
laptop ou?

Best regards,
Lee

Are we any closer to testing out the new Media Drive? You mentioned the end of October as a possible launch, so hoping next week.

I realise it'll be a bit of a task to get it properly up and running but is it possible to start next week at some point? Then students might b able to start using it from the start of next half term (06/11).

Also in addition the MS Licencing review i understand we are currently on

Will every user have to have the same licence or do we have the option of

What has our LSP suggested?

Also are you able to provide all the SAM information for software outside

At the Chairs’ Group meeting in July, I was asked to investigate whether a
shared Google drive could be set up for LGC chairs? I guess an email group
would also be useful as well. Is this possible please?

I’ve attached a list of chairs and email addresses.

laser cutter. This was sent today to Susie from HPC the laser cutter
manufacturer.

However to install the software we also need the hardware upgrade in the
form of the circuit board. We know that it has been ordered but as of yet
do not know if it has been delivered.

Do we have any updates regarding the delivery of the circuit board?

Giles said that the PC’s are being replaced at half term, if this is still
the case then the logical order of installation will be as follows:

1) Replace the circuit board in the laser cutter

2) Install the new PC for the laser cutter

3) Install the new laser cutter software using the link below.

Thank you

Hi there,

Is there any chance you could contact Vital (or grab them quickly when they
are in next) to ask them to look at our ipad.
When we try and take a photo it keeps coming up with notifications saying
that it is 'unable to install .. then different apps come on. If you press
OK it keeps going round and round in circles and if you press settings the
notifications still continue to pop up so we can't do anything!

Any help would be greatly appreciated as we really need this ipad working
for photos.

Many thanks,

Jen.x

Hi Debbie



Gentle reminder as I would like to request a short call with you to discuss
your agreement options, as your current contract is due for renewal soon.
For example, you might want to consider the CSP agreement instead of the
open value subscription, which could offer you more benefits. Kindly let me
know if you would like to have a further discussion.



Looking forward to hearing from you soon



Kind Regards

explain the process in more detail and understand your needs based on your
organization’s road map and strategy. I can also answer any questions you
may have at this stage.



Please let me know your preferred time slot for the call, and I will send
you a meeting invitation. Alternatively, You can book a call with me at

Subject: Head's direct phone line


Hi Adam

Please could you stop the Head's direct phone line from giving out its number when she makes outside calls?  Prior to the switch the direct lines used to give out the main office number but this seems to have changed.

If she needs to talk to a parent and phones them from her office they get her direct line which isn't ideal.

Kind regards

One student is Isaac Moor (who is now in year 12) so I am thinking these
are old exam accounts that have been used in previous years. Most of the
files are deleted but with Leo's case I could open and see some of the
files. Luckily they are not IT subject related but still need looking into.

Hi Debbie



I hope you are well?



Elvington’s Open Value Subscription Education Solutions Agreement
(Microsoft Licensing) anniversary date is on 31-10-23. Please could you
send me the current FTE staff count so we can raise a quote. Please see
below on how to calculate the current FTE count:



*MICROSOFT OPEN VALUE SUBSCRIPTION - EDUCATIONAL SOLUTIONS 2023 Anniversary*

As a reminder, the OVS-ES charge is calculated by counting the following
employees:

   - head teacher
   - deputy and assistant head teachers
   - teachers
   - teaching assistants
   - departmental assistants
   - administration staff

The following employees do not need to be counted:

   - cleaning staff
   - catering staff
   - midday supervisory assistants
   - site maintenance staff

You also do not need to count any employees, whatever their role, who work
under 200 hours per year. That is approximately 5 hours a week for term
time only staff. If your employee count increases or decreases during the
year, this only needs to be declared at the renewal of your agreement.
Students do not need to be counted at any point as they are eligible to use
the Microsoft products covered by OVS-ES without any additional charge
provided you have a valid



Regards

If I ask the laptop to print, it first says not responding. Then eventually
shows me this message.

The only way I can print at present is to email our technician to do that
for me. This  takes up a lot of her very precious time.

Can this please be sorted soon, as I do not want to be in the same
situation as last year.

2. Can you arrange for one of the spare HP laptops to be provided to RBA -
she will need this for working from home and a Chromebook isn't sufficient
I'm afraid
3. Can you let me know the spec required for the 3d printer computer so
that I can ask the trust if this can be procured from the IT Budget.
4. The copier company has been informed and acknowledged collection, we are
just waiting on a date from their collections team

,T20230926.0089,St George's York - trolley laptops,"Hello Vital,

Denise Walker in Y1 tried emailing you but didn't get a response or an
automatic ticket-logged acknowledgement, so I said (since she is teaching
right now!) that I'd get in touch about this - not sure if there is an
existing ticket or if it might have been the wrong email address.

I've copied her message below!

The laptops in question are the ones (no longer used by pupils or staff in
school since they moved to using the Chromebooks) which are in the trolley
in the staffroom.

If a handful of these could be set up as basic staff-use laptops with
Office/Smart Notebook and configured so that they can be used on or
off-site it would really solve a problem for some staff! At least two, but
it might be sensible to create a small 'bank' of perhaps 5 so that staff
can use them for e.g. off-site training and so on too.

Thanks
Kat

,T20230920.0240,Laptops,"Hello,

We have two staff laptops that have been out of school since last
academic year, to be fixed.

Please can you give me an update on these?

One is our Deputy headteacher, who was set up with one (of three) new
laptops. However, it broke very soon after she was set up with it. It was
sent away but we haven't heard anything since.

The second is a teacher's laptop - I have the serial number for this one,
which is:   1JZ6Y93
Again, this was taken away for fixing (it wasn't brand new, but was a touch
screen one) and we haven't heard back.

Please can I have an update on these as our headteacher is chasing them as
well.

Kind regards

,T20230919.0232,Internet L40,"Hi

We need to have the internet in L40 and L39 (studio) looked at.

We have had problems in the past and last year Kevin told us the server
system needed looking at, of course he has now left.

One problem is the internet connection on some/most of the computers.
The internet seems to constantly keep slowing up and sometimes stopping
altogether. This gives students problems when logging on and connecting to
the shared area. I also have great problems when uploading large files and
undertaking software updates.

There is another syncing problem linked to the school password system that
also needs looking at.

Another problem is the sudden blocking of sites we use for music lessons.

I am in Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays if it is possibkle to arrange
someone to have a proper look at it.

,T20230919.0210,Screen problem affecting kids with neurodiversity,"... of which there are quite a few.
Hello,
I am emailing a second email about this issue on behalf of Graham Reagan.
We have an issue with the screen in H3 which is related to the computer.
The screen will show what's on the computer screen but only really small
which makes the font size hard to read especially for those with
neurodiversity. It is used every lesson because instead of printing out the
recipes we have gone to paperless and the kids are expected to read the
recipe from the screen which is currently very difficult. When using the
actual projector however it seems to work, but as soon as you show
something like a Google Doc from the computer it changes, Please can you
help?
Thank you!

Hi

I hope you've had a nice weekend!

Just a quick email with all the bits I can think of that I need some help
with!

- Remote printing - I can not log into printers with my ID card

- Chromebook switch to microsoft laptop - I can only print to specific
printers and it is not working properly for me, leaving me without
resources for lessons. I also would then have access to proper Sims. I did
request a Chromebook when given the choice between the two, I hope it's ok
to switch!

- Please can someone sit with me and go through Sims and CPOMs as I haven't
had any training on them and they are new programs (I've been using Edulink
for registers)


The classes who are giving me a bit of a run for my money are 10x/Sc3 and
10x/Sc4. All other classes are alright. Even my Y11s have warmed to me and
I've enjoyed my last few lessons with them. As I said before, it's
different challenges here to what I'm used to but in general I'm enjoying
the energy of the classes and the staff have been so welcoming.

I have had a think and I would like some more responsibility in the
department, however would need to keep to 4 days a week. With Marty working
the job he does, our weekends are often very busy with his work and as you
can imagine having that day in the week off is important for my sanity (!!)
and allows me to actually relax for a minute. I'll send an application into
Toby and see what he says. I'm particularly interested in developing KS3
resources and SOW and some STEM bits. I'm considering signing up to the Eco
Club course this week, just need to double check the never ending juggle
that is chlldcare!

Thank you for taking the time to chat to me the other day. I could have
said I was alright, whisked off to my car and had a cry on the way home,
but it felt good to share how I was feeling!

See you on Tuesday,

Carole

,T20230721.0161,Lord Deramore's - door fob management software,"Hello Vital

Lauren (admin office) in Lord Deramore's has a problem with the door fob
management system there. It is on a PC in the bottom of the cab in the
server room and physical access to the doo-berry for scanning and
programming the key fobs has always been an issue.

Things have now got even more complicated, since someone from the CCTV firm
has been in, in that the monitor that she would usually use appears to now
be showing the cctv system. Lauren wasn't there when they did this, so
doesn't know what exactly they did!

Two questions:
1) is there a KVM switch in that cab that she should be able to use? She
said that the monitor was now seemingly connected to the cctv but wasn't
able to make sense of/prepared to fiddle with (very sensibly!) any of the
cabling for fear of accidentally disconnecting something important. If
there is, can someone please show Lauren what to do so that she can *see
the blinking software* and sort out security fobs for the September new
starters/leavers?

2) As a less immediate concern, can this software be moved to anywhere less
hideously inconvenient? I think it is running on the original PC that was
supplied when the school was built - so a machine that was second hand over
6 years ago, which probably isn't ideal - and the scrabbling in the bottom
of a comms cab in the server room is a bit of a nightmare whenever they
need to reprogram a fob. Or, if you can't help with this, can you point us
in the direction of someone who can?

We did mention briefly the door fob thing to Marcus when the easter
changeover was happening, but I think that we all forgot about following up
on it since!

Lauren is TTO but I *think* might be in some days over the holidays, and be
contacted on the main school email (lordderamores.primary@york.gov.uk), her
school email (lcharlton-mathews@lordderamores.com) or you could try ringing
the school,

Thanks
Kat
