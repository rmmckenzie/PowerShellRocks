Hi Ben,

I believe the best way to resolve this would be for your IT to update the SSL certificate manually on the InVentry system with my below instructions.


1. _**On the sign in screen, triple click on the InVentry Logo on your home screen - this is usually in the bottom left of the screen**_
2. _**When the keypad appears enter the first 4 digits of your Anywhere ID (0632) or 1234**_
3. _**From the options that appear please select 'Shutdown InVentry', you will then see a normal PC desktop**_
4. _**An orange box will appear in the bottom right corner, please tap this then press 'Ok' in the window that appears in the centre of the screen (if you miss this the sign in screen will reload and you will need to complete the first 3 steps again.**_
5. _**Log off the InVentry_system user**_
6. _**Log onto the local admin user ""Inventry"" with the password ""Inventry1983"" (capital ""i"")**_
7. _**Run through steps 1-4 again to close down the software**_

Cut the ""Silent Installer"" folder to the below location.

C:\Program Files\Inventry\V4

Cut the 2 certificate files to the below location.

C:\Program Files\Inventry\V4\Service

Once the files are in the correct folders, go back into the ""Silent Installer"" and right click ""Run as administrator"" on the ""Silent Installer.exe""

This should then present a CMD prompt and confirm the results of the SSL certificate update.

You can also confirm this by opening a new CMD window and entering the below command.

Netsh HTTP show sslcert

Please note you will have to extract the .RAR files.

Kind regards,
Brett.

Thanks for getting back to me.

Without TeamViewer access, we're unable to remote onto the unit.

I would like to avoid a site visit charge to update an SSL certificate, so we apprciate the assistance.

I wonder if you could help me get logged in to Teams here at BIS so that I can organise meetings? I've been in touch with CYC about permissions but had this response:

Unfortunately, your CYC webmail account is not licenced for Teams, hence the message you are receiving.  In order to access Teams you will need to register an address that is associated with your schools Microsoft licence.  Your schools ICT service provider should be able to provide more guidance on setting this up.

Hoping you can help.

,T20240627.0152,[HIGH] Alert for Sophos Central [Ebor Academy Trust]: We detected ransomware,"From do-not-reply@central.sophos.com: SOPHOS CLOUD

This email alert was generated by Sophos Central. Do not reply to this email.

Sophos Central Event Details for Ebor Academy Trust

What happened: We detected ransomware trying to encrypt files on network shares.


Where it happened: CN7S9W2



What was detected: CryptoGuard


User associated with device: EBOR\d.byerley


How severe it is: High


Detected IP Address: 10.18.123.124



What Sophos has done so far: The IP address where we detected ransomware is assigned to this computer, so we have blocked its write access to the network shares. If the computer is a workstation or server, and Protect document files from ransomware (CryptoGuard) is enabled, we clean up the ransomware automatically.


What you need to do: 1. Make sure that Protect document files from ransomware (CryptoGuard) is enabled in the Sophos Central policy. This provides more information. 
 2. If cleanup doesn’t happen automatically: Move the computer to a network where it is not a risk to other computers. Then go to the computer and run Sophos Clean (available in the Sophos directory).
 3. Go to Sophos Central, go to Alerts, and mark the alert as resolved.

Good Afternoon,



We attended site to upgrade the fire and intruder alarm monitoring unit but
were unable to connect the monitoring to your IP network as port A/106
(above ceiling in store room where control panel is located) isn’t
configured to use.



I believe this port needs to be patched to an external switch, port 50561
opened and set to DHCP and reserve an IP address.



Please can you speak to you IT company, which I believe is Vital, to carry
out this work or put me in touch with them so we can deal with them
directly?

Paula- I am around this afternoon to help with setup, I think you said you are?

João/James- we need to make sure the laptop/projection facilities are working in both the hall and dining hall this afternoon in readiness for tomorrow morning. Please can you be on hand in case of any issues?

,T20240626.0447,Microsoft sign in,"Hi

I've started to get a pop up asking me to sign into Microsoft when I try to
open word or excel documents.  It started yesterday and I've had it today.
I ignored it  but it now says I'm using an unlicensed product. (I can
still use them at the moment)
Should I have a Microsoft username and password.  is it one I already use?
Any advice will be gratefully recieved

,T20240626.0441,Simon Walker - Adobe Reader,"Hi,

Could you please check Simon Walker (History) Acrobat reader.

Thanks, Pete - unfortunately I can't open it in the current format because
I don't have Adobe Reader, and also seemingly can't download Adobe Reader
because (I think) a system administrator has to enter some login details in
order for that to happen. Would it be possible to send it in a different
format? If not I'll see if IT can set up Adobe Reader for me.

This would help with a project we are working on.

Regards

Pete

*Act now to ensure your Cashless system works in September.*
As one of the UK’s leading cashless catering providers, we know that calls
to our helpdesk will always peak when children head back to school in late
August and early September.
Between the end of summer term and the start of the autumn term our
Cashless support team will be looking to dial into as many schools as
possible to perform health checks for the new term.  When contacted please
respond and confirm a date when access can be arranged.
*Here are our top tips to avoid common Cashless pitfalls:*
*1. Act now!* Almost all problems are avoidable with a bit of planning and
we’re here to help. Don’t risk a disrupted lunch service when schools
return.

*2. Check if any IT changes are planned *and *tell us before Friday 28 June
2024 *so that we can book in any work that needs to be completed. IT
changes are the biggest source of problems at the start of a new term.
Disruptors include:

   - A change of MIS provider
   - A change of ePayment provider
   - Switch, Firewall, Network Config, Wireless and Smoothwall changes
   - IP address changes
   - Server migrations
   - TRUSTe license installations.

*3. Make Free School Meal changes as soon as schools break up.* Pushing out
price changes then means you’ll iron out issues early and be ready when
schools return. We can provide guidance on this if required.

*4. Get help with menu updates.* If you’re planning a full menu update,
then we can do this for you, providing additional peace of mind. Simply
tell us *before Friday 28 June* *2024 *so that we can provide a quote and
book this in.

*5. Check you have access to the school calendar in TRUSTe*. If not, please
get in touch ASAP so we can add this for you. It’s important to update your
School Holidays and ensure the system is on the correct date ready for the
new term.

*6. Check your Free Meal Allocation is correct.* This is either updated in
Account Types in TRUSTe or centrally by your council or catering group. If
you use ParentPay, ensure the school office has updated the allowance with
ParentPay too.

*7. Add your pre-admissions to the system.* This way you can capture
fingerprints on an induction day before their first day of school. Students
will first need to be entered into the school’s management information
system to show in Civica Cashless Catering.

*8. Power on your tills before you need them!* Make sure they are
operational and on the correct date. This can be done on any cleaning days
before students return.

*9. Take a copy of the backup* and store it away from the cashless server
to guard against ransomeware attacks.
*Get in touch*
<https://app.hello.civica.co.uk/e/er?s=3121&lid=14097&elqTrackId=D270977988511F00C166C0A54188DEC9&elq=8b9e90eec08d4ff6a9d02d335eaaa648&elqaid=12730&elqat=1>
Don’t risk the panic of a disrupted service. Watch our video guides now to
make sure all-important checks have been completed and that you know how to:

   - Log a support ticket
   - Update your school calendar
   - Manage September intakes
   - Manage network or 3rd party IT changes
   - Retrieve online payments
   - Update menus, products, prices and FSM amounts.

*Improving the way we support you*

   - Ensuring we get the right ticket to the right person to resolve your
   queries more efficiently.

,T20240626.0356,J Drive GDPR worries,"Hi,
 Carl had just asked for me to document a bit of the use of The J drive. I
think the problem we have is that this share is a historical share that was
set up for staff to share files with students. It is a read only drive so
students can only view and download documents. They can't append them. I
think because it is historical, some staff are unaware of its purpose and
have been using it as a ""staff share"", instead of a ""student share"". Not
realising that students can read and download whatever they put in there.
Staff should use K drive for such things.

The only time that students can view these files is when they are logged
onto a school PC, it isn't available on ipads or chromebooks. So, is
only really available now in computer science and DT when they are using
the laptops and possibly in music.

*Recommendations:*

   - I would recommend that the read only access for students is removed
   from J drive at least in the short term. I very rarely use it, Dave Lowe
   says they never use it and so I'm sure Dave Allen doesn't. All the stuff I
   want to share with the students can be done through google classroom. So, I
   feel it is redundant. Unless there is a use for it elsewhere. This would
   limit the chance of inappropriate data being read or shared by students.
   - I would also recommend staff in all departments do an audit on the
   contents there (and possibly K Drive), as there are historical photos of
   students and staff as well as documents that may break GDPR rules: that
   only relevant data should be stored for only as long as it is necessary and
   that permission has been given by the subjects to hold this data and that
   it only shared with people who need this data.

Sorry for the long email, but in my previous role this was taken very
seriously in case a subject access request was put in. If students can see
data and there is a possibility that they find data about siblings or
uncles and Aunts (some of the data goes back to 2012) and word gets out, we
could end up in trouble.
Thank you,
Tim.

,T20240626.0276,Re: Paperless access - URGENT,"Hi Vital

To add to Sally's email, if the problem at Poppleton Road isn't obvious,
please could Sally be given the same type of remote access to Paperless as
Leanne Muir has, by logging on via the Archbishop's website? Even if it is
just a temporary solution while you work out what the main problem is.

Please note that the Poppleton Road issue is different to the one at
Malton.  The internal link that is working for everyone else on the
Pathfinder network should work at Poppleton Road, but isn't.  Malton aren't
on the network so need to use the external ink which currently isn't
working for anyone (though opening the port will hopefully solve that).

Kind regards

(presenting to all) the other people can not hear it.

Can you help me with settings etc as it may be something I am doing wrong
but have checked my padlock settings in google meet and all microphones are
on and when I play the video I can hear it but when I start presenting to
others they cant hear it.

Many thanks

Kind regards,

Yr7 numbers could fluctuate? Do they have an expiry date? Or shall we hold
fire and wait until we see what the situation is in September?



I'd also like to buy the YARC package, plus an additional 10 pupil record

Could you give me an estimate?

Two of our teachers have experienced an issue with trying to access the
shared drive on the same laptop.  This has not been an issue in school only
when the teachers have been working from home.

They are not experiencing this issue with their own laptops so I think that
it must be something specific around the device, it is one of our newer
laptops and I wonder if one of the settings may need adjusting?

,T20240625.0241,Fwd: Remote agent,"Hi,

When you updated our systems in the Easter Holidays, we have lost
connection with our printers and they are now not able to send us out ink
automatically. They have sent us these instructions on how to reconnect the
printer to get the automatic deliveries back up and running, please can
this be looked into ASAP as we have run out of cyan ink, had to order it
and are now unable to print until this arrives.

thank you

Good afternoon



Our system shows that the remote agent connection is not working on the
printers for your consumables. The remote agent is used for you to receive
Inks and toners automatically. Please forward this email and attachment for
your IT department.



Please find instructions on how to reset the RA, the changes will be
activated 24 hours after it is done so we can check on our systems then. If
you require more guidance, please email softwaresupport@riso.co.uk



If it is still not working, then we will send out an engineer.





Kind regards

Hi Jess

We have set you up with a school email address - it is a gmail account, so you can access it either via the gmail app, or via https://mail.google.com/

Your account details are:

Miss Jessica Moses
Email: jmoses@copmanthorpeprimary.co.uk

It's a good idea to check your emails in a morning, as sometimes emails are sent out re. changes made to lunch duty/staff/events for the day, which you may need to be aware of.

Thank you!

Should you continue to receive the 'common password' message and are confident the password you are trying is adequate, please liaise with your internal IT team to confirm the following websites have been allowed within your centre network/firewalls:

*Your IT department must also ensure that traffic on ports 443 and 8443 are allowed for above URLs.

We would also advise checking you do not have any additional software installed on your computer/laptop that may be affecting your network/firewalls. For example; we have received a few responses from customers, reporting that their safeguarding software was affecting this process. Again, your internal IT Support team may be required to check this.

Once they have confirmed the above has been setup, please clear your cookies & cache and then try logging back into Edexcel Online (please note - until the above has been done, you will find that all passwords you attempt will be flagged as a common password, as the process requires both the URLs and ports configuring, for the check request to be successful).

,T20240625.0125,Moving of HR files,"You'll never guess?...

I started cutting files from L Drive to tidy it ready for James to move the files, then I found that when I cut and pasted the folders into One Drive it copied everything across.  Amazing!

So I have moved everything myself.

This does mean that there is no back up of files on L drive, so I presume that One drive is backed up etc.  There are a few files left on L drive, SLB , but I don't need them.

Thanks

Our Governance Advisor (Liz Wilson) has been having issues connecting to
AHS guest wifi when she comes on site and has been having to use her
personal hotspot.

Apparently CYC has a block which prevents her from being able to join our
wifi, so she has asked if she can log on to PMAT BYOD?

She will be in our office this Thursday between 2-6pm - please could you
come to the PMAT office on Thursday afternoon to support her getting
connected?

Thanks so much,
Mia

We are trying to solve a problem relating to uploading/downloading photos
from our ipads.

Currently, we need to download all photos onto our server and save them in
the correct format before they can be loaded up onto our website or our
Facebook stream.

Ideally, we would like to load directly from our ipads onto Google Drive so
that Lucy can access the photos directly. However, Lucy needs to download
the photos back onto her computer before uploading them onto the
website/Facebook.

please can you advise?

Dear Admin,

As our valued client, we realise that you rely on our services to keep your
print devices well-supplied and operational, and your print outgoings
transparent and accurate.

 We are sorry to inform you that, according to our systems, the Apogee
Remote Management Application (ARMA) is currently offline on the following
IT asset:


*Hostname: EBOR-TOC01 Host IP: 172.26.128.1*

To minimise any disruption to your business, and ensure the issue is
rectified as quickly as possible so that your service and billing are not
affected, we’ve identified a few simple ways you can help us restore your
connection:


   1. You have received this email because we have recorded you as the key
   IT contact for your organisation. If you are not the key IT contact, please
   email us at arma@apogeecorp.com to update your information.
   Alternatively, please message us on the client portal at
   https://customer.apogeecorp.com!


   2. Common issues can include *(1)* recent changes in firewall
   configuration, *(2)* the host server / PC being offline, and/or *(3) *the
   host server / PC being decommissioned unexpectedly. If any of these sound
   applicable, please notify us right away!


   3. If these scenarios do not sound applicable, it’s worth restarting the
   ARMA service anyway! This can be done with the following steps:




   - Open the Windows Start Menu and activate ‘EKM Insight DCA Console
   (Administrator Mode)’
   - Click ‘Stop Service’, then ‘Start Service’.
   - The console should now display four green ticks, as pictured below:


[image: cid:image001.jpg@01DAAAD9.E17669B0]

If four green ticks are not displayed and the service does not restart,
please collect all of the Software Log Files found at:* C:\Program Files
(x86)\i2emfw\log*, then reply to this email *with the log files attached.*
A member of our support team will assist immediately.

 We apologise again for this disruption and look forward to resuming your
managed service as soon as we can.

Kind regards,
ARMA Technical Support

Helen mentioned that she has one in her office ready to use and they also have one in a classroom that is due to be replaced with a board in the very near future. So, you have the choice to swap the projector from the class room or the one in Helens office, she has said she would prefer you to go down on Friday.

to me

Hi

I am hoping you can help me but I realise this is a difficult task. On Friday a student hid something, we think in a loose ceiling tile near 303 or 301.

She is not wearing uniform so should be easy to spot. I am afraid I don't know what time she would have hid them. If you are able to identify the hiding place I would be very very grateful! It is a Y10 student and she has long dark hair. She rarely wears uniform.

We;ve just received delivery of our new visualisers in maths.
I don't want to mess things up by trying to install myself and am not even
sure if it needs any software downloaded (though I have added them to the
Google Sheet just in case).

The online manual is https://www.ipevo.com/support/qa/V4K

I have all the visualisers in the maths office at the moment but ideally,
we want them in each maths classroom and in a couple of offices too...

If anyone could come and have a look and advise on how best to install,
that would be great,.

Good morning

I have been trying to allocate an invoice line to code 835215 but Paperless

many times previously.

Kind regards

,T20240624.0030,Re: FMS - Ticket Update [ID:2419167],"Hi,


Has the below been looked into?


Hi,


I have been on with Caroline machine but we are getting some issues. Can you assist with installing the latest version of .net framework as this is required for FMS and may be causing an issue. We tried to install but was unable to.


When we try to run the SIMSInfrastructureSetup and select the FMS option we get an error saying that OCSetup is missing. We are hoping its linked to .net not being installed but this may need to be looked at as we dont normally get this error.


Also the device is unable to look at the server even if we try to access it through file explorer. This may be an issue later if we get FMS running as it wont be able to speak to the database.

Please reply to this e-mail to respond.


Thank you.

,T20240624.0029,Re: FMS - Ticket Update [ID:2419167],"Hi,


Has the below been looked into?


Hi,


I have been on with Caroline machine but we are getting some issues. Can you assist with installing the latest version of .net framework as this is required for FMS and may be causing an issue. We tried to install but was unable to.


When we try to run the SIMSInfrastructureSetup and select the FMS option we get an error saying that OCSetup is missing. We are hoping its linked to .net not being installed but this may need to be looked at as we dont normally get this error.


Also the device is unable to look at the server even if we try to access it through file explorer. This may be an issue later if we get FMS running as it wont be able to speak to the database.

Please reply to this e-mail to respond.


Thank you.

Would it be possible to unblock access to the confide system so every
member of staff can access the system. All staff will eventually be given
profiles on the system and they would need to access and use the product
differently depending on their level of access.

The page i tried to access:

,T20240621.0175,Faulty Telephone,"Good afternoon,

I spoke with Holly yesterday regarding our telephone being temperamental.

I told her that it had been fine since Rebecca had reported the fault.
Typically after I have said that it has started doing it again.

I answer a call, put them on hold and call another extension, I tell them
who is on the line and put the receiver down to transfer.  Something I have
always done.

Its not every time but it has been a lot today, when I put the receiver
down it says transfer has failed.  if you pick up the receiver you cannot
retrieve the call back, you have to do this by going back to the call using
the voicemail option and then picking up the receiver.

I hope you understand what I mean but any problems please let me know.

Thank you.

Luminate Education Group has been awarded the External Safeguarding Audits
contract by HSLT. They are also a google workspace organization.

They have created some files for our schools on their drives.

   - Our schools can access and populate the drives with HSLT files and
   documents, however, Rebecca Riley ( Rebecca.Riley@luminate.ac.uk ) who
   is the external auditor, is unable to see any of the files that are put
   into the folders.
   - However, I can see all of the files that HSLT schools have been
   populating the folders with.


Please can we resolve this access ASAP as the auditor will need to review
the evidence prior to carrying out her audits on our schools next week.

Hi Adrian,

We just need a small stand alone printer for the office.  We can't print
labels on the Riso so our office one usually gets used for that and then
for any small printing jobs if the Riso is being used.  I didn't ask them
about the  print release cards but we did have them for the Riso, however
when Vital did the transfer over to Pathfinder they took them off and they
aren't used at the moment.  We do still have some cards for it though.

We are happy to go with ABS if their contract is comparable if that is
better for the trust.

Thanks
Sally

Hi Tim,

Hope you are well. Apologies if I am repeating information you already
know… Gail has asked me to contact you re comms.

Sarah Taylor and I have met with our SLT to explain our roles for
September. We are now in a position to draft some communication for the
staff force and then onto parents to share our shared role.

From 1st September, Sarah and I will be Co-Headteachers, my working days
will be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Sarah Taylor will be leading the school
as Headtecaher Thursday, Friday.

Sarah will continue as Assistant Headteacher M-W.

We are both very excited to develop this new way of working whilst
continuing the shared vision and development of the school as I return from
maternity leave.

We also require a new email address setting up, which might be helpful to
share on the email. I think we discussed it being
headteacherhmo@ebor.academy
Sarah and I will have access to this but I will be responsible for this
over the summer.

I’m not sure who is responsible for this but we will need the
headteacherhmo@ebor.academy email to be linked to the software for HR and
recruitment so we both can access it over July and August.

Sarah, is there anything I’ve forgotten to mention?

Tim, please check the official title with Gail re
‘Co-Headship/Co-Headteacher’ and also the email address.

Many thanks, Olivia

,T20240621.0049,Y13 key dates for calendar 2024 25,"Hi Martyn

I have put Y13 mocks into the calendar for 24-28th Feb. This is the week after half term. The data deadline would be 14th March. Is that ok for you?
Currently, there is one set of mocks on the calendar. Is that what you want? If not, are you able to speak to Louise about logistics for when another set could happen? The Y13 Parents Eve is in for 20th January- the idea would be teachers can speak to students and parents about mock preparation and what they need to do better to up their game in the mocks. Does that seem ok? Parents Eve is harder to move as meetings are so tight.

Could you let me know of any other key dates you have already- other 6th form events should be in the calendar, but I could do with you checking them. James, could you give Martyn access to the new calendar if he doesn't already.

Thanks so much
Katie

To protect our colleagues' wellbeing, there is no expectation to check email or reply outside of 8am-4pm on working days. To allow flexible working for some colleagues, please allow two working days for a reply. If something is urgent, or safeguarding related, please telephone the school.

I work in school Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. I may reply to emails on an evening or weekend as is convenient to me, please do not feel obliged to reply outside of work hours.

Subject: Chris Pollard

Chris starts with us in September as Teacher of Computer Science.

He is attending the staff training day next Friday (28th) and requires email and access to the school IT systems.

He has completed all recruitment requirements, is safeguarding cleared and Matt is happy for him to have access to systems from next week.

I have therefore put his SIMs start date as 26/06/24 to allow time for everything to be generated before Friday.

Sarah - do you need SIMs and Classcharts log-ins at this time?  Please can you confirm to Claire.

Many thanks all,

Susan

 Hi Helen,

Twitter and Seesaw don't work on either iPad.

Neither Ipad can receive emails on gmail.

On this Ipad I also can't select a photo and email it. It is also saving the photos not as a jpeg but as a HEIC file which means it the photos won't go onto things like slides when I plug the Ipad in.

RWS-DFEiPad-09

IP Address 10.10.71.146

The other Ipad is RWS-DFEiPad-01

IP Address 10.10.69.194

Thank you,

Ellie

>> Debbie, as one of the UK’s leading cashless catering providers, we know

>> school in late August and early September.
>> Between the end of summer term and the start of the autumn term our
>> Cashless support team will be looking to dial into as many schools as
>> possible to perform health checks for the new term.  When contacted please
>> respond and confirm a date when access can be arranged.
>> *Here are our top tips to avoid common Cashless pitfalls:*
>> *1. Act now!* Almost all problems are avoidable with a bit of planning
>> and we’re here to help. Don’t risk a disrupted lunch service when schools
>> return.
>>
>> *2. Check if any IT changes are planned *and *tell us before Friday 28
>> June 2024 *so that we can book in any work that needs to be completed.
>> IT changes are the biggest source of problems at the start of a new term.
>> Disruptors include:
>>
>>    - A change of MIS provider
>>    - A change of ePayment provider
>>    - Switch, Firewall, Network Config, Wireless and Smoothwall changes
>>    - IP address changes
>>    - Server migrations
>>    - TRUSTe license installations.
>>
>> *3. Make Free School Meal changes as soon as schools break up.* Pushing
>> out price changes then means you’ll iron out issues early and be ready when
>> schools return. We can provide guidance on this if required.
>>
>> *4. Get help with menu updates.* If you’re planning a full menu update,
>> then we can do this for you, providing additional peace of mind. Simply
>> tell us *before Friday 28 June* *2024 *so that we can provide a quote
>> and book this in.
>>
>> *5. Check you have access to the school calendar in TRUSTe*. If not,
>> please get in touch ASAP so we can add this for you. It’s important to
>> update your School Holidays and ensure the system is on the correct date
>> ready for the new term.
>>
>> *6. Check your Free Meal Allocation is correct.* This is either updated
>> in Account Types in TRUSTe or centrally by your council or catering group.
>> If you use ParentPay, ensure the school office has updated the allowance
>> with ParentPay too.
>>
>> *7. Add your pre-admissions to the system.* This way you can capture
>> fingerprints on an induction day before their first day of school. Students
>> will first need to be entered into the school’s management information
>> system to show in Civica Cashless Catering.
>>
>> *8. Power on your tills before you need them!* Make sure they are
>> operational and on the correct date. This can be done on any cleaning days
>> before students return.
>>
>> *9. Take a copy of the backup* and store it away from the cashless
>> server to guard against ransomeware attacks.
>> *Get in touch*

Good morning Vital IT,

Did you manage to RDP to the InVentry system?

If you can access the InVentry system, can you please run through the instructions below?


1. _**On the sign in screen, triple click on the InVentry Logo on your home screen - this is usually in the bottom left of the screen**_
2. _**When the keypad appears enter the first 4 digits of your Anywhere ID (0632) or 1234**_
3. _**From the options that appear please select 'Shutdown InVentry', you will then see a normal PC desktop**_
4. _**An orange box will appear in the bottom right corner, please tap this then press 'Ok' in the window that appears in the centre of the screen (if you miss this the sign in screen will reload and you will need to complete the first 3 steps again)**_
5. _**If you can then double tap the TeamViewer icon  on the desktop**_
6. _**This should then open the TeamViewer application and provide you with an ID and a password. If you can please send these to us and leave the TeamViewer software open.**_
7. _**To reload the sign in software double tap the 'InVentry Core' icon on the desktop**_

Kind regards,
Brett.

Hi Matt,

Thank you for your time.

I tried to remote onto your unit, but as per the error message received, it seems like either the unit is offline or the TeamViewer credentials that we have for your site are outdated. So, if you could please make sure that the unit is online and provide us with the updated TeamViewer credentials:




1. _**On the sign in screen, triple click on the InVentry Logo on your home screen - this is usually in the bottom left of the screen**_
2. _**When the keypad appears enter your PIN: ""1234"" or ""0632"".**_
3. _**From the options that appear please select 'Shutdown InVentry', you will then see a normal PC desktop**_
4. _**An orange box will appear in the bottom right corner, please tap this then press 'Ok' in the window that appears in the centre of the screen (if you miss this the sign in screen will reload and you will need to complete the first 3 steps again)**_
5. _**If you can then double tap the TeamViewer icon  on the desktop**_
6. _**This should then open the TeamViewer application and provide you with an ID and a password. If you can please send these to us and leave the TeamViewer software open.**_
7. _**To reload the sign in software double tap the 'InVentry Core' icon on the desktop**_

We will be waiting for your response.

Kind regards,

Sachin Gupta

Hi Ben (Vital IT),

Just wondering if you managed to RDP to the InVentry system at Tang Hall Primary School - YO31 0UT.

I have attempted to connect using TeamViewer this morning but still failing to connect stating the application is not running on the device.

Kind regards,
Brett.

I have tried to follow the instructions given for TeamViewer unfortunately I cannot get past number 3 in the instructions as when I press Shutdown Inventry it turns the full screen off , it goes black with no power. A normal pc desktop does not appear unless I turn it back on then there is no orange box.

Thank you

Hi Matt,

Thank you for your time.

I tried to remote onto your unit, but as per the error message received, it seems like either the unit is offline or the TeamViewer credentials that we have for your site are outdated. So, if you could please make sure that the unit is online and provide us with the updated TeamViewer credentials:




1. _**On the sign in screen, triple click on the InVentry Logo on your home screen - this is usually in the bottom left of the screen**_
2. _**When the keypad appears enter your PIN: ""1234"" or ""0632"".**_
3. _**From the options that appear please select 'Shutdown InVentry', you will then see a normal PC desktop**_
4. _**An orange box will appear in the bottom right corner, please tap this then press 'Ok' in the window that appears in the centre of the screen (if you miss this the sign in screen will reload and you will need to complete the first 3 steps again)**_
5. _**If you can then double tap the TeamViewer icon  on the desktop**_
6. _**This should then open the TeamViewer application and provide you with an ID and a password. If you can please send these to us and leave the TeamViewer software open.**_
7. _**To reload the sign in software double tap the 'InVentry Core' icon on the desktop**_

We will be waiting for your response.

Kind regards,

Sachin Gupta

Hello Angela,

I will connect to your InVentry system shortly to assist with ticket 624375.

During this process, we will attempt to blank the screen out, as this may contain personal information. However, we would appreciate if you could take some precautions in case the connection drops, exposing the screen's display. This can be done by turning screen around or covering the display.

We will contact you when we have finished on your system with an update.

Can you please have a look at the PC connection in F2. The PC does not
connect to the internet automatically. Even if I tick the box, nothing  is
happening. If I untick the  'connect automatically' box and click connect,
it will connect.

However, this is taking  quite some time to connect and then I  can log
in. This is really not helpful when I am switching  rooms and PC's.

Thank you

Websites that contain actual games can be blocked, but not every website and image with the word 'game' in it or names of games.

My A-Level students research and create a computer game as part of their 3 month project and cannot complete their assessment. Also KS3 students cannot complete their unit 6 work. As well as some other lessons. So this would need to be a permanent unblock and not just temporary. 

please can I have some of your time to support with this.

[image: image (1).png]
Do you have any idea what could be causing this? I haven't heard of this
problem from any of our other authorisers so I don't know if this is a
problem with iTrent or at the school.

soon researching and creating a game. These need unblocking or they will
not be able to do their A-Level assessment.

A possibility would be to block websites where they can play games, but
websites that are about games or have the word 'game' in them are unblocked.

I have been tasked by ESS to log on a spreadsheet every detail of an issue,
date time, etc, for you (IT) to review before they are prepared to get

Hannah,
Although I appreciate ESS' stance. I am disappointed in their advance
notice of lack of support without a list of hurdles jumped first.
If we could please give notice to cancel our contract with them, and set up
a change in our support supplier as soon as possible, I would be
much obliged.

We are currently having an issue with one of our phone lines. When we try
to connect to the line CO2 the line is dead, but CO1 and CO2 are working.
We had a parent last night telling us she was continually trying to call
school and no one was answering. She called in front of us to show us and
neither phone rang.

Are you the correct people to report this to?

Hi Ben (Vital IT),

Just wondering if you managed to RDP to the InVentry system at Tang Hall Primary School - YO31 0UT.

I have attempted to connect using TeamViewer this morning but still failing to connect stating the application is not running on the device.

Kind regards,
Brett.

Good morning Angela,

We pre-install Teamviewer on all systems, so it should be installed, unless for some unknown reason your IT removed this program.

Is it possible to get the contact number/email for your IT support, please?

Kind regards,
Brett.

Hi Angela,

That's very strange, the system should then display the standard desktop.

If possible, can you attempt this process again today?

Good afternoon

I have tried to follow the instructions given for TeamViewer unfortunately I cannot get past number 3 in the instructions as when I press Shutdown Inventry it turns the full screen off , it goes black with no power. A normal pc desktop does not appear unless I turn it back on then there is no orange box.

Thank you

Angie.

Sachin Gupta, Jun 12, 2024, 18:34 GMT+1

Hi Matt,

Thank you for your time.

I tried to remote onto your unit, but as per the error message received, it seems like either the unit is offline or the TeamViewer credentials that we have for your site are outdated. So, if you could please make sure that the unit is online and provide us with the updated TeamViewer credentials:




1. _**On the sign in screen, triple click on the InVentry Logo on your home screen - this is usually in the bottom left of the screen**_
2. _**When the keypad appears enter your PIN: ""1234"" or ""0632"".**_
3. _**From the options that appear please select 'Shutdown InVentry', you will then see a normal PC desktop**_
4. _**An orange box will appear in the bottom right corner, please tap this then press 'Ok' in the window that appears in the centre of the screen (if you miss this the sign in screen will reload and you will need to complete the first 3 steps again)**_
5. _**If you can then double tap the TeamViewer icon  on the desktop**_
6. _**This should then open the TeamViewer application and provide you with an ID and a password. If you can please send these to us and leave the TeamViewer software open.**_
7. _**To reload the sign in software double tap the 'InVentry Core' icon on the desktop**_

We will be waiting for your response.

Kind regards,

Sachin Gupta

Hello Angela,

I will connect to your InVentry system shortly to assist with ticket 624375.

During this process, we will attempt to blank the screen out, as this may contain personal information. However, we would appreciate if you could take some precautions in case the connection drops, exposing the screen's display. This can be done by turning screen around or covering the display.

We will contact you when we have finished on your system with an update.

Kind regards

Good afternoon Caroline,



Im just sending an email through following the call we had yesterday (the issue with opening up an excel file that is being sent via Email)



I have spoke with another team and they have suggested it may be the version of excel on the device you are using it may not be the newest version which may be the reason you are unable to open it but your colleague can.

I have been advised the best contact would be the local IT as they will be able to check the version and have a deeper look as it sounds like it is the device not the email.



If you have any further questions please let me know



Kind regards,



       Georgia Vary

Amit Waghole, Jun 18, 2024, 11:34 GMT+1

Hello Stephen,

Thank you for your query regarding upgrading Windows on your InVentry system from Windows 7 to Windows 10.

We at InVentry are unable to upgrade the Windows version for you as we do not hold license keys to conduct this process. The InVentry system however is the schools property and you are able to use the schools Windows license key to complete the upgrade.

We must stress the importance that the upgrade process is conducted manually as the use of an image will remove all InVentry software (including the database) from the system. We are unable to image the systems remotely so unfortunately our only option, should this happen, is to arrange for a new hard drive to be fitted and this will incur a fee for the site visit.

Online Instructions on how to complete this process including a checklist of key points are available on our support portal via the link below :

https://inventry.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004824977

I have provided the Windows administrator credentials verbally via telephone.

Once you have completed the upgrade of the Windows client you will then need to contact the InVentry Support team so that we can ensure the system is running correctly.

If you do have any further queries regarding this please let us know.

Kind regards

Amit Waghole

Note New Ticket Note:

Note Description:
Hi, 

We have sent an engineer to site to confirm the devices connection to the network, we have ensured it has the correct IP address, marked the device as a staff device to it gets the correct filtering rules, ensured that TeamViewer access is available through the smooth wall. We have also removed any proxies that were previously configured by CYC, we noticed that the CYC proxy was still configured in the Inventry remote anywhere software but we dont have the ability to change that. 

We are unsure where to go form here so is there anything else you can suggest to check? 

We did notice that the device was running windows 7, could it just be outdated?

Thanks
Ben

Hi Ben (Vital IT),

Just wondering if you managed to RDP to the InVentry system at Tang Hall Primary School - YO31 0UT.

I have attempted to connect using TeamViewer this morning but still failing to connect stating the application is not running on the device.

Kind regards,
Brett.

Good morning Angela,

We pre-install Teamviewer on all systems, so it should be installed, unless for some unknown reason your IT removed this program.

Is it possible to get the contact number/email for your IT support, please?

That's very strange, the system should then display the standard desktop.

I've just turned the projector on in 106 and attached is what the
screen looks like.
This is rather unusable as it's making a lot of the screen

It was not like this on Friday, although it was not great, and I have
personally not used it until now.
The picture attached is not quite showing the full extent of this, there
are also some circles displaying.

Hi,

I’m not sure if I have forwarded this email to the correct people -
apologies if not.

As per the email below, Emily has restated her iPad today and unfortunately
smoothwall has not been removed from her iPad.  She is in school all day
tomorrow as she has a further maths revision session (period 3).  Would it
please be possible for someone to take a look at her updated at anytime
tomorrow while she is in school (though preferably not during session 3)?

Many thanks
Claire

Hi Ben (Vital IT),

Just wondering if you managed to RDP to the InVentry system at Tang Hall Primary School - YO31 0UT.

I have attempted to connect using TeamViewer this morning but still failing to connect stating the application is not running on the device.

Kind regards,
Brett.

We pre-install Teamviewer on all systems, so it should be installed, unless for some unknown reason your IT removed this program.

Is it possible to get the contact number/email for your IT support, please?

I have tried to follow the instructions given for TeamViewer unfortunately I cannot get past number 3 in the instructions as when I press Shutdown Inventry it turns the full screen off , it goes black with no power. A normal pc desktop does not appear unless I turn it back on then there is no orange box.

Thank you

Angie.

Hi Matt,

Thank you for your time.

I tried to remote onto your unit, but as per the error message received, it seems like either the unit is offline or the TeamViewer credentials that we have for your site are outdated. So, if you could please make sure that the unit is online and provide us with the updated TeamViewer credentials:




1. _**On the sign in screen, triple click on the InVentry Logo on your home screen - this is usually in the bottom left of the screen**_
2. _**When the keypad appears enter your PIN: ""1234"" or ""0632"".**_
3. _**From the options that appear please select 'Shutdown InVentry', you will then see a normal PC desktop**_
4. _**An orange box will appear in the bottom right corner, please tap this then press 'Ok' in the window that appears in the centre of the screen (if you miss this the sign in screen will reload and you will need to complete the first 3 steps again)**_
5. _**If you can then double tap the TeamViewer icon  on the desktop**_
6. _**This should then open the TeamViewer application and provide you with an ID and a password. If you can please send these to us and leave the TeamViewer software open.**_
7. _**To reload the sign in software double tap the 'InVentry Core' icon on the desktop**_

We will be waiting for your response.

Kind regards,

Sachin Gupta

Hello Angela,

I will connect to your InVentry system shortly to assist with ticket 624375.

During this process, we will attempt to blank the screen out, as this may contain personal information. However, we would appreciate if you could take some precautions in case the connection drops, exposing the screen's display. This can be done by turning screen around or covering the display.

We will contact you when we have finished on your system with an update.

Kind regards

Dear Catherine,

Barclays LifeSkills
<https://click.emails.barclays.co.uk/?qs=f68c40ad0a8e9a3ed73cdf2edbc9c997c70d3abccdb04a8603f4a0c8bb2a29e3d2b1abc8488381ca4668690d6fc8024800d998123a8e1e23259a5329ec781c32>
has the tools and resources to help support you and your students in
developing the skills they need for their future careers.

Next month, our incredibly popular *online work experience programme*
returns, which starts on *1 July.* This is the perfect opportunity for
students to gain insight into a range of job roles and understand what
skills are used within a bank. The programme is not limited to those
thinking about a career in financial services as the knowledge and skills
students will learn can be transferred to other industries. Students will
have until *28 June* to sign up.

In addition to the online work experience programme, we have a range of
curriculum-linked resources you can work through with your students to
support them to enter the world of work with confidence. Below, you will
find tools like our CV Builder, which your students can use to develop a
strong CV, or the Virtual Work Experience tool, which allows them to build
upon their workplace skills.

Login today to access all our resources.

Help provide your students (14-19) with the knowledge and skills they need
to develop career aspirations with the Barclays LifeSkills online work
experience programme *starting on Monday, 1 July.* They will gain insight
into what it is like working at a bank, have the chance to hear from
Barclays employees, and build core transferable skills they can take into
any career or industry. The programme takes place after school and includes
five live webinars, activities to test and deepen their learning, and the
opportunity to complete a project.

The *deadline to register is 28 June.* The programme is free to join, but
students will need their own technology to take part.

allowing students to learn about the different departments of a company,
where they will meet various people and help them to solve problems and
complete tasks.

I have tried syncing via Wonde again but it is still not pulling through

There seems to be a problem with the Chromebook in the fitness suite. We
use it to screencast but unfortunately, there is damage to the cable and I
also think the USB port is damaged. The screen won't cast properly and when
it does, it will disconnect.

Dear Vanessa,

Thank you for your time during your case resolution. Your incident number
00376471: Unable to submit reports using PS Gateway, has now been resolved,
and we have included below the resolution steps.

Good Afternoon,


This afternoon I have been communicating with a member of the development
team, he has said that the error that is appearing will be due to proxy
issues as it is a recent change/error after no changes.


Please can you ask your IT support to go to the proxy setting:allow access
to the url / application allowed to talk to the internet.


Please let us know how you get on with this and if you require any further
support.


Kindest Regards

,T20240617.0174,Re: FMS - Ticket Update [ID:2419167],"Hi,


I have been on with Caroline machine but we are getting some issues. Can you assist with installing the latest version of .net framework as this is required for FMS and may be causing an issue. We tried to install but was unable to.


When we try to run the SIMSInfrastructureSetup and select the FMS option we get an error saying that OCSetup is missing. We are hoping its linked to .net not being installed but this may need to be looked at as we dont normally get this error.


Also the device is unable to look at the server even if we try to access it through file explorer. This may be an issue later if we get FMS running as it wont be able to speak to the database.

Please reply to this e-mail to respond.


Thank you.

Hi Carl,

Tried the printer last night having had a request for printing, however the
software installed looks to start the print process, but then looks to get
stuck in processing the job, so doesn't print.
I've looked on the HP forum to see any solutions and information relating
to drivers for this printer, but this seems to be a common issue. This is
the link to the page I was looking at
https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/swdetails/hp-designjet-800-printer-series/25302/swItemId/pl-112185-1

If you get a milli-second and it looks okay can you try this?

Thanks for the great support last week, Dave

loose powder is picked up by paper and put into the machine so I don't know

Please can someone come out to look at some of my laptops and the charging cabinet.

Laptop 1 and Laptop 5 won't charge even though they are in a different charging space.

Laptop 8 has no sound - might be the update as others have had the same issue.

Thank you

,T20240617.0032,Printers at Tang Hall,"Good morning,

We are having problems with the printers here since the new office printer
was installed. We're having problems connecting to the original printer in
our PPA room (as you can see from my screenshot below, it says that they're
'not connected' to my laptop) and lots of people have said that work they
sent from home over the weekend to print is just not there in their print
queue, which is very frustrating and time consuming this morning.

Please could you advise or send someone down to sort ASAP as it is causing
chaos amongst the staff this morning as they are all trying to print their
work for today.

,T20240617.0031,Maths.co.uk,"Hi,

We subscribe to the website www.maths.co.uk and over the last few weeks we
have had issues with parts of the website being accessed by the children.

When I've contacted them about it, they've suggested that it may be a
'blocking' issue - something they've had to deal with recently with other
schools.

Is there a way to check if any filters are in place for this website when
the children access it?

thanks

Simon

,T20240616.0037,Library management system,"Hi Leon,

You asked on Friday that staff let you know of any software that they
currently run on their PC in classrooms etc.

The library software 'Accessit Library ' is only installed on one machine
in the school and that is the computer on my desk in the library.

I also have access to reset student passwords, Google and PC, I don't know
if you need that information as well.

As of Monday morning I will be splitting my time between Warren's office
and the library as I take over from Kathi so if you need to access the
library computer can you let me know so I can work around this.

thanks

,T20240614.0128,Projector/Connection point in S4,"Hi,

The projector in S4 (or the connection point) does not seem to be working
well. One of the computer channels on the wall socket using the VGA cable
is pretty heavily red tinted, and the other computer channel on the wall
socket using the VGA cable is pretty heavily yellow tinted. I've tried
adjusting the colour channels on the projector itself but they don't scale
far enough to counteract this, and as far as I can tell the VGA cable
doesn't have any bent pins. The HDMI cable in the wall socket doesn't seem
to work at all either.

Hi Claire


Once the patches have been authorised to the school's Solus I will let you know.  Below are the instructions for your IT.



Patches 19098 and 20249. These will grant execute permissions to all SIMS objects. As these Patches are a database install procedure and will grant execute permissions to all SIMS objects, they must be applied using the SQL System Administrator credentials when all users are logged out of SIMS.net.


Patch 19098 will need to be applied first, and Patch 20249 will need to be applied second. Extract the zip files and apply the Patches against the SIMS database. With all Patches, it is important to apply these at a quiet time and once a backup has been taken of the SIMS database.

If the Patches do not resolve the issue, then you will need to reattach the SIMS database. Log into dBattach and detach the SIMS database.
Cut the SIMS MDF and SIMS LDF out of the SQL DATA folder (e.g. C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL12.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA) to the server desktop.
Log back into dBattach and attach the cut SIMS MDF.

Please reply to this e-mail to respond.


Thank you.

Hello Giles

Vital has set up a contracts@hslt.academy<mailto:contracts@hslt.academy> email address for several staff and one of our Trustees for contracts and docusign.  This has presented a problem with 'We Transfer' documents on the filtering system.

I have sent the screen shot to Vital after speaking with them.  Will this cause a problem when Nathan sends the docusign?.  I spoke to Jimmy and he said that if logged in elsewhere we should be able to access the documents.  I am presuming that Andy Simpkin, our Trustee will be able to access the documents when needed.

The contracts@hslt.academy<mailto:contracts@hslt.academy> needs to have access to information from Gate and Bar.

Susan Goff has an issue with her MFA App / Gmail.  There are two accounts
on her MFA App showing as Ebor and Ebor Academy.  The Ebor one is not
signed in.

The MFA app doesn't seem to be linking with her Gmail's as when signing in
it asks for sign in information and the code from the app but no code is
available and repeatedly asks for sign in details.

Does her MFA settings need resetting/removing to add her account from
scratch?

Kind regards

Hi Caroline.


We don't want to install in separately as then you will get issues each time their is an update. I am trying to get it set up through solus so that once you have it installed you will get future updates.


I need vital to look at why your machine and the server wont speak with each other as seen below.



Please reply to this e-mail to respond.

 We have received an alert in Crowdstrike regarding suspicious script launched that might be related to malicious activity.
 
 It appears that the username logged at the time of the detection on the ""ASA-SD-303-11"" has tried to download a powershell script, that is a modified Rick Roll ASCII Troll for Powershell.

 Please verify this activity with the user and whether or not they are authorized to execute such scripts. However, given that powershell scripts can be executed on the system in question is a security issue in itself as the student can potentially download malicious scripts and run them on the endpoint, and as such we advise you to restrict powershell access to only permitted users.

,T20240613.0174,Re: Studybugs - Lost Connection - New MIS,"Hi,

Unfortunately as you have changed MIS the connection with Studybugs has
been broken, this means you are not sharing attendance with York Council at
present.

To start a new connection with SIMS is very easy, and my colleague Lee sent
across instructions on his last emails.

Is there a new IT contact whom we should contact to resolve the connection
issue? Perhaps the Trust's IT person?

We look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

Leyla

Hi ​there,

Did you get a chance to read my message below? We lost connection with
Poppleton Ousebank Primary School on the 15th of January and have not been
able to share live attendance data with York council ever since. It would
be great if this could be resolved today. This process typically takes no
longer than 5 minutes to complete.

*If you have an IT team that you'd prefer we contact directly, please let
me know their name and email address.*

Now that you've been fully migrated over from RM Integris to SIMS, you can
connect Studybugs to your SIMS account here
https://studybugs.com/schools/27743/help/studybugssync/sims. Once you've
made the connection, we'll fetch the latest data from SIMS and then migrate
the data in Studybugs accordingly.

In order to view the link above, you will need to be signed in to your
Studybugs account. I can see you already have one set up. If needed, you

I hope this helps and let me know how it goes.

Following on from my earlier emails, the first pic above is what I saw on my laptop when I tried to log in at home last night.

I brought the laptop in today and it was still showing that initially before syncing.

But then interestingly, it switched to the second screenshot as it synced. Is the red cross through scans significant?

I really need this sorting as I work from home a lot and need to be able to access documents.

Subject: Calendar 2024.25



Hi Both



As discussed today I have transferred information from 2023.24 to next year's calendar (draft attached). Clearly things might move/change but it's a good starting point.



I haven't included the trips or work experience etc.



It didn't take as long as I thought it would.



Feel free to print and scribble over the attached calendar and I can make any necessary changes.



Many thanks

I have a bit of a problem that I wonder if you can help me with please? One
of the art jobs is to take photos of the artwork and print them out so that
the kids can stick evidence of their work into their work books and then
take their pottery etc. home. I had some issues with this to begin with but
then my 4G kicked into action and I was able to upload them from my phone
easily. However, I've been trying to do this today and I'm having real
problems uploading the photos as I can't get onto my 4G as I usually do.
I've spoken to my line Manager who asked me to put a request in for IT
help. Is there a solution to this that you can think of?
Many thanks.
Keira.

Subject: MFL Chromebook trolley


Hi,



I’m afraid there’s been some damage to the front of our Chromebook trolley, and the panel in the middle is loose on the left-hand side. This means that the left-hand door can be opened even when “locked”. Lots of Year 11s have been allowed in and out to help themselves to Chromebooks over the last couple of weeks (as Mike specifically asked colleagues not to do…), so although this issue started a little while ago, it is now much worse.



I suspect it’s just a quick job to fix with a screw – is this something I just need to get a site supervisor to do, or would one of you prefer to come and look at it?



Thanks,

Sarah

We have had issues this week with systems not talking to each other for our new starters


  *
Student not pulling through to NRS from Sims - now resolved - James ran sync manually yesterday, but we need this to be automatic.
  *
Also need a login to be able to run the NRS/Sims sync manually if needed
  *
Biometric consent - not pulling through to NRS from Sims
  *
FSM's not pulling through to NRS from Sims
  *
Wisepay payment not pulling through from Wisepay to NRS
  *
Inventry did not update from Sims automatically, I have run this manually, but needs to be automatic
  *
Wisepay sync needs checking as not sure whether this had to be manually run to work too?

This needs addressing as we cant have a repeat of these issue for the next new starter or for September.

Thank you.

One of our Year 4 students (Alieu Trawally) is having difficulties with his
access to the websites used in class. When he logs in he is unable to
access websites such as Reading Plus or TT Rockstars that the other
students are logged into, the screen is white and nothing happens when you
press any keys and the mouse is unresponsive. In some instances he can log
in and get to the websites, but then when he tries to access the content
the screen starts buffering and freezes.

We've tried logging out completely and restarting the machines, this fixed
the issue for a few minutes, we have also tried several Chromebooks but
this hasn't helped.

Please could you assist?  The email address is 19AlieuT@bgp.hslt.academy

Hi Lesley

I've been having continuous issues with the Google Drive being down and not
loading, especially in the morning. It keeps telling me I'm offline when
other internet sites are working.

I've been waiting 20 minutes now to try and get into the cover drive.

Thanks

Nat

Hi Lesley

This internet is rubbish. I am stressed out with work I wanted to do this
morning. I know it’s not your fault but I’m stressing too about this
afternoons online construction exam. I have got some back up paper copies I
can use? Catherine what do you think? Wait and see it get ready to go paper
based?

Thanks

Denise

Hi Lesley,

I had very patchy internet during P1 which didn't make doing reading plus
with the Y7 nurture group very easy!

The computer in the Arc took 30 minutes to sign in then I had to do my
whole lesson using the visualiser because the network wasn't working.

Thanks,

Matt

best place for him.

To: Gareth Shaw <gshaw@ahs.pmat.academy>


When accessing a project on the canva website, it informs us that the
website is ""trying to reconnect"" and any edits that are made are not
properly saved. This has been an issue since the change in wifi and means
we are unable to complete any newspaper work in school. The website works
fine when not in school. Is there anything you can do to remedy this?

screen when turned on. Very occasionally it comes back to life for about 30
seconds then cuts out. He swapped out the HDMI cable but that hasn't solved
the problem. Sorry to keep asking about it but it's been affecting our
teaching and learning in here since before half term. x

,T20240612.0071,Geography Office Request,"Hi both,

I was wondering if it is at all possible to get more computers in the
Geography office, we currently have a team of 5 but only 2 computers.
I am planning on having a big clear out in the summer of the office and
would love it if we could have 3 ideally or 2 new computers (5 or 4 total,
which other departments have) this isn't just about work space but also to
allow the department to work more cohesively together for the progress of
geography students, as currently we are very separate from each other.
Any questions please let me know, love to know if this is possible.

John I've copied you in but I am planning on getting rid of at least two
shelves in the office to make more space so it is workable space (we may
need some more chairs if we get more computers also).

Many thanks,

Mary

,T20240612.0028,Blocked Site,"Hi,

I've gone to use ChatGPT this morning and found it blocked again. This is
what is presented:

[image: image.png]

I noticed that it is listing me as a 'default user', which was mentioned on
the phone yesterday when I contacted support about Amanda Benson's attempts
to access Zoom - she had the same message then.

I've tried Zoom this morning myself and also been blocked - so is this to
do with settings?

Also, I asked my colleague Georgina Sunley if she could access Zoom, to
verify if the error was more widespread and she could not, but the message
was different for her. I'll send that along later when she forwards it to
me, but there seems to be an issue with the classification of our logins,
based on what I was told over the phone yesterday.

Please can you help resolve this?

thanks,

Simon

,T20240611.0229,Re: IT3 & IT4 - projectors,"Thanks Emma - it's moe the projectors in these rooms that are the issue.

The boards aren't needed for modelling like they are in maths but the
projectors are very poor and are bleaching out the information.
If we can upgrade the projectors somehow that would be great.

The boards eventually would be good but certainly not needed at present.

In terms of our faulty as a whole, G5 is in far greater need in terms of
board!

But good news that we have secured 3 for the school so far :-)

Thank you for setting up my new computer etc. today!
Just wondering if you could add SIMS onto it as I can't find it when I
search for it in the start bar. I also usually have the symbol for SIMS at
the bottom of my desktop screen along the bar at the bottom if that's
possible too?

Also, maybe a silly question,  does the new computer have a DVD drive? It
looks like there is one but I'm not sure how to open it if it is...

Thank you!

,T20240611.0199,IT3 & IT4 - projectors,"Hi

I have just had a meeting with Martin Bell with regards to the teaching of
computing & Business.

As part of that meeting he has brought up the issue of the projectors in
IT3 and IT4 being particularly poor quality to the point that what he & Dan
Brown are trying to teach / deliver does not look the same to the students
as it does on the computer. The projectors are bleaching things out so much
that often things are disappearing to the students and they cannot see the
content.

Please can these 2 projectors be looked at to see if they can be improved /
replaced for September please?

Many thanks, Georgie

Hi Kate,

Regarding your recent request for KPAX installation for SN 9800793900, this
device has previously reported under EBOR Academy Trusts main server under
IP address 10.18.161.5, usually the reason it would stop reporting is if it
has had a new IP address allocated to it, would you be able to speak with
your IT and find out the new IP address then let me know and I'll add it to
the KPAX agent which should resolve the issue

Regards

Steve

Hi Lesley,

I know you are probably well aware of this already but I just wanted to
email you after your request in briefing the other week.

The internet P5 today has been so poor in Cayton Block. I currently have a
PPA and it has been almost impossible to do anything meaningful. Every time
I try to load something up, it either takes a really long time to load or
it times out.

I gave up on trying to do any planning and tried to do my printing for the
week instead. However, none of my printing is getting sent to the printer
when I press print.

Thanks,
Hollie

I'm working at home today and am missing a folder called Class Lists and a document with the details of Sept 24 new starters. They were in the U-Drive Marketing folder, probably in the Admissions sub-folder.

I've searched for both without success.

I'm wondering whether either my laptop here at home hasn't updated or it's been lost during the transfer process on Friday.

I hope you can help. I was in the new starters folder yesterday.

 Hello Giles. 
 I hope you're well! 
 According to our logs, we're not fetching new data from your MIS which indicates that the Wizkids SIMS connector installed on Hope Learning Trust's MIS server isn't running. We need the connector up and running as soon as possible in order to keep your Google environment up to date. 
 How to solve this: 
 1. Please connect to your MIS server. 
 2. Open Services 
 3. Find Service called ""Edulife Port Broker Service"" and restart it. 
 When this is done, please get back to us so we can confirm that we're pulling updated data. 
 If you're having trouble with any of the following steps, we're happy to help via TeamViewer. Please provide me with the TeamViewer details, and I'll connect. 
 Thank you in advance!

To the best of my knowledge, all Filey secondary accounts were closed (not
those for the nursery and primary school which we still own). However I
have been informed of a breach where an email has been sent to Mrs Baxter
<ibaxter@fs.ebor.academy>. She has received the email so I am guessing it
is either forwarded on to her new account or monitored on her phone.

Can we double check that all Filey accounts no longer have access to their
old emails or the drive

I thought I'd set up MFA a couple of months ago and I received a
confirmation email etc. However, I do not seem to be able to gain access to
view my payslip, and have been advised that MFA needs to be set up in a
school with the support of IT for it to work.

I work from home. My next visit to a school within working hours will be on
Tuesday 16 July (I have a meeting that starts at 12:45).  Would I be able
to arrange a time prior to my meeting for someone to support me through the
set up please? If you could let me know roughly how long the process takes,
I can speak to the school and arrange to arrive there earlier.

Many thanks

Please could you let us know if there are any plans to fix the issue of no
guest internet access at Burton Green Primary?  Today we had another member
of the Trust that was unable to work on site due to this.

As we are in an Ofsted window our Headteacher is very concerned because
when our inspection occurs there will be a lot of people from across the
Trust on site alongside the Ofsted inspectors.

Any update would be appreciated.

the internet dropping out.
Additionally I was on a Google Meet 9.20 - 10.27 with one other colleague
from the Trust. At 10.27 it dropped out and would not come back on due to
'unstable' internet and we had to resort to a phone call meeting.

Hi Adam,

Just emailing with an update on this - we have changed the workshop to a different Minecraft one and they have sent some information to pass on to you/the technicians to ensure some urls are whitelisted! Please forward on to the relevant person - I'm just sending to you as you seem to be involved from the beginning!



  1.
You mentioned there is Wifi available to connect to. Please keep in mind some URL's will need to be whitelisted before hand to ensure Minecraft can even connect whilst on the school premises. This is very IMPORTANT

In regards to Minecraft working on site Below is a list of all the URLs needed for Minecraft to fully function. I’ve highlighted the essential URLs (these are required for signing in – Minecraft will not operate without these). I have also identified the URLs required to access the built-in lessons. In an ideal world, it would be great to unblock all the URLs to allow full functionality (the immersive reader and coding features are very useful but not necessary for the game to work). If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Subject: Minecraft Workshop

Hi Adam,

I will be delivering a workshop at Park Grove Primary at some point in the near future, as part of this workshop I will need access to wifi for 17 laptops and the links within this website whitelisting please. https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4404784181524-URLs-Used-by-Minecraft-Education

To test all is working I have the following guidance:

I find the best way to test Minecraft is to find a machine with it already installed and login with a Microsoft account. As long as it gets past the login screen, we will be fine. Alternatively, you can download and install Minecraft Education for free vi this link >> Download | Minecraft Education<https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/get-started/download>.

Failing that, you can try the following URLs.

NOTE: If manually testing these sites (i.e., through a web browser such as Edge/Chrome), don't worry if the page is blank or you get an XML error, we are only concerned if you get a warning message saying that the website is blocked by your Internet Service Provider (e.g., for games etc.). Any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

,T20240611.0084,Unable to access internet at Burton Green,"Dear Vital

Today whilst at Burton Green, i was unable to get my laptop to access the
HSLT internet system. I tried to also use my phone as a local hub but alas
no joy whatsoever.

I am sure that this is not the first time HSLT colleagues have emailed
Vital about this issue.
Could some kind soul please keep me up to date with developments at BG as i
currently need to use their facilities much more over the upcoming weeks to
develop a new maths HSLT curriculum. Having access to the internet on my
laptop is crucial for this to be achieved, as i also need to be able to
access word and other microsoft packages which are currently on my laptop
but not on chromebooks etc.

To: Brian King <bking@ahs.pmat.academy>


Hi Brian,

Thanks for your email. We have been in touch with our support team
regarding this error message, as another school was experiencing the same
issue yesterday. They tried to reproduce the errors you are experiencing,
but it seems that this is an internal IT issue at your side, rather than an
error with the platform itself.

Are you able to speak with your IT Team, as they may be able to help with
the issue if this is due to an internal firewall/security feature blocking
the website.


If you are unable to fix the issue, we can send you the papers as a pdf by
email, but you will still need to resolve this issue in time for uploading
the completed papers to your account, so we would suggest you speak with
your IT Team first.


Best regards,

Team UKMT

We don't want to install in separately as then you will get issues each time their is an update. I am trying to get it set up through solus so that once you have it installed you will get future updates.


I need vital to look at why your machine and the server wont speak with each other as seen below.

,T20240611.0008,Re: HP designJet 800,"Hi Carl,

Tried the printer last night having had a request for printing, however the
software installed looks to start the print process, but then looks to get
stuck in processing the job, so doesn't print.
I've looked on the HP forum to see any solutions and information relating
to drivers for this printer, but this seems to be a common issue. This is
the link to the page I was looking at
https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/swdetails/hp-designjet-800-printer-series/25302/swItemId/pl-112185-1

If you get a milli-second and it looks okay can you try this?

Thanks for the great support last week, Dave

Digital - Microsoft 365
Office 365 A1 Plus for education will retire on August 1 2024

Office 365 A1 Plus is being retired by Microsoft to ensure schools have
compliant licensing plans, and to support the transition to cloud licences
Microsoft 365 A3 and Microsoft 365 A5. Microsoft Office 365 A1 Plus program
is an Office subscription that includes Office desktop apps for qualified
schools that purchased Office institution-wide for faculty and staff.

Previously any school who purchased an Open Value Subscription Education
Solutions (OVS-ES) annual volume licence agreement would get the Office 365
A1 Plus licence added to their Microsoft 365 Tenancy. Find out more here.
<https://nyes.info/Newsletter/ExternalLink/208501?source=newsletter&guid=04710F04-380B-4CBB-BFA0-2D6C2D6D7DEE>

If you have a Software and Infrastructure contract with NYES Digital, no
further action is required. The support team will check the licences for
you.

What happens if you don’t have the above contract?

Then…
If you’d like to check yourself, you can do this from the Microsoft 365
Admin Portal.

   1. Navigate to the M365 Admin Portal https://admin.microsoft.com
   <https://nyes.info/Newsletter/ExternalLink/208502?source=newsletter&guid=04710F04-380B-4CBB-BFA0-2D6C2D6D7DEE>
-
   Login as your school's Microsoft 365 Administrator.
   2. On the left-hand navigation menu, go to Billing > Licenses.
   3. Look for Office 365 A1 Plus for Faculty and Office 365 A1 Plus for
   Student assigned licenses.

You will be currently using one of the following:

*Office 365 A1*
Free online Office productivity and learning tools. Includes online web
versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Microsoft Teams, and
additional classroom tools.
*Office 365 A1 Plus *
Offers everything that comes with Office 365 A1 and also includes the full
desktop apps for Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook) not
just the online web versions.

*After all existing Office 365 A1 Plus licences expire on August 1st, 2024,
schools will have the choice to:*

1. If the school has an active Microsoft OVS-ES volume licence agreement,
which includes the Desktop apps:

   1. Anyone with an A1 Plus licence after August 1st will need to be moved
   to an Office 365 A1 licence, the Office 365 A1 licences are free to schools.
   2. Request Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise licences added to the
   school Tenancy. This will add licences for the full Office Desktop apps.
   3. Assign M365 Apps for Enterprise to staff and students who require
   licences for the full desktop Office applications.

2. If the school does not have a valid OVS-ES agreement, the school can
purchase Microsoft 365 Education Cloud Solution Provided (CSP) A3 and A5
licences.


Do you have an Software and Infrastructure Service Level Agreement with
NYES Digital?

*Yes and have an active OVS-ES:*

   - NYES Digital will move all your Office 365 A1 Plus licensed users to
   Office 365 A1
   - NYES Digital will add the Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise to your
   Microsoft 365 Tenancy
   - NYES Digital will assign the Microsoft 365 Apps to the schools users
   who previously had A1 Plus licences.

*Yes but do not have an active OVS-ES agreement:*

   - NYES Digital will move all your Office A1 Plus licensed users to
   Office A1
   - NYES Digital will provide a quote for Microsoft 365 A3 licences for
   your Faculty and Students.

Customers with a Software and Infrastructure Service level Agreement with
NYES Digital will not need to do anything. NYES Digital will move your
licenses for you and if you have volume license OVS-ES agreement we will
ensure that your staff are provided with the Microsoft 365 Apps.

*No, you are not yet a customer of NYES Digital *
Please contact - nyes.digital@northyorks.gov.uk
<https://nyes.info/Newsletter/ExternalLink/211053?source=newsletter&guid=04710F04-380B-4CBB-BFA0-2D6C2D6D7DEE>
and request a quote to manage your Microsoft 365 Tenancy, we will also be
able to provide you with Microsoft 365 A3 licences.

Should you have any questions or want to know more about the transition
process, please do not hesitate to contact our NYES Digital support team.

If you have a Software and Infrastructure contract with NYES Digital, no
further action is required. The support team will check the licences for
you.

What happens if you don’t have the above contract?

   1. Navigate to the M365 Admin Portal https://admin.microsoft.com
   <https://nyes.info/Newsletter/ExternalLink/208502?source=newsletter&guid=04710F04-380B-4CBB-BFA0-2D6C2D6D7DEE>

You will be currently using one of the following:

Free online Office productivity and learning tools. Includes online web
versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Microsoft Teams, and
additional classroom tools.
*Office 365 A1 Plus *
Offers everything that comes with Office 365 A1 and also includes the full

1. If the school has an active Microsoft OVS-ES volume licence agreement,
which includes the Desktop apps:

   1. Anyone with an A1 Plus licence after August 1st will need to be moved
   to an Office 365 A1 licence, the Office 365 A1 licences are free to schools.

   school Tenancy. This will add licences for the full Office Desktop apps.
   3. Assign M365 Apps for Enterprise to staff and students who require
   licences for the full desktop Office applications.

2. If the school does not have a valid OVS-ES agreement, the school can

licences.

,T20240610.0236,St Paul's Nursery,"Hi,
I wonder if you can look into some unfinished tickets for me please? I've had a few staff raise issues with the help desk and been told they haven't been dealt with yet.
In particular:
I asked for Jacqui Barnett to have access to the 'shared' folder and the 'staff only' folder. She only has access to 'staff only.' Her version of windows is also not activated and she still cannot print.

Our two admin pcs are linked to the Carr internet, not our own and I believe they have asked for this to be changed. They were told Johnny was coming in last week but he didn't arrive.

Please let me know when these issues can be fixed.
Kind regards,

Digital - Microsoft 365
Office 365 A1 Plus for education will retire on August 1 2024

Office 365 A1 Plus is being retired by Microsoft to ensure schools have compliant licensing plans, and to support the transition to cloud licences Microsoft 365 A3 and Microsoft 365 A5. Microsoft Office 365 A1 Plus program is an Office subscription that includes Office desktop apps for qualified schools that purchased Office institution-wide for faculty and staff.

Previously any school who purchased an Open Value Subscription Education Solutions (OVS-ES) annual volume licence agreement would get the Office 365 A1 Plus licence added to their Microsoft 365 Tenancy. Find out more here.<https://nyes.info/Newsletter/ExternalLink/208501?source=newsletter&guid=A99C8EB2-9D25-4923-B122-9120623A47B6>

[https://images.sla-portals.co.uk//https://nyes.info/File/NewsletterIssueImage/?imageGuid=de129d56-b683-4b16-8a8e-773986f6d5fb&size=Size600]

If you have a Software and Infrastructure contract with NYES Digital, no further action is required. The support team will check the licences for you.

What happens if you don’t have the above contract?

Then…
If you’d like to check yourself, you can do this from the Microsoft 365 Admin Portal.

  1.  Navigate to the M365 Admin Portal https://admin.microsoft.com<https://nyes.info/Newsletter/ExternalLink/208502?source=newsletter&guid=A99C8EB2-9D25-4923-B122-9120623A47B6> - Login as your school's Microsoft 365 Administrator.
  2.  On the left-hand navigation menu, go to Billing > Licenses.
  3.  Look for Office 365 A1 Plus for Faculty and Office 365 A1 Plus for Student assigned licenses.

[https://images.sla-portals.co.uk//https://nyes.info/File/NewsletterIssueImage/?imageGuid=8a96af59-9bf5-4e4b-87fb-032d4111c8f3&size=Size600]

You will be currently using one of the following:

Office 365 A1
Free online Office productivity and learning tools. Includes online web versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Microsoft Teams, and additional classroom tools.
Office 365 A1 Plus
Offers everything that comes with Office 365 A1 and also includes the full desktop apps for Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook) not just the online web versions.

After all existing Office 365 A1 Plus licences expire on August 1st, 2024, schools will have the choice to:

1. If the school has an active Microsoft OVS-ES volume licence agreement, which includes the Desktop apps:

  1.  Anyone with an A1 Plus licence after August 1st will need to be moved to an Office 365 A1 licence, the Office 365 A1 licences are free to schools.
  2.  Request Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise licences added to the school Tenancy. This will add licences for the full Office Desktop apps.
  3.  Assign M365 Apps for Enterprise to staff and students who require licences for the full desktop Office applications.

2. If the school does not have a valid OVS-ES agreement, the school can purchase Microsoft 365 Education Cloud Solution Provided (CSP) A3 and A5 licences.

Do you have an Software and Infrastructure Service Level Agreement with NYES Digital?

Yes and have an active OVS-ES:

  *   NYES Digital will move all your Office 365 A1 Plus licensed users to Office 365 A1
  *   NYES Digital will add the Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise to your Microsoft 365 Tenancy
  *   NYES Digital will assign the Microsoft 365 Apps to the schools users who previously had A1 Plus licences.

Yes but do not have an active OVS-ES agreement:

  *   NYES Digital will move all your Office A1 Plus licensed users to Office A1
  *   NYES Digital will provide a quote for Microsoft 365 A3 licences for your Faculty and Students.

Customers with a Software and Infrastructure Service level Agreement with NYES Digital will not need to do anything. NYES Digital will move your licenses for you and if you have volume license OVS-ES agreement we will ensure that your staff are provided with the Microsoft 365 Apps.

No, you are not yet a customer of NYES Digital
Please contact - nyes.digital@northyorks.gov.uk<https://nyes.info/Newsletter/ExternalLink/211053?source=newsletter&guid=A99C8EB2-9D25-4923-B122-9120623A47B6> and request a quote to manage your Microsoft 365 Tenancy, we will also be able to provide you with Microsoft 365 A3 licences.

Hi

I have this trolley and slowly one by one they're all running out of
battery ...

Does anyone have the charging cable in their classroom? As it is not with
the trolley, or in the location the trolley lives.

This trolley will be out of action for the foreseeable future if the cable
is not found.

Hi there.

Regrettably, I am writing to inform you about an incident, potentially involving one of your pupils, occurring on the 7th of June 2024 at approximately 9:45PM

The incident in question refers to the unprovoked harassment and assault of myself by a group of young people whilst I was walking through York City centre on the 7th. Video evidence is provided below.

As this incident and the accompanying evidence has already been reported to the police, I am writing to ask for any further information regarding the identities of the individuals shown in the video, as they have the potential to be pupils at your school.

From the video, it is clear that the individual in the grey tracksuit visible at 00:13 in the video is called Harrison and is around 15 years of age, whilst the individual in the blue tracksuit visible at 00:27 may be part of the York City academy. Although this information is limited it may help to identify these individuals.

If you manage to identify anyone in the video, please do not hesitate to contact me and ask for the appropriate police contacts so that you may forward the information to them, as I am aware you may not be at liberty to disclose any identities to me directly.

Many thanks
Dan

At Scarcroft Primary School, we wish to encourage staff to have a healthy
work-life balance, and therefore we discourage the sending of emails
outside of the traditional working day. Where emails are received after
6pm, over the weekend or during a holiday period, it is likely that a
response will be given during the school’s normal working hours. Thank you
in advance for your understanding in helping us to promote a happy, healthy
and productive workforce.

You don't often get email from dancostello944@gmail.com<mailto:dancostello944@gmail.com>. Learn why this is important<https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification>
Hi there.

Regrettably, I am writing to inform you about an incident, potentially involving one of your pupils, occurring on the 7th of June 2024 at approximately 9:45PM

The incident in question refers to the unprovoked harassment and assault of myself by a group of young people whilst I was walking through York City centre on the 7th. Video evidence is provided below.

As this incident and the accompanying evidence has already been reported to the police, I am writing to ask for any further information regarding the identities of the individuals shown in the video, as they have the potential to be pupils at your school.

From the video, it is clear that the individual in the grey tracksuit visible at 00:13 in the video is called Harrison and is around 15 years of age, whilst the individual in the blue tracksuit visible at 00:27 may be part of the York City academy. Although this information is limited it may help to identify these individuals.

If you manage to identify anyone in the video, please do not hesitate to contact me and ask for the appropriate police contacts so that you may forward the information to them, as I am aware you may not be at liberty to disclose any identities to me directly.

Many thanks
Dan

Message I receive says:-

I have Year 7 period 4 this afternoon. Any help getting up and running with Sketchup gratefully received!

,T20240610.0080,CEO Laptop - Wifi Connectivity,"I have spoken to Giles this morning to report a wifi connectivity issue
with Helen Winn's laptop. The laptop is trying to connect to HSLT-PSK
network but connects and drops out; highly unreliable.

At present, this is occurring in the Vale of York office, but Helen
experiences this at most Trust sites which results in her hotspotting
frequently.

Giles is sending Jimmy to set up a temporary wifi provision (hopefully very
soon), but this now needs to be escalated for prompt action and resolution.

Thank you.

,T20240607.0156,BLOCKED DOWNLOAD,"Hi

I have been given a suite of resources  - from a trusted source (Learnbox)
which I am having a great deal of trouble with.

I have been trying to download from their platform (and thought I had?)
inorder to upload to our learning platform Onefile - the aim being to sahre
the resources with our learners.

Every time I tried t upload the resources  -  I got error messages
saying 'Manifest
does not exist in Root Folder issue.'.

I have been supported this week by both Leanbox and Onefile who have
been trying to resolve the issue - however, just now on trying to share
the downloaded file with onefile I can't email it either.

I get this message when I do:

So now I'm wondering if the issue is with security from vital ??

Gareth@Onefile I've copied  in to try and avoid me being the middle man.

Please can you help?

I'm sorry - now we are using it more widely,  we've found that neither the
listing or the vocabulary list functions are working in Google.  They are
working in Word.

Both say that they are loading documents based on the words selected, but
then nothing happens - they should open a new tab and give a word list and
a vocab list.

They did work during the trial period for both Word and Google.

Thank you for your help,

Hi ya Jackson



Hope you are ok  😊



I have made notes on their account re staples not chargeable and I have
processed an order now for them S-6685



Good afternoon Jen



Hope you are keeping well



With reference to the signal I have checked our RRA and unfortunately we
haven’t received a signal from both your machines

FT      last data received    26/04/24   09:18:58

Please speak to your IT when they are on site next to check both machines
and if they need assistance then they will need to ring into the Service
department to log a call for an engineer to meet on site   telephone
number  020 8236 5832 press option 1



Please monitor both machines for the time being, so when an ink gets to the
half way mark then please give the consumables a call on 020 8236 5832
press option 2 or you can email consumables@riso.co.uk which ever is
easiest for you, please quote your customer number  138840 on all orders
and the model of the machine you are requiring ink for.



Hope this helps

Hi Elain 😊



I have just popped in to scarcroft primary school - 138840 - and they need
to order more staples (S-6685).



Please could you do this for me?

(They are also not chargeable as agreed with the trust).



Also, they have recently changed wifi providers so was also wondering if
you can check we are still receiving RRA for both the FT5230 and FW5230
machines?



I have copied Jen the school business manager in on the email too!



Thank you!

,T20240607.0062,Can log ins remain on all week?,"Hi, with the new PC system it seems to be that every day I need to log into
each PC that I use. Is there a setting so that the PC remains logged in for
the week? When i used my laptop, I just connected and I was already logged
in. So very little time wasted.

On some days I am in 6 different rooms (including form room), so at present
it is taking 5 minutes out of every lesson to log in. Then I have to open
up SIMS and do the same.

This is wasting a lot of learning time, not to mention not helping with
behaviour at the start of the lessons.

Hi Sabrina,

PaperLess v5 for Sage 200 is now available to all customers using PaperLess
for Sage 200 Professional, PaperLess for Sage 200 Standard and PaperLess
for Sage Education.

This brand-new version of the software introduces a *brand-new graphic user
interface, fully accessible via the browser, enhanced system performance,
increased system speed, improved reporting capabilities and also a mobile
app for online invoice approval and expense processing*.

PaperLess v5 also gives customers using purchase orders the possibility to
automate purchase order requisition processes with the new *PaperLess PO
Requisition Software for Sage 200
<https://app.greenrope.com/c1.pl?b78cb7f047e94904270e4273126eb2905bde68010d69d3235a05df9667396eee>*.
A powerful new module of PaperLess which customers can purchase and add to
their license to streamline and gain control over purchase order approval
processes.

*How to upgrade to PaperLess v5?*

The upgrade to PaperLess v5 only takes a few minutes. All you need to do is
to *click here
<https://app.greenrope.com/c1.pl?3a6b7b37ad795af265041c0c0de55b2ab217d888cfd1568609a471950fdb6521>*

Our team will then liaise with you to arrange a date for the upgrade to
take place.

Even though there are many training videos available, we recommend that
customers upgrading to v5 book a one or two hours training session with our
training team. This session will cover the main differences between
PaperLess v4 and PaperLess v5 and has a cost of £75/hour.

*Are there any costs to upgrade to PaperLess v5? *

Upgrading to PaperLess v5 is part of your maintenance package and therefore
completely free of charge. The only cost is the recommended additional 1 or
2 hours online training session.

,T20240606.0205,Speakers for PC in S19,"Hi,

We used to have speakers on the window ledge and desk for the PC in S19 as
the wall mounted speakers (either side of the projector) do not work.

It seems with the removal of the old PC unit, the speakers have been taken
too. Therefore we have no speaker sound - only small sound from the
built-in PC speaker.

Please can the speakers for the PC be fixed as soon as possible?

Please note, the speakers on the bookcase are a separate unit and for my
lapel microphone. Please do not change the set up of these.

Thank you
Lauren

However Helen will still need an Ebor email address until 19/07/2024 as she
needs Governor access at Tockwith Primary Academy. We can't leave Helen
with access to her current email address as she has access to things as a
School Business Partner that a Governor doesn't have access to.

Can you set up a new email address for Helen please? If possible can you

,T20240606.0173,[MEDIUM] Alert for Sophos Central [Ebor Academy Trust]: We detected ransomware,"From do-not-reply@central.sophos.com: SOPHOS CLOUD

This email alert was generated by Sophos Central. Do not reply to this email.

Sophos Central Event Details for Ebor Academy Trust

What happened: We detected ransomware running at the detected IP address and trying to encrypt files on network shares.


Where it happened: EBOR-DATA01



What was detected: CryptoGuard


User associated with device: n/a


How severe it is: Medium


Detected IP Address: 10.73.224.93



What Sophos has done so far: We have blocked write access to the network shares from the detected IP Address. If the computer with that address is a workstation or server managed by Sophos Central, and Protect document files from ransomware (CryptoGuard) is enabled, we clean up the ransomware automatically.


What you need to do: 1. Find the computer where the ransomware is running (its IP address is the detected address shown above).
 2. If the computer is managed by Sophos Central, make sure that Protect document files from ransomware (CryptoGuard) is enabled in the policy.
 3. If cleanup doesn’t happen automatically: Move the computer to a network where it is not a risk to other computers. Then go to the computer and run Sophos Clean (available in the Sophos directory).
 4. Go to Sophos Central, go to Alerts, and mark the alert as resolved.

Hi Lee

I hope you are well.

For the past couple of days I have received hardly any emails, the usual
suspects being tomorrows seclusion list, today's staffing changes and the
daily advertisements for internal job vacancies, together with the other
blurb I receive from the companies we regularly make purchases from. I am
kind of enjoying the tranquillity but wanted to make sure nothing was
wrong.

,T20240606.0078,Office equipment,"Good morning,

I would like to organise some new office equipment as we have had a change
around in the main office and have an extra member of staff.
The new member of staff is using my desktop computer which only has one
screen so can she have another one please?
I thought I could work on a laptop but I am finding it a bit frustrating so
could you set me up with a workstation or do you think a separate keyboard
and mouse may suffice?
Tina would like to have two screens. She currently works on her laptop so
would this work alongside another screen or would she also require a new
workstation?

Lots of questions, hopefully you can give me the answers.
Ideally we would like this equipment sooner rather than later.

Thank you

students whom have English as their 2nd language will struggle with
translations.

I would say this needs to be approved by Gill because of the external
effects it will have.

Thanks,

Jimmy

I believe that Hannah has been in touch from AHS.

I am the Chair of Govenors at AHS and Vice Chair at Hempland.

My email address is dtaylor@hempland.pmat.academy <mailto:dtaylor@hempland.pmat.academy>

Historically I have used this email via my mail client, MacMail. To do this I ‘add’ the account to MacOS, however, when I tried to re-add the email address it was blocked.

I have attached the error message. I have also attached my MacBook information. 

Please let me know what additional information is required to enable me to add my email to MacOS. Oddly, I am able to add it to my iOS email client on my iPhone which is the same process. So there seems to be an inconsistency, however, I do not want to be doing all my emails via my phone.

Please can you email me with their usernames and passwords, once created.
They are both already on the system with start dates weeks ago.  Most

Is it possible to upgrade me on the google workspace so that I can use AI
to record and summarise meeting minutes when using Google Meet - if that is
possible? I was on a call with Grace Kelly from Gemini and she implied that
it was possible and that this was a secure way of minute taking. I need to
test it out and gain consent to use it but I thought I would see if it will
actually work first. If there is somewhere I can go to try it online that
would be really good.

I am trying to enter an incident onto CPOMS but need to use the
Authenticator to do so.

I am connected to the school Wi-Fi but the app is not available.

This means I am having to enter incidents after the school day on my own
time which is not what should happen.

Could you please let me know why this is happening?

This has only started happening since half term. It works fine at home once
the Smoothwall time has finished.

Subject: Attn MARCUS Fw: Your OneDrive is out of storage space

Hi Marcus

I'm getting regular messages along these lines.

Did Stuart also tell you I can no longer download photos to my pc? I'm wondering whether that's connected to storage.
It's a problem that needs sorting asap as the photos are needed for the weekly newsletter.

Hope all's well with you

Claire

I'm getting regular messages along these lines.

Did Stuart also tell you I can no longer download photos to my pc? I'm wondering whether that's connected to storage.
It's a problem that needs sorting asap as the photos are needed for the weekly newsletter.

Hope all's well with you

I'm hoping you can help me. Recently my surname changed and I did this
centrally with yourselves. When I share a google doc (see first screenshot
below) it shows my correct surname of Holmes.

Sharing a google document:
[image: image.png]


When I send an email, it still shows my maiden name of Smithson (see
screenshot below)

Sending an email: [image: image.png]

It has been brought to my attention as it is causing some
confusion/problems with sending documents for example to safeguarding
agencies and I don't feel it looks very professional, especially when I'm
sending documents to ofsted etc.

Please can someone have a look into this for me? I mentioned it to Giles
yesterday and he couldn't see a quick fix so asked me to log it as a ticket.

Much appreciated.

,T20240605.0026,Files so slow,"Good Morning,

Firstly, I am very much enjoying my new PC and keyboard so thank you very
much! The screen is huge!

However, all my files are on my memory stick and whenever I try to navigate
through files it seems to take ages! I've attached a screenshot of the
green bar that takes at least 5mins to open just one folder. Sometimes it
can be fast though so I've no idea if there is a reason behind it. It's
usually the slowest when I need to do something time dependent! It has also
crashed a few times when I've used Powerpoint too - either trying to save
one or close one.

Not sure if you can help?

Before the new Teams storage system came in, we used to have access to an old German textbook package via the start button/apps list - Echo Active Teach. This has disappeared from the list under ""Languages"" but we have just arrived at the point where we need it again!

Do you still have access to this to restore it please?

Thanks,

I hope you are well. I just wondered if the installation of Illustrator is
a possibility? I understand it is not a priority at the moment but if you
can spare any time to do this that would be a great help. I have my laptop
with me whenever you can get around to it.

Many thanks,

Jack

Subject: Unable to download photos

Hi Stuart

It's not my IT day! I've been trying for ages and in vain to download photos from my phone to the PC here at work.
In the end, I've had to post from my phone.
I'm wondering whether it's because of storage issues as I keep getting messages. I have (I think!) emptied the recycle bin but I have lots of photos from eg Bridget, plus videos, docs etc, which are large.
Can my storage be expanded and/ or can you fix my download problem please?

  1.  I don't want these photos on my phone

  1.  They need to be on the system for the Trumpet, Terringtonian etc.

Hope Caitlin's exam went well today!

Subject: Laptop Keyboard
To: Mr Wilkinson <gwilkinson1@tanghall.pmat.academy>


Hello Gav,

Hope you've had a really relaxing half term.

I'm having trouble with my laptop keyboard. There are several keys
which are only typing sometimes/after multiple attempts & it is therefore
taking me a long time to type!

Before half term it was just the 'I' but now it is the 'K' and comma too.

Any help appreciated,

Tess

This padlock has appeared on my screen which opens and locks. It first
appeared when I was on CPOMs so I assumed it was a new level of security,
but I've now gone on to my emails and it's still on the screen and won't
go!! Bizarrely, when I've tried to screen shot/snip the screen to show you
it doesn't show!!

Any ideas??

Thanks

Hi Rob

Noted that Boiler House 2 at Robert Wilkinson has lost connection - our engineer investigated on site and found that the patch lead missing from port 3A patch panel (this is the connection to the boiler house 2)

Could we ask why this was removed and that IT can re-estate this cable

If you could let us know when this is done and we can check the connection to the EnteliWEB

Best Regards

I can't seem to access the ofsted website on my Macbook.
Also - I don't seem to have full access whilst on the network via my Ipad
(eg. it just says there's not a connection, when on google drive, for
example...when I switch to tethering from my phone, it's fine).
The ongoing issues we seem to have with Apple whenever the
certificates/passwords change are quite annoying.

I have included a screenshot of the ofsted website not complying with the
AUP.

Please let me know what action I should take.

Hi Russ

Since the changeover the IPad pro for our visually impaired pupil won't connect.

We logged this several weeks ago and have been chasing but were told someone was on holiday and it would get passed on but have not heard anything since.  His review is coming up and we will need this for it.

Can you push things along?

Hi,

There's a chromebook in Trolley 1 and a student has just said the number
keys 1 and 2 don't work so she couldn't log on. I've put a post-it on the
top for now.

Adam - copied you in as you're having this trolley next.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: Chrome Flex

Adam,

Would it be allowed and possible to create a generic supply@tanghall.pmat.academy<mailto:supply@tanghall.pmat.academy> account that we could use for logging all supply teachers onto the newly Chrome Flexed machines? All they would need access to is the internet and the shared Tang Hall Supply google drive that we already have set up, I could then just add the supply@tanghall.pmat.academy<mailto:supply@tanghall.pmat.academy> account to give all of them access.

Does that make sense? It's just that right now, we would have to log supply teachers in using our individual teacher accounts and that sounds like a potential security risk to me.

Or is there an alternative option???? Let me know what you think,

I have been struggling to access my PP for the last week as the screen as it is impossible to see. It was working fine and I have no idea why the access point has changed. I will need to be logged on for you to see the issue. I am in the room Period 1, 2 &  5 today. I have a very small class Pd2 so this would be the best to time see the issue, if you are available then...

Thanks

,T20240604.0023,loss of access to resources,"Hi
The change of computers has lost science access to a KS3 book that we have
had access to for years. This happened previously when IT changed something
a few years ago and I managed to get a work-around myself. The change in
computer has lost that for me and others in the dept.
If I had known I would have spent some time making screen recordings of
useful items or saving certain resources.
Please can this either be reinstated or I be given access to a computer
that will let me save a lot of valuable resources that are currently gone.
This is impacting a lesson I have today and would have used that resource.
Thanks. Regards
J

My safeguarding lead Nicky Ellis will not be in work for the next 2 weeks.,
please could I ask the account is suspended for this time,and that emails
are redirected and email address and the redirection to both my email

This is to ensure that there are no meetings or safeguarding emails which
are missed during her absence.

Would it also be possible to put an out of office on advising recipients of
this redirection.

Since my new desktop has been fitted my smart screen no longer works as a
touch screen as it did before e.g. I used to be able to zoom in on
powerpoints, swipe for the next slide ect. Could you please come and have a
look at this when you get time.

Secondly, the google drive desktop app is no longer available. I used this
everyday and now I have to go online, log into google drive, download the
powerpoint and then adapt. If I make changes it will no longer be saved
like it used to be. This is not just something I used but the whole science
department. We would really appreciate it if this could be re-installed.

Also,  when I am at Brotherton I need to access the shared to admin folder

Afternoon,



Last week we ran out of ink because the machines were not connected to the internet, I was asked to call back with the number but it was so busy last week I never managed it. It's school hols so I don't have clarity's number so could you please  pass this on for me. It's Vital 03448736100.

An engineer came the following day and was meant to check the ink levels but didn't and I know we are out of black in on the library printer.  From memory I think we only have pink ink in stock for the large machines.



Thank you,



Caroline

,T20240603.0255,RE: Urgent - GDPR google calendar sharing,"Hello Hannah,

We do not manage users' individual Calendars Permissions, this is only set by the end user – so I wonder if it’s a setting from your predecessor.  I can certainly help and explain setting permissions on Calendars.

Are you free for a call – we can do a remote session, free on my mobile.

Hello
I've been liaising with Diane as I've had an issue getting back into Itrent
after its update.

I have used the new links and followed the instructions to get back into
Itrent, but I received this message.

[image: image.png]
I have tried to use the Authenticator App, but I can't get my work emails
on my phone, so that won't work either.
Unfortunately I cannot get my work emails on my phone because I already
have a personal gmail account and when I've tried to add my work one it
won't let me and  I get a similar message

Diane said I would have to wait for MHR to solve the problem now. I'm not
sure who this is and do I need to contact them?

I've got a fair bit of stuff to authorise. Staff have had time off and I've
not been able to authorise it.
Is there anyone else I can contact to help me ?

I hope you are well.

The Copyright Licensing Agency (CLA) is doing a data audit in the
near future at Barlby High School, and I was wondering whether you might be
able to assist.

We need to identify how many photocopiers etc are used in the school (I
believe the number contracted is 12, is that correct?) and where these
are located.

We will also need to provide figures of how many documents and numbers of
copies have been captured of published materials so that the CLA can award
royalties to corresponding authors.

The CLA have stated that they will conduct the audit remotely so data will
be recorded online and via the CLA Copy button in PaperCut MF, which allows
staff to record data at the photocopier. Do you have any awareness of
this/does the school have this function?

Many Thanks

I would like to mark for AQA while in school as I don't have space to do
this at home with
young children. I plan on marking in the office after school when there is
no one else here so it will be a confidential space protecting GDPR. The
exam board have recommended not marking on site due to concerns over
protection of information on school computers.
Would you be able to recommend whether there is a computer I should use
i.e. school chromebook over a computer or bring in my own from home etc.

Hi Julie,

So sorry to message you in the holidays and I realise that you may well not
see this until Monday!

I am having problems logging into my work gmail account on my laptop. This
is where I have got to after having a few tries at resetting the password
and failing.

I wondered if you had any ideas how I can resolve this or does it need
sending to admin?

I am able to access my account via the phone so am assuming it’s to do with
my laptop.

Thank you,

Helen

Review what actions to take before the policy is turned on.
[Microsoft Security]
A Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policy in your tenant will be turned on the week of 24 June 2024

You’re receiving this email because you’re a Global Administrator, Security Administrator, or Conditional Access Administrator for Woodlesford Primary School.

As part of our Secure Future initiative<https://nam.safelink.emails.azure.net/redirect/?destination=https%3A%2F%2Faka.ms%2Fsfisecurityblog&p=bT02ZWY2NDFmNi00MDYxLTQwZjktOWU3YS04NmExNzJjYjQ2YjImdT1hZW8mbD1zZWN1cmVfZnV0dXJlX2luaXRpYXRpdmVfMTE%3D>, we created a Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policy<https://nam.safelink.emails.azure.net/redirect/?destination=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2023%2F11%2F06%2Fautomatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection%2F&p=bT02ZWY2NDFmNi00MDYxLTQwZjktOWU3YS04NmExNzJjYjQ2YjImdT1hZW8mbD1taWNyb3NvZnQtbWFuYWdlZF9jb25kaXRpb25hbF9hY2Nlc3NfcG9saWN5XzEy> in your Woodlesford Primary School tenant.

This policy, Multifactor authentication for admins accessing Microsoft admin portals<https://nam.safelink.emails.azure.net/redirect/?destination=https%3A%2F%2Faka.ms%2FMMAdminMFA-email&p=bT02ZWY2NDFmNi00MDYxLTQwZjktOWU3YS04NmExNzJjYjQ2YjImdT1hZW8mbD1tdWx0aWZhY3Rvcl9hdXRoZW50aWNhdGlvbl9mb3JfYWRtaW5zX2FjY2Vzc2luZ19taWNyb3NvZnRfYWRtaW5fcG9ydGFsc18xNA%3D%3D>, was created in report-only mode<https://nam.safelink.emails.azure.net/redirect/?destination=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fconditional-access%2Fconcept-conditional-access-report-only&p=bT02ZWY2NDFmNi00MDYxLTQwZjktOWU3YS04NmExNzJjYjQ2YjImdT1hZW8mbD1yZXBvcnQtb25seV9tb2RlXzE0>, which means that it doesn’t block any access, but it does generate reports on how it’ll affect users when it’s switched to the On state. Now that this policy has been in this mode for 90 days, it’ll be automatically turned to On during the week of 24 June 2024. Once the policy is on, all users covered by it will need to have multifactor authentication.

Required action

To avoid any potential disruption to users’ access and to ensure that this policy meets your organisation's needs, take the following actions before 24 June 2024:

  *   Review the effects and benefits<https://nam.safelink.emails.azure.net/redirect/?destination=https%3A%2F%2Fentra.microsoft.com%2F%23view%2FMicrosoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess%2FConditionalAccessBlade%2F%7E%2FPolicies&p=bT02ZWY2NDFmNi00MDYxLTQwZjktOWU3YS04NmExNzJjYjQ2YjImdT1hZW8mbD1lZmZlY3RzX2FuZF9iZW5lZml0c18yMA%3D%3D> of this policy. If you don’t want us to turn it on automatically, set it to Off. Or, you may set it to On at any time.
  *   Customise this policy according to your specific needs, such as excluding emergency access accounts<https://nam.safelink.emails.azure.net/redirect/?destination=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fentra%2Fidentity%2Fconditional-access%2Fconcept-conditional-access-users-groups%3FWT.mc_id%3DPortal-Microsoft_AAD_IAM%23exclude-users&p=bT02ZWY2NDFmNi00MDYxLTQwZjktOWU3YS04NmExNzJjYjQ2YjImdT1hZW8mbD1leGNsdWRpbmdfZW1lcmdlbmN5X2FjY2Vzc19hY2NvdW50c18yMQ%3D%3D>. To make more extensive customisations, you can duplicate Microsoft-managed policies and make any changes you need. 
  *   Verify that all users covered by this policy have enabled and registered at least one multifactor authentication method. If necessary, run a registration campaign<https://nam.safelink.emails.azure.net/redirect/?destination=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fauthentication%2Fhow-to-mfa-registration-campaign&p=bT02ZWY2NDFmNi00MDYxLTQwZjktOWU3YS04NmExNzJjYjQ2YjImdT1hZW8mbD1ydW5fYV9yZWdpc3RyYXRpb25fY2FtcGFpZ25fMjI%3D> to set up the Authenticator app.

To: Mr Davison <n.davison@ebor.academy>


Dear Neil,

I hope you are well.



My name is Hal Butcher and I am currently employed at Park Grove Primary
Academy as a relief teaching assistant. I have been employed since the
return back to school from the Easter holidays and was promptly set up with
an ITrent account to record my hours.

For the the last 2 weeks of the half term my access to ITrent was suddenly
blocked meaning I have been unable to record my hours officially since the
week of Monday 6th May.

I have let the staff at Park Grove know this but am sending this email as
an additional notice.



In the mean-time is there a solution that is best for me to record my hours
in order to make sure I am being paid fairly?



Thank you in advance.



Best wishes,

Hal Butcher

creating/updating resources for classes.)

2. As per the note I left, turn the desk by 90 degrees so that students

Please could you advise whether you have done the steps below. Just a thought, would it be possible to do this as a TeamViewer session with Adam and then you can both agree that the steps have been completed.

Thanks,

Subject: ChromeOS OnGuard - Woodlesford Primary

Afternoon Rob

Sorry if this needs to go to someone else.

We are looking at deploying the onGuard application for Woodlesford, would you be able to complete the following of give us access to the Google tenacy so we can complete this?

When you get to the JSON part of the documentation you would need the following JSON

{""policyserver"": {""Value"": ""filter.wavenetcloud.netsweeper.com:3431""},
""makeopts"": {""Value"": ""-y woodlesford_primary -f 923649 -g nsw_pupil@383-2314 -t 987""},
""whitelist"":
{""Value"": [""stylesheet://, 1"",""script://, 1"",""image://, 1"",""font://,
1"",""object://, 1"",""ping://, 1"",""csp_report://, 1"",""media://,
1"",""websocket://, 1"",""other://, 1"",""filesystem:, 1""]}}

Ideally if this could be pushed to a test device before a full rollout is completed so it can be verified it is functioning correctly first. We don't have the access to complete this task.

I have attached the full documentation which guides you through the process.

Many Thanks

Hi,

We've received an alert that the site, DFES816-3212 - Robert Wilkinson
Primary, has gone down. Please can local power and connections to the NYnet
equipment be checked and confirmed.

If we need to investigate, please can you supply site contact details and
access times.

Is the down due to planned maintenance on the LAN which was mentioned last
week?


Thanks,

Hi David,

               Only a quick follow up from yesterday, the desk top reader
quoted will also work with MIFARE ® Classic and Paxton don’t see a issue,
so long as they are genuine cards.



If you wanted to send a spare card, we can pass onto Paxton to test your
cards.



Don’t forget that Paxton 10 allows Bluetooth connection to smart devices
and they can be used as a card/token or you can use the keypad or buy
Paxton MIFARE ® Classic cards,

 Hi Alex, I have spoken to Rachel in our admin dept that sort our ID cards
to see if they would be compatible with the system you have quoted for.
Does this work or do we need to tweek the reader on the quote?



i've just been on chat with Paxton and they said the following:



Okay mifare classic cards are compatible with Net2 , you will need to get
mifare readers like in the link below :



https://www.paxton-access.com/products/net2-proximity-mifare%c2%ae-reader-p50/



This is the link to the cards we buy incase you need it:

I have been adding a handwriting scheme from Twinkl to google drive and the
teaching slides are in powerpoint form with animations. However, they
obviously transfer straight to slides when these are then uploaded and this
then loses the animation. Is there a way to get the animations back? Also,
when saving them to drive directly from twinkl they are a zip file
which then doesn't let you open it - any suggestions?

Good morning Julie!

It's me again with the same problem but more so today!
I received an account action required notification shortly after you kindly
emailed on my behalf, but I had to put in my existing password to progress
to the next step. As I don't have that password it has now frozen my
account in offline mode. I can still read existing emails but can't receive
or send any from my ebor account.
I used the email address you had used yesterday and sent an email from my
personal email account to see if I could get the problem sorted. I then
received a message back to say my account couldn't be reset without the
request coming from an ebor email address! Which of course I now cannot do!

Please could you send another email on my behalf to ask for it to be reset?
Until it is I can only access emails on this account. Thank you so much,

Lauren

Morning Adam

In preparation to our meeting can you complete some testing of the two access points at The Leyes please. And check whether the access points in Maddy’s class are live - it’s just by the stock cupboard door.

In addition the PC in the hall has had connectivity problems and Matteus thinks that an access point would be better than the plug in dongle or whatever it is currently in.

Ping Gateway - *FAILED*
DNS 1 - Succeeded
DNS 2 - Succeeded
Ping Proxy - *FAILED*
Spine Add Res - Succeeded
Ping Spine with Proxy - *FAILED*

,T20240521.0173,Re: Studybugs - Lost Connection - New MIS,"From Studybugs Support <support@studybugs.com>: Hi ​there,

Did you get a chance to read my message below? We lost connection with
Poppleton Ousebank Primary School on the 15th of January and have not been
able to share live attendance data with York council ever since. It would
be great if this could be resolved today. This process typically takes no
longer than 5 minutes to complete.

*If you have an IT team that you'd prefer we contact directly, please let
me know their name and email address.*

Now that you've been fully migrated over from RM Integris to SIMS, you can
connect Studybugs to your SIMS account here
https://studybugs.com/schools/27743/help/studybugssync/sims. Once you've
made the connection, we'll fetch the latest data from SIMS and then migrate
the data in Studybugs accordingly.

In order to view the link above, you will need to be signed in to your
Studybugs account. I can see you already have one set up. If needed, you
can reset your password here: https://studybugs.com/resetpw

I hope this helps and let me know how it goes.

Kind regards,
Lee​

Google Chrome MV2 Extension disablement

Dear ,

We recently wrote to you about an upcoming change which Google is making to their extensions platform. To recap, from June 2024 Google will be phasing out existing MV2-based extensions, ahead of the launch of their MV3 Platform in June 2025. They will be starting with ChromeOS 127. Read their change update here.

Our records indicate that your school still needs to take action to avoid unnecessary disruptions to your Smoothwall Filter’s performance. Please act now.


What action do you need to take?

You need to do one of the following now:

Update ChromeOS (recommended) - Upgrade your ChromeOS to version 110 or later click here for details of how to do this or

Migrate to Smoothwall’s self-hosted version of the Chrome extension. Click here for details of how to do this.

Please ensure you make this critical update before the end of May 2024 to avoid interruptions to your filtering service.If you have any questions, please contact me, your Customer Success Manager, I am here to help.

Morning

Ash - for context Rachel contacted me to ask for a payment that had gone
through on my school credit card and it was a zoom account renewal.


My zoom account is jrogers@copmanthorpeprimary.co.uk, password Greenrat55!!


However, when I tried to log in it sends a verification code to my email
that I can no longer access. Could you ask vital to unsuspend it perhaps
and reset the password perhaps to get this email? Or ask then to get the
code?
I presume there's a timescale on the code so you may have to coordinate
with vital.

I hope you get it sorted and can make use of the account. I'm not sure how
to cancel the auto - renew though as I thought I'd cancelled it? Unless it
was Emma's that's auto renewed and not mine?

Many thanks

Jenny

,T20240517.0092,school house printing,"Hi,

I was wondering if you'd been able to speak to the engineers at RISO about
being able to print from chrome books?
The engineer as here the other day and said they had a fix for this and to
call them 020 8236 5832

And if this can't happen, we're still waiting for a quote for a stand alone
printer for the school house which would be compatible for all the laptops
and chrome books in there.

I already spoke to someone at Vital about this, but wanted to check
progress.
Many thanks
Helen

Subject: Minecraft Workshop

Hi Adam,

I will be delivering a workshop at Park Grove Primary at some point in the near future, as part of this workshop I will need access to wifi for 17 laptops and the links within this website whitelisting please. https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4404784181524-URLs-Used-by-Minecraft-Education

To test all is working I have the following guidance:

I find the best way to test Minecraft is to find a machine with it already installed and login with a Microsoft account. As long as it gets past the login screen, we will be fine. Alternatively, you can download and install Minecraft Education for free vi this link >> Download | Minecraft Education<https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/get-started/download>.

Failing that, you can try the following URLs.

NOTE: If manually testing these sites (i.e., through a web browser such as Edge/Chrome), don't worry if the page is blank or you get an XML error, we are only concerned if you get a warning message saying that the website is blocked by your Internet Service Provider (e.g., for games etc.). Any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Apologies, I am hoping you may be able to point me in the right direction.

I am trying to clarify whether we have loaned out any chromebooks to
Y10/Y11 students in recent months.

Do you know who would be the best person to check this with? I am aware
this is not something we ordinarily do however, wanted to clarify this with
you?

Thank you so much

,T20240513.0237,APPALLING INTERNET,"Colleagues
Today the internet has been unbelievably poor - again - / non-existent
causing huge difficulties for safeguarding and behaviour  (not able to take
registers / not able to read / action CPOMS / not able to pick up behaviour
incidents / not able to request callouts) and even bigger problems for
teaching and learning (including delivering exam presentations for GCSE
students).
Am I able to get a reason for today's issues and a sense of how often this
is likely to happen? We are desperately trying to improve our school and
these repeated internet outages are not helping.

Please find instructions on how to reset the RA, the changes will be activated 24 hours after it is done so we can check on our systems then. . If you require more guidance, please email softwaresupport@riso.co.uk<mailto:softwaresupport@riso.co.uk>

We spent a considerable amount of time getting them up and running at the

Subject: VNC viewer

Hi, previously I have been set up with VNC viewer on my Y4 teacher ipad, so that a student of mine, who is visually impaired, can mirror what is on my laptop.

I'm not sure if it was after the broadband changeover, but basically my computer disappeared from the list of connections on the VNC viewer app on the ipad.

I've had a play with it, but can't seem to get it connected again.

Please advise.

Thanks

I work from home on a Wednesday and the remote desktop has started

working on it. It says something about the licence.

It did this a while back but Giles seemed to sort it. I'm wondering if it's
started again since the broadband change over?

Not a big problem as I can log straight back in again but if it could get
sorted again please, I'd be grateful!

Hello
Sorry for the group email, just easier! I've just been reading the vision impairment functional vision assessment for my new boy who is starting year 2 after Easter.
He is going to need a Chromebook that he has access to at all times for touch typing, vital need to install VNC team viewer on all computers where Olaf will access learning and an iPad that he will use to mirror what is on the IWB, vital will also need to download dolphin easy reader to the iPad and other VI friendly apps that are shown in the document attached. If possible he needs a large print ruler, wider bold lined paper and larger squares for maths and a slope board.
I will ensure all materials are printed at N24.

Can you guys help me with any of this?!
Thank you!

,T20240222.0223,camera in H14,"Hi
The ELMO camera that was disconnected / cut by the team when installing the
Smart screen in H14 is not happy.

It was reconnected by someone recently (as it should never have been cut)
but  it is not happy and keeps on cutting out. Please can someone look at
it (and perhaps chat to me about it as a few people have been involved in
this now)

Thanks
J

,T20240206.0065,Batch file to run on server (SIMS Reports),"Good morning Andrew,

I have passed on a batch file to you that runs the SIMS commander reporting
tool for some SIMS reports

Are you please able to set up a scheduled task to run this file on a server
that has access to SIMS (possibly Apps02?) and also it needs to run using
an account that can save the info to the shared file paths identified
within the file?

I would like the task to run Mon-Fri
10AM, 12.30PM, 2PM, 3PM and 4PM

If you need any further information from me please let me know. I know
James has done some of these tasks centrally so may be able to help?

Kind regards,

I would llke to look at setting up a whitelist where the Chromebooks that
are situated in the reflection area at Pindar are only able to access the
google suite and apps through chrome. Specifically we are looking to block
Youtube in this room. Is this something that can be done on the Smoothwall
for those devices?

,T20240117.0277,Replacement of faulty ID14 interface,"Hi Carl,

Ben was working on replacing one of the Audient ID14s which is faulty. He
came to take the serial number of the device and said he would action it to
get Academia to send a replacement but I've not seen the replacement yet
and fear that ticket might also have been lost. I've still got the faulty
device if you need it to action that.

Also while I'm on. Now the playback issue has sorted itself out, we don't
need Giles and Ben to come in. I'll speak to Sibelius about the grey
buttons when I can.

Cheers

Dave

,T20231128.0193,Fwd: Blocked wrapper,"Hi

I have just tried to use the KS3 science textbook wrapper in H12 and it
says 'this app is blocked by an administrator'. Please could it be
unblocked. It is located in ""J:\Science\Longman\Exploring Science - How
Science Works\at"" if that helps. If this is a PC thing rather than a my
user thing please could it also be done in labs H9 - H15 as they should all
have access to it.

Thank you
Jo
