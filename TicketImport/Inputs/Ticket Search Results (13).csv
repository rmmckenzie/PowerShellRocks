Hi

I am hoping you can help me. The school has recently started sending out letters using Microsoft Sway. My husband and I are unable to open these as our phones say that Sway is not a safe site. We have tried various ways to try and allow the site to open anyway but haven't found a way to bypass it with this particular site.

Is anyone else having this problem? Do you know of a resolution to this issue? Do you upload the letters elsewhere that I could access them from?

It has been a while since I have been able to read a letter sent out by school so hoping I haven't missed any important information.

Kind regards Victoria

Hi Tom,
I have an issue with my camera; it seems to have stopped working for the
last couple of meetings I have had to do. I think it might be something to
do with settings rather than the camera being broken. I have a meeting at
9.30 today.
Please can you have a look?

I hope you are well.

Smoothwall and internet access to the school system can be removed, but
they need to understand that this would no longer be permitted in school. I
would recommend that you discuss this with Vital (help@vitalyork.com) to
ensure that it is completed effectively. This would be the same situation
for the year 11's when they leave.

I have copied the helpdesk into my response.

Although Giles put the computers back together after we had the room
decorated, the screen set up he did for the computers isn't working for
everyone.

Please can someone sort out the computers so they are 2 screens without the
projector being a third screen but being available to drag the screen onto
the projector screen? That's how it was before and how everyone would
prefer it like that. I thought it worked but it isn't working for everyone
else.  We also need a second screen at the back of the room set up in the
same way.

Do you know when this can be done? The room is free at the following dates
and times:

Today from now until 3.00 pm
Friday 1st March - all day
Monday 4th March - all day until 3.00 pm

Hello Giles,
I hope you don't mind me contacting you directly as  Carl is not in school. Earlier in the week we asked for Tudor Shepherd's email account and any associated IT accounts to be closed.  He is an Advanced Teaching Assistant.

Please could the email account be open so that Mandy Watson our HR Director can access Tudor's emails.  I have copied Mandy into the email, so you can you let her know when she is able to do this.

Many thanks

Hi Andrew,


Thank you for letting us know.

I can see that the migration to SIMS has taken place and that CPOMS should
be linked to your SIMS, but it looks like the server information has
changed since it was set up.


Please can you check with your IT that the details in my previous email are
correct and let me know the result?


Kind Regards

Thank you for responding so quickly.
As a trust, we have transferred to SIMs from January this year. We were
previously using Integris, but have had everything transferred to SIMs. I
have copied our IT support services into the response so they are aware
too.
Please let me know if you require any further information.

,T20240227.0144,WJEC Exams issue - Graham & Pindar,"Hi all,

Please could you ensure that the following urls/ports are allowed for the
WJEC secure client:

Whitelist the following exception address and ports:
• https://wjec.surpass.com/*
• cmspublic.surpass.com*
• cms.surpass.com/*
• www.btl.com/*
• https://demo.surpass.com
• Ports 80 and 443

I think this is causing an issue with regards to the delivery of the exam
as the packets are inspected/decrypted and are not working correctly.

This will also need to be done for Pindar School too as we both have the
same client and exams for this exam body.

Best wishes,
Lee

We are currently unable to login to the chromebooks at Huntington when
using an adult login. The children's logins are working fine. When trying
to log in with an adult login it first takes the username then directs you
to the microsoft account login where I enter the full email address and the
password again, it then asks if I want to stay logged in or not. At this
point it doesn't matter whether I choose yes or no it then brings up the
wifi screen before returning me to the original log in page. This is
happening with multiple adult accounts and I have tried this on several
chromebooks with the same issue.

Please could you advise?

Many thanks

I’m Amit Agarwal, Google Developer Expert and the founder of Digital
Inspiration <https://digitalinspiration.com/>.

I’d like to personally thank you for installing our *Email Notifications*
add-on for Google Forms. The add-on helps you automatically send email
alerts to different people based on answers in the form response.

We are happy to share that we have extended your free trial for 7 days to
help you explore the benefits of our add-on. After the trial period ends,
we kindly request you to consider upgrading to a premium plan
<https://digitalinspiration.com/buy/?sku=GA08&email=vkeel@ahs.pmat.academy>
in order to continue using the add-on.

With the premium upgrade
<https://digitalinspiration.com/docs/form-notifications/google-forms-premium>,
you can send conditional email notifications, there's no branding in the
email body, attach Google Drive files in the emails, and your daily email
quota is increased to 1500 recipients per day. *The addon will
automatically switch to the free (limited) mode after 7 days.*

You can learn more <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvZ2tM0m7AY> about the
Email Notifications add-on on our website — Digital Inspiration
<https://digitalinspiration.com/docs/GA08>. Should you have any questions,
please reply to this email.

Thanks.

Subject: Request for Temporary Access to Retrieve Lesson Resources

Dear Alister,
I hope this email finds you well. Have you been doing fine lately?
I'm in the process of adjusting well at my second school.

I have a small request to make. While at Huntington School, I saved my lesson resources from Block 1 onto the P-drive.

If those resources are still available, I believe they would greatly assist me in planning lessons at my current school.

Would it be possible for you to request the IT team grant me temporary access to retrieve these resources? I understand if this might take some time, but it would be extremely helpful if I could have access until the weekend.

I really appreciate any help you can provide.

Best regards,

Yoonhyuck

Morning,



I would be eternally grateful if anyone can get my speakers working again – since the new laptop I cannot get them to work.



I have that careers day P1 – the laptop speakers work – but it is not particularly loud with a class in.

See email quote from Emmy Lovewell-Evans regarding their ICT problems at
Millthorpe.

*"" We are having a lot of trouble with the interactive board in our
classroom at the moment. My ICT knowledge is really poor, however I think
it could be the HDMI lead that connects the board to the PC. Would you
therefore see if there is a HDMI cable lying around at mainsite for us to
borrow and see if that sorts the issue. There is also a computer bit
screwed to the back which I have tried to get going (we have a wireless
keyboard etc to use with it) but I have never been able to sort that. Maybe
you wouldn't mind having a quick look next time you are over?""*

Can someone go over to help out and check this out, please. Her email is
elovewell-evans@applefieldsschool.co.uk if you would like some more
information.

Good morning,
I hope you have had a lovely weekend.
I’m emailing in because my son Alfred Griffiths 9LAy is having trouble
accessing class charts.
He has asked his form tutor for a new password but that didn’t work. He’d
really like to spend his merits!

Also, I’m sure that the bus companies keep an eye on this but just in case,
the bridge in Stamford Bridge is due to be closed for a few months starting
on the 9th April, and we just wanted to pass the information on as it will
affect bus routes.

Kind regards
Emma

Our system shows that the remote agent connection is not working on the
printers for your consumables. Please find instructions on how to reset the
RA, the changes will be activated 24 hours after it is done so we can check
on our systems then. If it is still not working then we will send out an
engineer.

The computer in the Intervention Room (near the Learning Resource Centre
and SEMH room) at the 'Justice' end of the room isn't playing ball.

When I tried to open Chrome, the screen flashed black and the browser did
not open.

It may be because the PC is connected to two screens. However, both screens
were on and neither showed Chrome.

Another member of staff has also mentioned that she'd prefer for the
screens to be positioned so that the cursor's movements follow the
intuitive direction (they're currently the other way round- I hope this
makes sense).

**On Behalf of Abi Schwarz, Strategic Lead ITE, Mentoring and Partnership**

Good afternoon,

I hope you are well. As we now have our HIVE system fully embedded our IT
Team are intending to disable the URN accounts next week.

All mentors (including PLCs and Heads) should have a HIVE account now and
access to Eprofile and the Partnership Portal is granted through this. You
will therefore no longer need a URN account.

If you have not registered for the HIVE as yet, please can you ensure that
do so as soon as possible.

Thank you for putting clevershare onto the ipads at Huntington Primary. I
have been trying to use the app but on my clevertouch screen it is asking
me to update the app (on the clevertouch not the iPad) in order to connect.
Is this something I can do here or do you guys have to do it?

The students are unable to log on to the laptops and do any work. We have a lot of students who heavily rely on these throughout their school day.

They were like this on Friday too.

Hope you can resolve it quickly.

Just to let you know that my laptop has been a nightmare today whilst
trying to present things to the Trust and visitors from Gorse:

- Completely crashed and stopped responding 6 times in 1 hour whilst trying
to present pdf's and word documents. (Each time then taking ages to turn
back on again)
- Slowed down to beyond snails pace (opening a simple word document or a
simple pdf was taking 4-5 minutes each time)
- Would open a document one minute and then would shut the document down
half way through me presenting it and display the following message when I
tried to open it back up again (see below)
- Also as of 3 days ago it will not open up any Promethean file anymore
(and again wouldn't open any to show in the meeting today)

I couldn't take a chromebook with me to present things as the files I need
to open aren't supported by chromebooks.

I'll bring my laptop in on Monday but I am fearing that it is up to
capacity again?

If there is anything at all that you can do to help improve it again I
would appreciate it as it was really embarrassing in front of visitors to
the Trust today. (I have a similar presentation to do on 15th March if you
can do anything before then please?)

Could you pop in to the data office to chat through with me re what we do
about claiming ownership of Google sheets/docs etc, after the staff member
leaves?

,T20240223.0190,Updates to security groups and email lists,"Hello Vital

We've checked the list sent over and there are a few people who do need
removing from the security groups/email distribution lists - and one or two
to add.

I've highlighted the changes in the attached spreadsheet.

I think in most cases of leavers the user accounts have been disabled when
they have left, but they haven't necessarily been removed from the lists.

The plan is, I think to leave Jonathan Green on all.admin for now as he is
still doing some work using his school laptop for TEAL and uses that
account to log on and save work. However he no longer needs to be on the
all.governors, I believe. Kate Durham, on the other hand, will need adding
to that!

If anything isn't clear just drop me a line or give me a shout,

Thanks
Kat

Please note we have a new Kitchen Assistant starting with us on Tuesday 5th
March, Miss Amie Lynch. She will initially be starting on a red lanyard as
we are still waiting on her DBS clearance but as we have been waiting since
December HR have allowed us to start her on a Risk Assessment. Dan is going
to make sure she is supervised at all times. Please can we set her up with
the following in time for her starting with us on the 5th:

Becky - Please could you set her up with an Arbor profile with a start date
of March 5th? I have her details in my office when you are ready for them.
Please can you let Tom know as soon as her profile has been created so he
can create her Gmail and Windows logins.

Tom - Please can you set her up with IT and email logins once Arbor has
synced with Amie's new profile.

Anna - Please can you set her up with a Parent Pay account. I have asked
her to send in a photo for her staff lanyard. As soon as her DBS comes back
I will save it on the K Drive and let you know. Please can you then send
this over to Pete to create her staff ID card for us.

Emma B - Please can you add her to the staff list on the website from March
5th

Please let me know when you have actioned these things and I will update
her starter checklist.

Thank you!

Your request (495391) has been updated.

----------------------------------------------

Josh Rocchi, 23 Feb 2024, 11:03 GMT

Good Morning,

We have provisioned your Smoothwall Monitor service and will be handing you over to our Support Team.

This means you can now go ahead with the installation and the links below are to be used as reference points when deploying Monitor within your environment:

Monitor Help Centre - KB Homepage

How to install the Monitor Chrome extension with Google Workspace - Chromebook Deployment

Integrating CPOMS with Monitor (UK) - Integrating CPOMS

How do I know that Monitor is monitoring my devices? - Checking Monitor is working

Troubleshooting – Monitor Help Centre - Basic troubleshooting

For Smoothwall Monitor to be deployed successfully, you will also need the following information: (which can be found via the Monitor at portal.smoothwall.cloud)

**Both the UNCL and ORGID are within Monitor > Organisation. Click Edit > Select Licence information.**


Your Safeguarding team may also find this link useful to understanding the platform, in particular the “Events” section which includes tables showing our justification for giving alerts specific levels: Using Monitor

If you need technical assistance, we would advise contacting your local IT support team or you can submit a request here: Submit a request – Knowledge Base

For all other questions please contact your Customer Success Manager at Smoothwall directly.

Once Monitor has been installed your Customer Success Manager will be able to provide some training to make sure you and your colleagues know how to get the most out of what Monitor has to offer. When appropriate please could you let them know a time that suits you and they’ll get this booked in.

_**Please note that Smoothwall Monitor is NOT recommended or supported by Smoothwall when installed on non-managed devices. Please note that Smoothwall Monitor is NOT currently available to work on Android devices.**_

Many Thanks,

I've tried to do this but it won't allow me to send them to her via Google

Is there any other way of me sending the forms to her to complete?

Hi Stuart,
I will contact Gareth direct and speak to him on the phone tomorrow regarding y8.
With the planning, the last 2 years were moved, but the archive file was not moved. I am particularly interested in the 21/22 year. Unfortunately I have not got a copy of the planning at home. If the archive could be moved, I can send the appropriate topic to Peter.
Thanks

Please see below the email that Jordan is receiving. There is no hyperlink
to the incident on smoothwall, only the banned site.

I don't get these emails at all, nor is Kyle.

When Kyle and I go onto smoothwall events, there is no sign of this alert.
The only two incidents are those that predate the change.

We've run several sessions already to upload the software and asked that
students be sent to wherever at whatever time.  A lot of students have been
missed for whatever reason.

I am going to send another reminder to parents soon, and will send a copy
of the information to all staff so they know what's going on.

Hope that helps.

Hello and good morning,



Thank you for getting in touch with us to request the Black toner for the
above machine.

I will arrange to get the new toner delivered to your site as urgently as
possible and can check this tomorrow for an ETA.



The machine is not currently communicating with us on our internal
monitoring system, any toners needed would need to be requested manually
when the message appears to advise this is running low. It is also
recommended to confirm the total for Mono / Black & White & Colour each
month.

To better understand how often the toners need to be sent out, we can look
at getting this set up on our KPAX monitoring system. This ensures regular
updates and is also set up so that an alert will trigger each time one of
the toners reaches 20% of the expected yield so that we can get this sent
to you before the need to replenish.



   - *You can arrange the KPAX installation/reconnection investigation by
   clicking here
   <https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/DMCPrintAuditManagement@dmcplc.co.uk/bookings>.
   Alternatively, you book in via our website, by going to
   www.agilico.co.uk/kpax/ <https://www.agilico.co.uk/kpax>*



Thank you for your time again and take care. Please let me know if there is
anything further I may assist with.



*Thank you*,

*Craig*

Hi

Just wanted to chase up regarding my laptop as it is obviously not in great
condition. I am conscious that the longer I continue to use it the worse
it's going to get. One side is being held together purely by the wires, so
if they become damaged it will stop working all together.

Please can someone advise

To: Mrs Smith <h.smith@ebor.academy>


Hi Helen,

The children have previously had the Color Overlay chromebook extension
which allows children who have an overlay need to use it on their
chromebook all the time, but it disappeared from their extensions bar
yesterday and I'm not able to install it for them.

Is this something I can just message vital about, or do I need to go
through you to see if they can put it back on?

Thanks,

Huw

Hi Liz,

Can I pass on a request to Vital through you? My interactive screen's touch
doesn't work. The best way I can describe it is when touch is turned on, it
is like something is touching the top right corner so I can't touch
anywhere else.

Thanks,
Jack Gallacher

As quickly mentioned on the phone to Holly, we'd like to make sure that
these security groups and email distribution lists are up to date - it
looks, from what I can see in the directory and in google groups, as though
in some cases the accounts have been removed for some leavers but they may
have been left in the groups/lists. We also want to make sure no leavers
have slipped through the net!

Would it be possible to get an up to date list of the memberships of these
three groups at Naburn school?

Is it possible to have a yearbook email set up to collect messages and photos?

I need to get these off staff and students but do not want them coming to my own inbox.

Not sure if there is another more efficient way? My worry about using a one drive folder is that I do not want them editing each other's photos or messages.

Thanks.

I recently received a new computer and it does not have crumble downloaded

have it on my computer to show the class. If someone could come in and
download this that would be great.

At Scarcroft Primary School, we wish to encourage staff to have a healthy
work-life balance, and therefore we discourage the sending of emails
outside of the traditional working day. Where emails are received after
6pm, over the weekend or during a holiday period, it is likely that a
response will be given during the school’s normal working hours. Thank you
in advance for your understanding in helping us to promote a happy, healthy
and productive workforce.

Good morning
Yes, she had told us. Poor Heather, but it sounds like she still played a good game!
 If Heather would like to go to the Hub first thing and pick up a laptop she can use this as long as she needs to. I will email her teachers to let them know.

Hi!

Hope you are both okay and enjoyed half term.

I understand Claire Carr has already messaged you, but just to confirm Heather has broken her right thumb and it’s in pot. Similar to one of Claire’s sons but he has done his left thumb. Heather is right handed.
We go back on Monday 4/3 to see what the consultant says and hopefully it will have repair by then.

Yes, it was a hockey injury, she stopped the ball with her thumb which meant that her thumb was sandwiched between the stick and ball. She didn’t let it stop her though she continued for the last few minutes of the game which led to them scoring another goal. After the game Abi Brown gave her some snow from the side of the pitch to act as an ice pack before she started on the real ice packs.

I shouldn’t have said to her, well I’m pleased you aren’t playing 2s this week as Huddersfield tried wiping you out a few times last time! She got asked to play 1s and got a broken thumb! 🤦‍♀️ She played so well too. Hopefully it will repair quickly and she will be back in working order soon.

Kind regards,

Veronica

The telephone in our school kitchen (extension 3807) is not working; it
will not allow incoming or outgoing calls.

The kitchen staff need to have contact with other schools who we provide
meals for and the companies from whom they order food.

Please could someone come and look at the phone as soon as possible

Hi,
Due to the Trust  Reading plus development for library lessons can we block
book trolley 2 to the library or take it off the booking system? The
English lessons require chromebooks in the library lessons and rather than
having to try to book each week it would be a better system to be a
permanent resource in the library for library lessons and homework club and
tutoring sessions. Can this be done starting next week? All the Key stage 3
assessments should be done by the end of this week so this week would cause
issues but next should be fine.
Thank you. Kind regards,
Liz

As briefly discussed, with effect from Monday 26th February, can we please
request that the switchboard phone is turned to NIGHT MODE from 4pm EACH
NIGHT.
Also, the switchboard currently turns on at 7:45am each morning, this
should be 8am EVERY DAY if possible please.
HOWEVER, if this affects people calling the sick line, then this can
obviously not happen.
They currently need to call the main switchboard number and then dial
extension 2017, not sure if changing the switchboard timings make a
difference to this?

what on the face of it is a potential malicious email from colleagues,
stating that documents/file have been shared with the recipient  via
Microsoft 365.



I am advised that the majority of recipients happen to be safeguarding
leads for the respective schools.



With that in mind I wish to make you aware of the current increase of
reports over the past couple of days and to alert you and your teams of the
potential threat of unsolicited emails and malicious links.



I am yet to formally identify if they links are malicious or genuine,
however I am taking this precautionary step to notify you for further
dissemination across the education authority for East Riding.  If you have
a like contact in the Hull area whom I can forward this to it would be
appreciated.



I will not post the link here as to authenticate this message but ask that
you visit the NCSC website for the governments advice for phishing
campaigns by threat actors and subsequent threats you may encounter in the
Cyber Landscape.



I am available to take any questions relating to this via telephone or
email.

Hi Tamara,

My computer will not send anything to the printer. This happened before
half term and I was hoping it's rest would have sorted it but that is not
to be so.

Thanks

Hello Cara



Thank you for getting in touch.



It does look a bit suspicious as there is nothing in the content of the email.



You can either send it through to IT and they can check it for you. Or you could contact Wakefield Council (not using the email address given below), and ask them did they send it. I would recommend that you do not open the attachment until you have confirmed it’s a genuine email. Also ensure that no other staff have received it and opened it until it’s confirmed genuine.



Many thanks

Jo

,T20240220.0205,Class 5H crashing computer - Alderman Cogan,"Good afternoon

Please can you advise on what we can do next regarding this
computer/projector set up?

This classroom has been having issues for many weeks and we have tried
almost everything to get this fixed. Class 5H's board/projector keeps
crashing and causing a blue screen, forcing us to restart the computer to
be able to use the board again.

You have swapped the PC out, installed a new projector and most recently
Elementary came and fitted a new wall box and HDMI cable to the new
projector previously installed. Unfortunately, today the screen/projector
crashed a further 3 times this morning.

Any ideas on what to do next?

Since returning yesterday many students in my classes have been unable to
use their iPads. I understand from Rachael's email that students without
smoothwall are just blocked now until they've agreed to your terms,
however, I've also encountered a lot of students who have been through the
smoothwall setup, but the new Wifi network is blocking them from accessing
their work. I've seen the attd. message several times. Learning has been
significantly disrupted.

Also please can you email me with information about which Wifi network
students should and should not be accessing so I can advise
them accordingly.

cheers
Dave

Hi Paula

The calendar is called 'Research School New 2198' in Public folders.  The only sharing option I have is to email it (which takes for ever to create a file).

Do you want to search for it with this name in public folders and if you can't find it, I'll have to speak to James about how to get you access.

Thanks

I have just gained access back to my room (221) after the building works
and the sound is no longer working through my speakers. The cable used to
go directly from my speakers into the PC but it is now wired up through the
trunking and appears to go into the projector. This means the sound from my
videos just gets played out of the computer which is not loud enough for
lessons. Please could you either have a look or let me know if there's
something I need to change (I've had a look in the settings but can't see
anything obvious to change).

I asked him to log out and go back in and try again and it was just the same unfortunately.
This was also happening before we broke up.
It is not happening from my machine therefore students are having to send me their work to print which is not ideal.

,T20240219.0213,Remote Desktop,"Hi

I've been keeping a eye on this for the last few weeks now as I thought it
was coincidence at first but now I don't think it it.

Every hour I get a message about having no remote desktop licence, exactly
2 minutes later it logs me out of the remote desktop session and I have to
re-start all over again.

As you can image with it happening every hour when I'm in the middle of
work is really starting to become irritating if I'm mid way through emails
or invoices.

It would be great if this can be looked into please?

Just a heads up that I was researching fanfiction for A level Media  as the
use of fan made products is part of the course and a studied theory by
Media professor Henry Jenkins. I tried to look at 'Archive of Our Own'
which is apparently (like Wattpad) a fan fiction archive - it flagged it as
pornography!!! Yikes

I have recently upgraded to Adobe Acrobat Pro in order to redact documents,
however when I try to open up files from the shared Google Drive for our
team we cannot find the folders in Adobe Acrobat Pro. This however is not a
problem within the Google Chrome browser, I can access files just fine on
there.

To add to the confusion, we do not have the option to redact documents with
Adobe Acrobat Pro either. The program is trying to update, however it says
that the automatic update has failed and needs to be done manually.

Is there anyway that I can access this shared drive from within Adobe
Acrobat and also help with the update problem?

All the best,

Oliver

I am a Pathfinder trainee at Poppleton Road Primary. The teachers in my
team use the cursive font called 'XCCW Joined 1a' in the vast majority of
their resources they create for pupils. I have been told it has to be
installed as an app in order for it to work with SMART. As I am a trainee,
I use my personal laptop to do the majority of my planning etc. Would you
be able to instruct me on how to install the font on my laptop? Is this

Hi Deborah,

Do you have a spare laptop/chrome book that we could loan to Heather Ridsdale while she is has her hand in plaster?

James doesn't have any spare and mentioned that you might have one.  This is likely to be for 3 weeks.

I've just bumped in to Heather Ridsdale and her mum at the hospital. Heather has broken her thumb on her right hand. Would you be able to arrange for her to have a laptop for her lessons when she is back in school next week? She is not going to be able to write!
I have copied James into this email, so he can hopefully have a laptop ready for Monday morning.

,T20240216.0015,Don't miss out.,"From ""Nick Porter"" <team.wfal@wefindanylearner.com>: Hello,

We are absolutely thrilled to announce that we are offering not one, not two, but THREE of our most popular online courses completely free of charge! Yes, you heard that right - FREE!

But don't wait too long to register your interest, as spots are filling up fast. This is an incredible opportunity that you won't want to miss out on. You can easily sign up on our website at www.wefindanylearner.com/book-online/ or by contacting our team at 01226 958 888.

All you need to do is meet a few simple criteria, including being at least 19 years old by August 31st, 2022, residing in England, and not currently enrolled in an apprenticeship program.

Enrol today and let's make a difference together!

Counselling Skills Level 2
Many people find it helpful to seek counselling at some point in their lives, and a counsellor can provide support for people in all sorts of situations. If you’re interested in supporting people to improve their personal well-being, this course will provide you with the correct understanding, knowledge and skills to do that. You’ll learn about core counselling skills and how to use them in a counselling relationship. You will also be taught about counselling theory and the ethical framework that informs how counsellors use their skills.

Mental Health First Aid Level 2
It’s important that employers are transparent and open about mental health issues, and this qualification builds an understanding of mental health problems and the support available to colleagues. Increasing the understanding of the mental health of staff at all levels builds a culture of care and support.

Understanding Autism Level 2
This course will give you an understanding of autism and the principles of supporting individuals with autism. You will look at the person-centred approach and the influence that positive communication methods can have and will gain an understanding of how individuals with autism can be supported to live healthy and fulfilled lives.

If you would like to come tomorrow as it is half term please let me or mrs
smith know so we can be here to let you in. Otherwise please just let us
know when you are available!

Hi Jacqui,

I agreed with Andrew to retain my access until May half term so I can
support Hannah though her first term.

I think you've already put that into SIMS but I'll let you know if it can
be closed earlier.

Hope that's OK with you

Hi Mrs, no I didnt miss any lessons when doing the assignment. In Rebecca's
Dairy, I believe I had more support when writing it. I normally struggle
with timing when doing assessments. But I'm sure I'll get faster if I do
more of these.

Good Afternoon,



I write to request access on behalf of Openreach for an engineer to
complete the new broadband installation at *Tang Hall Primary Academy*.



This installation will *not* affect the existing service; the new service
will run in parallel to the existing connection, until NYnet & NYES Digital
engineers visit at a later date to complete the switch-over (tbc).



Please could you advise whether you would be able to provide access for an
Openreach engineer on the morning of *Wednesday 14th February *to complete
the new fibre installation in the comms cabinet on site?



If this is convenient, please could you confirm from what time the engineer
could gain access to school.



Thank you.



Kind regards

,T20240210.0020,RLG classroom IWB connection,"Hi,

Our smartboard could not find a connection to the laptop the afternoon of
9.02.24. We are also finding that the use of the touch screen can be
temperamental when the IWB is connected to a PowerPoint or smart notebook
and does not always enable touchscreen. We have tried changing which usb
slot we connect the cable to which sometimes works, but not always. The IWB
alone has been working fine, it’s just when it connects to the laptop we
sometimes have issues.

Thanks,
Clare Gamble

Just logging as a job the moving of my computer from the back wall of the
ground floor office to the 4th floor.
When I used to be in that room on the 4th floor there was a computer on the
back wall, under the notice board.  If at all possible can I be put on the
back wall ? There used to be a computer there before.  Then any one else
can be put at the side, as they seem to be demanding (although
the other side!).

If they all have to go in a row, we have already discussed that !!

Subject: New Starter - Y8 Kacie Baines

Hi All,

Kacie will be joining us from Monday 19th February, she is coming on an OSD trial from JoRo.

Background: Kacie has poor attendance at JoRo which is the reason for her trial, she attended 35% in Y7 and 1% in Y8. This is an opportunity for a fresh start. There are no behaviour concerns around Kacie she is suffering from social anxiety.
Due to her poor attendance, we have limited knowledge of her current levels, however she has a non-verbal CATS of 75. Gareth and the team will be assessing her as soon as she starts with us so we have a better understanding of how to support her. For this reason she has been placed into the Y8 nurture group.

Kacie attended primary school with a few of students, Haxby Road. She currently knows Lauren N and Brie.

We will be keeping a close eye as she settles.

Any concerns please let me know

Thanks

Kim

Our Y6 children use Vocabulous ( https://www.vocabulous.co.uk/) in school
and there are a few children who can't watch the videos that are part of
the learning.   The lady from Vocabulous said it is not at their end as
other children were able to watch them ok so thought it maybe something to
do with their settings.

The children are -

17kairuil@stl.pmat.academy
17ethanl@stl.pmat.academy

,T20240209.0072,Laptop not printing,"From ""Wigginton Primary, Head"" <head.wiggintonprimary@york.gov.uk>: Hi,

Charlotte Sweeting has been in touch a few times trying to resolve the issue of her laptop not printing.  It gets fixed temporarily but then we have the same problem again.  I've tried logging on to her computer too, to see if I could print, but the photocopier does not come up as an option.  Could someone look at this as soon as possible and if we continue to have issues, does the laptop need replacing?

Hi Georgina,

Is it primary or secondary resources you're trying to access?

Sometimes users have a problem when their email account is blocking emails
from us.

You should have a safe senders list or something similar in your email
settings- could you add hello@thirdspacelearning.com to it?

Thanks,

Hi Lewis,



Can you please order 2 new PC’s as upgrades for the main office? Current ones are 5 years old. Not sure why they have been missed previously on the 3 year managed service. Replacements definitely need to be on that. Also, both need to be a decent spec as they do a lot of large file transfer/photo/video editing, and use the adobe full suite.

Also, they need large monitors. Claire’s one needs to be 32”, and the other 27” please.



With my best wishes,



Stuart

You are correct Stuart – Simon’s PC was due to be replaced, but because of this faulty batch (unfortunately one of your new admin PC’s has this fault) I’ve had to postpone the install. Again I do apologise – I’m working hard on trying to resolve the issue with Dell.

Thanks Lewis.



Talking to Simon K (the Head) the other day. He recalls someone from Vital circa the summer suggesting his PC was going to be updated at some point. I am not sure why, as it is one of the new PCs already. He seems unsure also. Any idea? No problem if it is to be done, as I can use the current PC elsewhere (there will be more new PCs to put on your scheme as the old ones die).



With my best wishes,

Subject: RE: PC solution



Hi Stuart



I’ve asked Marcus to have a quick look at the science lab setup just to confirm the best solution. He will also look at the faulty laptops.



I do apologise regarding the PC’s that you have on order, as the install will now be scheduled for the half term. The reason for this is that my last order of Dell PC’s have had a number of faulty devices which I’m currently resolving with Dell.

Subject: RE: PC solution



Hi Lewis,



Can we please have a teacher laptop ordering? This is for the science lab (teacher currently uses a pupil laptop at the front as there isn’t an obvious location for a PC by the interactive whiteboard). What he does need also is an extra long cable (currently, it is trailing 2 ft off the ground, so not safe).



Separately, I have a broken laptop in my office for collection (just does not work, not sure why), plus one other in the upper prep cabinet (ICT room) has a missing key.

I noticed Deacon had an incognito browsing window open when he should have

Also, in the last Digital Literacy session, children were VERY interested
in the different search engines and data history saving.
I wonder can we have Vital stop that?

for space a few weeks ago. Now I am trying to install again but the
Microsoft site will not give me access to apps such as word or powerpoint
on either this old email or the new email (cbrett@hpa.pmat.academy).
Please could you advise how I install the Microsoft apps again as I am told

 Our research yielded that the file being quarantined belongs to an application that several of our security vendors have flagged as having suspicious behaviours, although is not necessarily malicious we wanted to contact you to verify the legitimacy of the application in your environment, as mentioned before Crowdstrike quarantined the file and killed process, but a manual deletion on host machine is recommended and just wanted to contact you to confirm it's legitimacy.

 Hi,


I believe that CYC It have spoken to you regarding the following, but have
asked  that we raise a ticket.

Please can you.



many thanks

Hi Louise,



We've noticed 2 of your Lexmark MFD's aren't reporting on our automatic
toner ordering and meter reading application ""KPAX"" (the 2 Toshiba's are
fine) I suspect this may be that the Lexmark printers aren't on the network
or are on a separate network to the Toshiba devices, I'll need to liaise
with your IT representative to investigate this. Could you forward this
email to them and if they could click here
<https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/DMCPrintAuditManagement@dmcplc.co.uk/bookings/>
to
arrange an appointment so we can troubleshoot the issue.



Alternatively if you have a date scheduled when they next visit your school
if you could let me know and I'll call them when they are on site



Regards



Steve

has said that she has never been able to access the account.

I am unsure if it's a password problem but she said there is an error

She had difficulty accessing it on a computer. Would it be possible for
someone to have a look into this account for me?

,T20240208.0040,Backup issues,"At home I have a 1TB Extreme SSD hard drive I'd like to use for my Time
Machine backups.

However, in Get Info, it says only 50GB is available (and 949GB is being
'used' - probably by the Time Machine backups from the old laptop). Under
'sharing and permissions' it says 'you can only read'. I don't know how to
change this? Ideally I want to reformat it - wipe it - and then use it as
backup for the new laptop (while I'm at home - in the office it's the NAS,
which is another problem yet to be fixed).

Any suggestions?

Cheers

Tim

Whenever I need to print on ""Follow Me on Colour"", (which I'm having to do
today because the printer in the DT work room isn't working because it
needs toner which hasn't been replaced yet), it doesn't actually come out
in colour. It only ever prints black and white for me unfortunately. This
is a big problem because it's for Art GCSE portfolios. When the computers
went down it was the Art GCSE mock exam so it was crucial. Please can you
take a look as soon as you get a chance (or drop off a print cartridge so
that we can continue printing on our normal printer)?
Many thanks for your help!
Keira.

The sixth form student leaders met with Jane and I at lunchtime and mentioned that the number of sites that are blocked is a barrier to them doing their work in study periods. I know we find it tricky in criminology lessons as there is so much they can not access.

Hello

I'm wondering if someone can help me please.

I can successfully transfer pupil data to ParentPay from SIMS, however when
I try to transfer a new member of staff over it doesn't work and I receive
an error message.

Hello Jeanie

Please see the failed screenshot below you cannot use the same id for staff
new staff have to have a new id please add a different id in and try again.




Any new staff members of visitors can be added to the ParentPay system
using MIS Sync. Currently, any  changes to the staff and visitor details
(such as changing a name due to marriage) will need to be completed by the
ParentPay support team.

*WARNING: *When adding new staff or visitors, you must also include any
staff or visitors who are already on the ParentPay system in the upload.

If only the new members of staff or visitor records are processed in the
upload, any records already held on the ParentPay system will be
overwritten and archived. This will then prevent current staff or visitors
from accessing their ParentPay account.

   1. Open the *MIS Sync* program and log in
   2. Select *Staff > Manage data* or* Visitors > Manage data*
   3. Select *Import*.
   [image: mceclip0.png]
   4. You will receive a message stating how many existing records have
   been imported
   [image: mceclip1.png]
   5. Select *OK*. The *Manage tab* will be opened, and all staff or
   visitors currently held in the ParentPay system will be displayed. You can
   then add, amend, or delete records here
   6. Select *Save*
   7. The upload tab will open. Ensure the *Export to* option is set
to *ParentPay
   Web Site*, and select *Export*
   [image: mceclip2.png]
   8. The data upload will then process. If it is successful, a message
   reading *Succeeded* will be displayed.
   [image: mceclip3.png]
   9. These records will have been sent directly to your ParentPay website
   and the staff/visitor details can be viewed in *People > Pupils and
   Staff* by changing the *Group 1* drop down menu to Staff or Visitors.
   10. Activation letters can then be created for the staff members or
   visitors added to the site.

Hello Jeanine

This means you will need to locate your SIMS.net folder so MIS Sync can
extract the details from SIMS to upload the pupil data. You would need to
do the following on MIS Sync:
1. Click on Tools > settings > SIMS

2. Where it says MIS username MIS Password, you need to enter in your SIMS
username and password and NOT the ParentPay username/password

3. Once entered, click the yellow folder and it locate the SIMS.net folder
(this should open and try to locate your SIMS.net folder location.

4. Once you see the SIMS.net folder,  click Test these Settings which
should say, connection test was successful, then Save.

5. Now close MIS Sync, log back in then click on Pupils > Auto update.

If you still get the same error could not locate SIMS with your current
settings, this means that you have not selected the correct SIMS.net
location. This would be something you would need to speak to your IT team
about.
In order to use MIS Sync and SIMS, the user needs to have the following in
SIMS:
3rd party reporting rights in SIMS and their access must be admin or higher
which could be the reason they cannot locate the SIMS.net folder.

Kind regards

,T20240207.0142,Ethernet connection,"Good afternoon

I think I have a problem with the Ethernet connection in my classroom. I cannot get the computer to project onto the interactive whiteboard. I think this is the problem because when it wouldn't work the other day, Stuart Keens got it to work by pushing the cable in further. He noted at the time that the connection seemed dodgy as the cable moves around inside.

I’ve attached photos and a video to show the problem. This is the Latin room classroom where the problem is.

Many thanks
Katie

Dear Hannah,

I have been having problems setting up the email alerts using the account
details you have forwarded on to me.

When doing some testing using email  login credentials from another school
then they are working and I can send test emails, and the automated
versions have been received by Sue who I was speaking to today.  However
when I use the info you sent through I get no emails and I tried a test to
Sue who also didn't receive it.

Please ask the IT support staff who looks after the school's email to take
a look to see if there are any configuration changes required in the email
system. Also attached is the setup I am using, can you please ask them to
check if this would correct for your email system.  I do know the username
and password are fine.  They can call me on 07971 820092 if they have any
questions.

Many thanks

Mark

Hi Craig, I have a student whose work has disappeared from a google doc, we have pressed the edit undo button but it is not working. Is there any way you would be able to retrieve it? There was a lot of work and it'S strange that the edit undo is not working.

Student is Michael Thomas yr 12

G2 printer shows but nothing prints.

This is for random students and not each lesson or a specific computer.

Can you please look into this and find a solution, can you also let me know
what the problem is, so that I am aware.. I cannot afford to have students
unable to print, as they need to modify the prints from models made from
that print.

The only way at present that these students can print is by emailing me
their work and me printing for them. This takes my time away from being

Dear Mrs Larvin-Smith

I just wanted to check in to see if you received my previous email about a school volunteer trip to Ghana, Kenya or Zanzibar where your students can contribute to real change at one of our partner schools.

No two trips of ours are the same, and we would love the chance to organise one for Archbishop Sentamu Academy.

Please let me know if you would like me to send you more information, including costs and an itinerary.

Hi all,

We have a new login to use in student reception:

Login: studentreception
Password: YellowHouse38! (Captial Y and H)

If whoever is on student reception first thing each morning, can log in on the computer furthest from the reception office door.  This computer will then have access to Inventry for the day.

You can then login as normal onto the other computer

You will be free to access everything you need from both computer, sims, ClassCharts, email via the web version of outlook etc.

Hopefully this will ensure that everyone can access Inventry when they need it.

Jo, Debs, Alex and I will still have access to Inventry from our logins as normal for use on main reception.

Please let me know if you have any problems.

Thanks,
Claire

Morning,
Just to let you know, after our experiment the other day about leaving
something on the printer for the following day. I sent something last
night, but it wasn't there this morning, so obviously it picks and chooses
what it's going to save! Just thought I'd let you know.

We use Teams a lot now within documents to 'call' staff, i.e. @Vital York Support<mailto:help@vitalyork.com>...they should get an email with a link to the document the call came from. Quite important feature as I call for emergency cover/meetings and the like.

Some teachers have said they are not receiving these calls, but many do. Is there a way of me checking who is able to receive them, is there a way to switch whatever setting is currently off, on?


With my best wishes,

Hi toni



There should be a network switch with cat 5 cables connected to it.



The cameras are powered from the network switches (PoE) power over ethernet.



It would be a case of unplugging the camera from the port waiting 30 seconds and plugging it back in



Hope this helps?

Hi Toni



We would need to come and look at what is required.



It could be a simple power cycle or a replacement camera, you could always ask your it if they could do a power cycle?



Otherwise it would be a call out.

Good afternoon,



We have been kindly advised that you have an outstanding XoD install to
enable data synchronisation for your application: CPOMS


Onboarding selected: Self Install

Xporter on Demand is required to be installed on the SIMS server to allow
data to sync.
Can you please take the time to complete the install by following this
guide (we advise that you liaise with your IT manager)


https://support.communitybrands.uk/s/article/Xporter-How-to-install-Xporter-SIMS

If you would like assistance, please read the requirements below and inform
us of an ideal date/time and IT contact to access the SIMS server

Contact name:
Contact email:
Contact Phone:
Date:
Time:

Xporter on Demand cannot begin syncing data for your authorised application
until this has been installed.
Please ensure the below requirements are met:

   - A dedicated SIMS user is created as per this guide
   <https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/tbGmCDkKK7UOlWo1T5oLhl?domain=support.communitybrands.uk>
   - Have the username and password ready in a Notepad file on the desktop.
   - Access to the SIMS server or suitable workstation
   <https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/ocsECERLL7i65zlmupgqpJ?domain=support.communitybrands.uk>
(can
   log into SIMS locally).
   - Check your .NET Frameworks, Security updates, Windows updates are all
   up to date
   - Click here for our tool to check your .NET framework versions.
   <https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/7NLQCG6NN7UL5PBmcQ3ufe?domain=support.communitybrands.uk>
   - Please check Pre-requisites | Xporter
   <https://support.communitybrands.uk/s/article/Xporter-Server-Pre-requisites>
   to ensure Groupcall Xporter URL's are unblocked

If your server is hosted by a third party or your Local Authority, please
let us know and place an IT request with them directly. They will then be
in touch with us to complete the installation.

Kind regards,

Jenny Davies

Hi Steph,

I'm contacting you today as we have received a notification that you chose
self-installation of Xporter on Demand for use with CPOMS.

I can see that Xporter hasn't been installed yet. A link to the guide is
below, if you have had any trouble getting the software installed please
let me know. Please ensure that the software is installed on the SIMS
server rather than a workstation computer.

https://support.communitybrands.uk/s/article/Xporter-How-to-install-Xporter-SIMS


Alternatively, if you would like us to install the software for you, please
go to our Remote Page <https://xporter.uk/remote-support> and choose me
(Dan Haslum) as the technician

In the meantime, it is worth checking the following that we have the

,T20240206.0185,Re:[## 134727 ##] P4 - Hope Sentamu Learning Trust - CrowdStrike - cplusplus.exe on host STJ-ADMIN01,"Hello team, 
 
 CrowdStrike has alerted behaviour on the host 'STJ-ADMIN01'. The process has been terminated.
 
 Details on the alert are below:
 Description: A process attempted to delete a Volume Shadow Snapshot. Host name: STJ-ADMIN01
 File name: cplusplus.exe File path: \Device\HarddiskVolume3\ESS SIMS Connected\Software\cplusplus.exe Command line: cplusplus.exe Platform: Windows IP address: 213.249.229.214 User name: AzureAD\AzureADDeviceLocalAd Detected: Feb. 6, 2024 12:30:39 local time, (2024-02-06 12:30:39 UTC) 
 The process is associated with the 'ESS SIMS Connected'. Is a software used to manage SIMS servers by moving all their SIMS data to the cloud. That means that all of your SIMS functionality can be securely accessed by school staff on a range of internet-connected devices and platforms. The associated hash has been recognised as clean as no security vendor has flagged it as malicious.
 
 Could you please confirm this activity and if this is software used within your environment.

Subject: Laptop and Admin Computers

Good morning.

Please can I raise a couple of queries with you.


  1.  Ros Branton had use of a laptop to work on.  She has now left the school - do you require the laptop back?  We have a laptop in our store cupboard which I think was hers, but I'm not sure.
  2.  The two admin PCs in the office:  One of the keyboards does not appear to be working - I swapped it with the one I am currently using , but I've tried connecting it via all three usb ports on the PC Tower, but it doesn't seem to be recognising it, so I don't know whether its actually working or its just not recognising it.

This PC, that I'm currently using,  is running incredibly slowly and this keyboard has lots of sticking keys.

Please can someone come out to discuss/have a look at for me?

Thanks

Margaret Seager


Kind regards,

had to change my password yesterday, as it had expired. When I try to sign

,T20240206.0053,Word Templates,"Hi,

Not sure if it's ok to ask for help with this but I've tried googling and
looking at tutorials and what I see isn't what they suggest.

I've created a file to use as a template. I've saved it as a .dot file.

When I do File>new the tutorials suggest I should see an option called
'personal' where I can select a new document from my template but I'm just
not seeing this.

I can refind my template (I've pinned it) but this doesn't feel like the
right way of doing things and it defaults to saving it as a .dot file
rather than a .doc file.

Any ideas?

Many thanks

We have an issue with parents calling back after receiving an unanswered
call from our attendance team, whereby if the parent opts to call back the
number they've been rung by, instead of ringing back to millthorpe it rings
through to Carey in the central team, or someone at Woodthorpe Primary
School. We had a similar issue before which was resolved, so hopefully
someone will remember what you did last time!

Many thanks

 Thank you for confirming. 
 
 When it comes down to the exclusion implemented by CrowdStrike, if you don't mind actioning the same on the sever again, to ensure that exclusion is working as expected.
 
 Once that is confirmed, we will keep that until told otherwise.

Can you look at Alisdair's email account and send him a new temporary
password so he can gain access to his account and re-set the password. Once
this is done, the email forwarding should be cancelled as this negates the
security of having Ebor email addresses. If Alisdair talks to his clerk she
will be able to notify him when there is new mail in his ebor email address.
Thank you

Dear Wendy,

Are you in a position to tell me what Google email account you are using to
contact me?

This request to setup 2FA may reveal an existing can of worms regarding my
lack of access to a particular Google account. If it is the account in
question, the only reason I get your emails is because I had previously set
up a forwarder on that account, to send mail to 'mail@trackways.net'. The
reason for my being shut out is unclear—suddenly my password was no longer
accepted.

Regards, Alisdair Laird.

Good afternoon
Cyber-crime is regrettably on the increase and the education sector has not
been spared from what can be devastating IT attacks. The consequence of
such random, malicious activity can be considerable cost, both financially
and in terms of hours or days spent restoring systems.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is now commonplace as a defence,
especially in online shopping and banking. Security fobs and, increasingly,
mobile phone apps tend to be used to provide that additional layer of
security. Put simply, using MFA on all our email accounts will ensure that
whenever someone tries to use your email login from a different machine to
your normal machine/telephone, the system will refuse access unless you
authenticate the access.

MFA will not completely stop the determined cyber attacker but by requiring
additional information as an extra layer of protection, it is proving
highly effective in minimising the attacks. An American security website
suggests it can cut attacks by as much as 80-90%.

Many governors will be aware that school staff all now have MFA on their
google accounts. We now wish to extend this to all governors.  LGB Chairs
have piloted this for us. Guidance on how to do this is attached.

Any initial issues should be directed to help@vitalyork.com but please copy
me in so I can be aware of any problems you are having. The Chairs I have
spoken to have all managed it without an issue so I am hoping it will be
straightforward for you

Wendy

,T20240205.0214,WiFi Issues,"Hi there,

I've swapped to a new phone recently, and I'm having quite a few issues
trying to connect to our WiFi. I can't seem to connect to the Hotspot with
my credentials (I think this could possibly be because my new phone is
lacking a ""Do not Validate"" option for CA Certificates, but no matter what
combinations I try, I never seem to connect.

The guest network seems to be incredibly temperamental when I move between
access points. I seem to lose internet for a reasonably long time, and
often get thrown into limited connection stopping me from getting online
without returning to the point I connected at and fath around trying to get
the device to reconnect again.

Additionally, although not completely breaking, when I initially connect to
the guest network and enter in my voucher code, I usually get a too many
redirects error, and I have to click ""Use network as is"" in order to
continue, though by that point it looks like I am authorised and can use
the network.

Is there anything I can do about this?

Thanks,

I thought this was fixed in Nursery when you replaced a wire?

Will you take a look pls?

Thanks

Hi Matt

Maddy & Christine are still having internet issues.  I'm having to do their
registers and parentpay on a morning.  I really don't mind but it's very
frustrating for the ladies.  The internet is intermittent and no pattern as
to when it's available.  Vital come and have a look and just say they have
slow internet.

Sorry to bother you with this, but I'm not sure what the solution is or if
there is one.  Its causing issues every day for the ladies and it's
frustrating for them.

Hayley - I'm not sure if you have issues too?

Thanks Kay

,T20240205.0095,Query Epic Books App,"Morning

We have some funding for a child that is to be spent on an app called 'Epic
Books' to enable them to download and read books at home. Our query is,
would we be able to purchase the app through Vital and then have it
downloaded onto the pupils personal mobile phone (iPhone) for them to
access and read at any time they are not in school and also, would they be
able to use their google account on a personal device out of school as well
as in school or would all of the above have to be done on a school
chromebook managed by you?

Hope that all makes sense!

Thanks

Subject: Discontinuation of Creative Cloud Synced files

You don't often get email from adobe@info.adobe.com<mailto:adobe@info.adobe.com>. Learn why this is important<https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification>
Adobe is discontinuing the Creative Cloud Synced files feature for business customers beginning 1 October 2024.  ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌  ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌  ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌  ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌
[Adobe]
Dear Creative Cloud Administrator,

Adobe is modernising the Creative Cloud storage experience and
will begin discontinuing Creative Cloud Synced files for business customers under Creative Cloud for Teams and Creative Cloud for Enterprise plans.

Creative Cloud Synced files is general-purpose cloud storage and sync that consists of a local folder on users’ device(s), a background process that creates synchronised copies of those files in Creative Cloud storage and file/folder sharing. This service is separate from Adobe Cloud Documents, Cloud Libraries, Lightroom cloud storage and Frame.io cloud storage – none of which are impacted by this change.

Beginning 1 February 2024

Users will no longer be able to share files or folders from Creative Cloud Synced files with new users outside of your organisation, sharing will continue to work within your organisation until 1 October 2024.

Beginning 1 October 2024

We will begin discontinuing the Creative Cloud content synchronisation process, as well as synced file and folder sharing, and permanently delete the cloud-based copies of files for business customers and their end users.

Assets in the local Creative Cloud Files folder on user devices will no longer be synchronised with Creative Cloud storage. User files will remain intact in their local Creative Cloud Files folder.

Folders and assets previously shared from Creative Cloud Synced files will no longer be accessible to others including inside your organisation as well as externally.

Recommended actions:

It is recommended that you inform the users in your organisation about this upcoming change. In addition, make sure that your organisation's assets are safely backed up either locally, to a separate Adobe-supported cloud storage solution or to third-party cloud storage. Adobe will not be sending out notifications regarding this change directly to your organisation's users.
You can read more about this change and managing your files here<https://adobeint-mid-prod13-t.adobe-campaign.com/r/?id=haa06a101,d481903f,8003e1cc>.

Adobe’s Customer Support organisation is available to answer any questions.

Regards,

Adobe Creative Cloud Team

Simon Riley has told me that he is expecting 10 teams tomorrow for the
maths feast in the TT centre.
So could we have 10 groups of tables set out with 5 seats around each table
please?

There will be a screen in the TT centre for students to view a slide or
two. I don't know where Lee intends to place the screen (So i have cc'ed
him into the email).

Would it also be possible to place some cones outside the TT centre to
reserve spaces for the 2 or 3 minibuses that will be bringing students
please?

Many thanks,

Dan

Hi,

Hope you are well. I've questioned why Lloyds been given a code in English
for missed reading and it's come to my attention that he still doesn't have
his iPad repaired. This issue has been going on for literally months now
yet I'm still paying for something that we don't have. I understand that
the serial numbers for some reason don't match however if he's been sent a
new replacement iPad in the past, there must be a record of this new serial
number. I understand that Lloyd is constantly borrowing a school iPad which
is obviously appreciated however nothing is resolving the issue of where
his iPad actually is. I know I've spoken with reception in the past months
numerous times as they have tried numerous times also to resolve this yet
still have come to a blank. It doesn't make sense that I'm paying for an
item that doesn't now exist.
Shall I just cancel this direct debit as there's nothing to show for it. I
know this may not resolve his English codes however this is what has
brought yet again to my attention.

Thanks

Laura

I was using the Remote Desktop last night and it glitched/froze and ended
up moving the food folder I was trying to open into the MFL folder. I tried
to move it back but it said permissions were needed.
I went on later last night and open documents in the food folder. I have
gone on this morning to do some more work and now half the files have
gone missing but I don’t understand why.

Please could you look into this?

There is a problem with the standalone PC in the upstairs hall.  Sound does
not play when it is connected to external speakers.  We have tried it with
2 different speakers and have checked that the lead is functioning properly
which it is as I was able use it to connect to the speakers from my laptop.
This is a problem for anyone conducting assemblies upstairs of which there
are 2 a week that require the speakers so if someone could take a look asap
that would be great.

I think there is a fault with the fan in my computer. It has been loud

At Scarcroft Primary School, we wish to encourage staff to have a healthy
work-life balance, and therefore we discourage the sending of emails
outside of the traditional working day. Where emails are received after
6pm, over the weekend or during a holiday period, it is likely that a
response will be given during the school’s normal working hours. Thank you
in advance for your understanding in helping us to promote a happy, healthy
and productive workforce.

information and work from there onto the 'onefile' platform we are moving
to.

We need two ebor email addresses setting up as onefile ones will be

,T20240202.0111,Remote supervision/ Computer control,"Good afternoon,

We are setting up a computing qualification and wish to be able to install
some kind of teacher control so that when students are needing to face the
front, the teacher has the ability to lock the student computers remotely.
In previous settings this has been available and also systems whereby the
teacher can see what is on the screens of their students.

Do we have that facility on any of our computers at Aspire? If not, how
would we go about organising this so that we can effectively teach using
computers? As you can probably tell from my description above of what I
mean it will not be myself delivering the qualification but we are wanting
to get this set up asap as we intend to deliver Essential digital skills
level 1 after half term.

Many thanks

Got the message below from student who is really struggling with saving work on Teams - vulnerable student, who does not have good access to computer at home, so need to resolve ASAP.

I had re-done my coursework (again), however it still hasn't saved, I didn't get chance to talk to my form tutor this morning so Vital still isn't aware of the issue.  I've taken pictures of the coursework and I had checked that it was saved and on the Teams version but it keeps disappearing, I've tried different computers and checked on my phone but It's not on any of them.

Please could you come to C09 P3 where she can explain/ideally get this resolved.
Cheers

The second hand projector that you gave me last term has started to fade
significantly. This means that the pupils at the back of the room are
complaining that they can not see the board. This has also been brought up
on learning walks that the pupils cannnot see the board. I am spending an
inordinate amount of extra time bolding and enlarging the presentations. In
discussion with Kelly can we please organise a new interactive
board/screen/projector as soon as possible.

Thanks

,T20240202.0015,iPad,"Hi,

Someone came out yesterday to look at an iPad which is doing very weird
things. I have logged onto this device with my google account. When I go to
remove my account from the device, it lets me do this.
When someone else goes to log in with their google email address... it
bypasses passwords and simply logs in with my account.
I showed the Vital man this yesterday, who was equally as stunned and took
the iPad away.
It was on my desk this morning, so I thought ""oooh, maybe it is fixed""  I
logged in, I had to use my microsoft password to log in, it asked me if I
wanted to stay remembered, I said 'no'.... logged in, then removed my
account from device, I get a little confirmation notice that the account
has been removed...I went to sign in as if I were someone else.... same
thing. It bypasses any passwords and is logged in under my google account.

I have even managed my account on my PC and removed myself from the iPad
that way, but it makes no difference.

Any help gratefully received.

Thank you for your time,

Hi,
Just wondering when you had a minute (if you ever have a minute!) you could
see why my visualiser isn't working. I'm sure it's me missing something or
doing something stupid, but if you could get it working I'd appreciate it,
thank you.

Hi Stuart,

I'm finding that the new laptops are effectively back to where the old laptops were in terms of how long it takes for the children to log in, with some kids regularly sitting for 10 or 15 minutes of a 40 minute lesson waiting for Windows to start; additionally, for some reason children in Year 3 seem to have particular problems with connecting to OneDrive, which adds another 5 or 10 minutes before they can open any of their documents. (In my Y3 ICT lesson yesterday, the lesson had finished before Frankey or Karim were able to do anything at all.) I'd really like Vital to see what's happening first hand and comment on whether it's expected behaviour - when are they next planning to come in?

,T20240201.0221,Chromebook Damaged Batteries,"Dear all,
At OLQM, we currently have at least 15 chromebooks with damaged batteries
that have expanded meaning they can no longer be used. I have asked all
teachers to check their chromebook trolleys in case there are others.

I'm concerned about this from a safety point of view, and so have removed
these from classrooms. It is also having an impact on our ability to
deliver our curriculum - computing and other subjects - as some classes
have gone from a 1:1 ratio to 1:4.

I believe this has been logged by a colleague with both Vital and NPCAT,
but I'm unsure whose responsibility or jurisdiction this would be.

Any advice would be much appreciated on how we can move this forward to get
these chromebooks back working again.

*Kerry - the chromebooks are currently on my office desk. Is there anywhere
safer we can put them in the meantime?*

I've asked previously to stop the pop ups on the chrom ebooks.

As soon as children and adults log into the chromebook they have several
pop ups before they can access their own profile.

This is not helpful for young children or children with SEND.

Is it possible to stop them and turn them off.

Hi, please can you ask Vital to sort out this following issue that is still
ongoing.

Every now and then when I go on the internet I get the message on the

It can happen at any time and the only way I can fix it is to restart my
laptop. This is frustrating in the middle of lessons.

,T20240201.0143,Accidentally moved folder in G Drive,"Hi,

At about 12.54 today, I've accidentally moved a folder (it might have been
called Energy but not 100% sure).

I was saving a new file in word and when navigating to find where I wanted
to put it I ended up accidentally picking up and then dropping a folder
somewhere. It copied and then I can't find a way to 'undo move'.

Is there one? Could you look to see what I did because I've now looked
through my folders and can't find what has moved.
I am regularly using my drive and the shared procurement drive.

It moved from the left hand side of the window, where pinned folders
appear.

This has happened a few times for me. I think it's because of the hover
feature where if you hover (for even a tiny amount of time) it then clicks.
I think I'd prefer to turn this off if you could also help me with this.

Many thanks

Helen

Jasmine starts with us on Monday 05/02/24 as a Cover Supervisor.  She is on SIMs as JBG.

Ideally Claire Carr would like her email and log-in details before Monday so that she can issue her Classcharts and SIMS log ins.  Is this possible?  Is this something we need to look at to simplify the process?

Thanks

,T20240201.0101,Estelle's laptop,"Good morning

Please can we have a look into the following for Estelle O'Hara?

Estelle has a new laptop provided by CST.  It does not appear to have a
Microsoft licence on it, and Estelle is having to work on her own personal
laptop to access word, excel and publisher etc. and then transfer these
documents across to her Ebor laptop.  This is not a practical long term
solution for her. Which also leads to the next point to look into please.

Estelle is trying to transfer the Microsoft documents from her personal to
her Ebor laptop via an external hard drive.  This is not being recognised
by the Ebor laptop.  I have explained to Estelle that Vital were disabling
the USB ports on PCs and laptops for cyber security so that no memory
devices were able to transfer data.  I expect this is what the issue is
here.  Can Estelle's laptop USB port be temporarily enabled to ensure she
can access the documents she needs until the Microsoft licence issue is
resolved please?

Thanks
Laura

Please can we meet tomorrow to talk about chromebooks as the current system
is not working well. I know yourself and Giles had planned to mark the CB's
and have a better system this year so I think now we need to put that into
practice and look at usage. Just let me know what suits you best timewise.

Thanks

Hi Everyone,

Susie Raimes has kindly offered to do a chrome book amnesty in the library
after school on Friday.

Please could you make arrangements to get your trolley to the library at
the end of the day.
The staff currently with bookings and therefore responsible for returning
the trolley somewhere are PB, TM, PW, EH, DR, BC.

If any staff have any loose chrome books then please get these to the
library for the end of the day as well.

We're basically halfway through the school year and the system is chaotic
right now with chrome books missing and trolleys all over the place
sometimes.
We can try to get it in order for the next half of the year so it benefits
us all.

Thanks!

Google and Yahoo have updated their guidelines for sending communications
to their email addresses. These changes aim to improve the overall security
and reliability of their email services. However, these changes may impact
how emails from SaaS providers like Docebo are received by users.



Docebo already covers these requirements if SPF and DKIM are properly
configured in the platform. If you have not completely configured your
platform email settings and you are using the “Notification” or
“Newsletter” features of Docebo to send communications to learners with “
gmail.com” or “yahoo.com” email addresses, these changes could affect your
platform.



To ensure your communications are not identified as spam by Google or
Yahoo, there are certain steps you may need to take. These steps, and the
full details behind these changes, can be found in the community post

,T20240201.0035,Re: SEN IPad printing issues,"Good morning,

With regard to my request yesterday highlighting the SEN iPad not printing I would like to confirm it is still not printing. When the engineer came in yesterday I was not in class and I think he has looked at the class iPad with red case instead of the BLUE SEN one.

I would be grateful if you could  have another look at our Blue iPad when you are next in school.

Many thanks

Hi Dan,

We are currently using  a blue SEN iPad to print quick photos for evidencing work.  Recently we have been having problems with connecting to follow me print  and the size of print choice has changed also.

Please could you have a look at the iPad for me when you are next in school.

Hi Craig

I have been advised that when a parent has tried to email Attendance via
the link on the website, they received the attached bounce back.
I double checked the email address and it is now correct (previously
incorrect), so not sure if there is an issue when being emailed from
outside the Trust?
Any ideas?

Thank you

Hello Debbie,



I am reaching out on behalf of Microsoft as part of your renewal team to
remind and assist you in the upcoming expiration of your Microsoft license
agreement with “FISHERGATE PRIMARY SCHOOL”



My goal is to help you: understand your renewal options, work together to
ensure your technology plans are being met, and align with your partner
to process everything in a timely manner.



*Your next steps: *

   1. Have you already started conversations with your partner for your
   renewal?
   2. I would like to make a brief call with you to discuss your options to
   improve your licensing and optimize costs in your following period, answer
   any questions before renewing, as well as review valuable resources that
   Microsoft has available for your renewal.
   3. Would you be able to share your direct phone, for me to connect with
   you and go over the renewal details?
   4. Is there a time that would be best for you? If you have any preferred
   time slot, feel free to book with me using Microsoft Bookings Thank you for
   your time, and I look forward to hearing back.

I have tried replacing the bulb in the above projector in Classroom 1NK,
however I am struggling to get the new bulb in. It looks identical to the
old one, but does not seem to clip into place. I can replace the old one
with ease and remove it again.
Please can you arrange an engineer to replace. It may be worth bringing a
spare bulb, just in case the new one is faulty.
Many thanks,
Carl.

it would be really useful if Clifford could have an account set up, to
allow him to access edulink and be able to print. This would also support
the department.

Could this be set up please?

I am getting increasingly frustrated with attaching files which I have edited. It happens with the quiz, with my bulletin etc.
What happens is I finish my bulletin, I then go on to emails and attach the bulleting as a copy (not a link). Then I open it and see some of the formatting has changed. I then remove the attachment.  Then I go onto the document, change what I wasn't happy about and then attach it again. The new attachment is still the old one. I have gone off the tab and back on it, I have shut down the email and started it again, I have waited (hoping it just needs time to update) and that doesn't work.
What am I doing wrong please? I am wasting a lot of time trying to get a decent version sent!
Thank you

Hi Mr P,

Thank you for your e-mail. In this case, please double-check that the same
account that you are logging in to Trelson with, has been added by an
account which is already an administrator (in Trelson-configuration) for
your existing organization. When you are added (through the option
""Organizational roles"" on the left side menu, admin alternatives), this
will resolve both parts of the query (templates are also only available to
accounts added as Trelson-admins by an existing admin).

For the Trelson organization hopelearningtrust.org, these are the existing

 Most likely due to nature sensitive nature of the operation, involving the vssadmin.exe process, CrowdStrike does not allow an exclusion being implemented, unless it is made through them. In this case, we would have to contact them to create the exclusion themselves, which we did. We are now waiting for their confirmation.
 
 Please let us know how long you would want this active for, and also if this is going to be an ongoing process going forward, so we can know what would be the best approach in this scenario.

,T20240131.0173,headteacher@ email address/domain/Google account in Naburn,"Hello Vital,

Naburn are in the process of migrating 'headteacher' things from Jonathan
to Kate, as part of the transition process.

The CYC email side of things has been sorted out, I believe.

Kate already has a Windows domain/google account with the relevant
permissions, mrsdurham/mrsdurham@naburnschool.com

Jonathan has always used the headteacher/headteacher@naburnschool.com
Windows domain/google account which he inherited from Mrs Christison to log
on to his laptop, although the email address has never been publicised, as
he (like Brenda used to) basically used the CYC email as his email account.
Obviously all of his work, profile, saved information, shortcuts etc are
stored under that 'headteacher' account and it is going to make his life
very complicated if that changes!

To avoid confusion, would it be possible to update at least the display
name? I don't quite know what was done in terms of renaming/aliases etc
last time around when, from what I remember, the previous head's account
got removed/restored/renamed in some way or another after you were told
about Brenda leaving and the school then realised that they still needed a
login - and access to her docs etc - for Jonathan.

The ideal, probably, would be to keep the username but update the Display
Name, directory listing, and email address.... not sure if that is possible
without breaking things though! Call me if clarification needed?

Thanks
Kat

Hi Mr P,

Thank you for your e-mail. In this case, please double-check that the same
account that you are logging in to Trelson with, has been added by an
account which is already an administrator (in Trelson-configuration) for
your existing organization. When you are added (through the option
""Organizational roles"" on the left side menu, admin alternatives), this
will resolve both parts of the query (templates are also only available to
accounts added as Trelson-admins by an existing admin).

For the Trelson organization hopelearningtrust.org, these are the existing
Trelson administrator accounts:

I don't know if this is something you can help with, but my personal laptop
seems to have gone kaput. I'm worried it may have a virus or something.
It's a Huawei. The only two options it gives me when I now turn it on are
'troubleshoot', whivh leads to nothing... Or shut down.
Is this something you can help me with?

When we do our speaking exams in MFL, we normally upload them to the 'data' section of our MFL P drive. It looks as though the rest of the department don't have access to the new version on Teams. Could you add them please, or is it a deliberate management choice to only allow subject leaders to access this?

Thanks,
Sarah

,T20240130.0225,Re: FAM - Off site direction - Lilly Anne Kinder,"Hi,

Please see notes from a meeting with Lillyanne Kinder, gran, Gaynor, and
Head of Year at Millthorpe below.

*Actions from meeting*:

- Lillyanne will be starting on Monday.
- *Katie *- please can this be added to SIMS?
- *Alexis*, please can she be issued a timetable? I think she may have to
go into A band based on the space we have - if there is space however, D
band, French, would be better for relationships and language. Please can
she also be factored into Options? She thinks she wants to do
Graphics/Child Development.
- *Simone* - she will have trousers/shirt/shoes hopefully. We will provide
a tie/jumper and she will need a PE kit too. Would you be able to put some
things aside for her and we can pass on? She is PP/FSM.
- *Yr team* - she has not yet had a tour/planner/TT etc so I have asked Rob
if he can spend Monday P1 setting her up, showing her key areas and doing
any troubleshooting. Gran wants to bring her in on her first day and will
bring her in for 8:30am.
- *IT *- once she is on SIMS please can she have a Google classroom/IT
login?


*Information about Lillyanne:*

- Must be *Lillyanne*, not Lilly - she gets annoyed at being called this.
- Difficult home life. Mum disabled and bed/wheelchair bound. Mum is very
volatile and can be aggressive on the phone. HofY advised call gran
wherever possible, and mum in afternoons after pain meds have kicked in if
we have to.
- Lillyanne moved in with gran 3 weeks ago and moving forward will be with
gran during the weekdays. HofY said she is like a different child since
this happened. Gran is really desperate to support and wants to work with
us.
- Lillyanne is a young carer of gran at home.
- Lillyanne is youngest of 6. Matty (Y11) was with her and mum. He also
struggles and accessing alternate provision. Lillyanne loves Matty and
affected if anything goes wrong with him. 4 older siblings (youngest age
20) as well as Matty, all moved out of home.
- She is on free school meals
- Lillyanne finds it difficult to make friends, but already knows and is
friendly with Karla Horrocks, Ellie Mason and Lily-May Hartley at AHS.
- Studies French atm but we talked about there potentially not being room
in this band.
- Likes English, Food tech, Maths. Dislikes drama but won't be on her TT
here - spoke about English enrichment not involving drama currently.
- No sports/hobbies she could point to but likes hair/makeup
- Lillyanne articulated that her main issues have stemmed from associating
with negative influences, messing around, lates.
- After Lillyanne left, HofY disclosed the main reason for suspensions is
verbal abuse of staff. She stressed that Lillyanne must be left alone to
cool off if there are issues - when staff try to intervene she blows up.
Other reason is walking out of Reflection which is an instant suspension at
Millthorpe. Terrible language used which is modelled by mum at home.
- Low self-confidence - has been part of a workshop to address this at
Millthorpe
- Needs to be in control of her work/perfectionist. Has good effort scores
on reports. Will highlight everything, tear out pages and rewrite them if
they aren't neat enough. Wants to do well.
- Has attachment issues and may try to hug staff if she forms a connection;
has attempted this with HofY at Millthorpe. HofY described her 'just
wanting another parent'
- No SEN, but weak due to gaps in learning primarily.
- No specialist provision at Millthorpe beyond support from yr team.

Thanks,
Jessa

,T20240130.0221,Supported Recruitment - Carr Junior,"Hi Russ

Rich Robinson (Supported Recruitment) has spoken to Russ previously about
wifi on Carr Junior site.

Are they able to be put on the wifi but not access any of our drives /
documents? They have chromebooks to use on site and will be here on
Thursday from 9.30am ish if someone could put them on the internet?

When you are completing the full infrastructure can Classroom 3 (classroom
next to canteen) be separated?

Hope this makes sense!

Thank you

Please could I raise a ticket for FOG pupil logins being blocked from
accessing the RWInc portal? Links can be copied to the Google Classroom,
but pupils cannot play the videos. Pupils at other Trust schools(e.g NSJ)
can access these videos independently on their devices. This is negatively
affecting the quality of education for our most vulnerable learners.

Many thanks,

Sara

Hi Sara,

Thanks so much for your email and for raising SH being in class on a Mon +
Tues. As Mrs Martin covers EYFS these days it would be down to an adult
setting up (on their own login) the portal as when the children log in on
theirs the portal does not load the videos. I have spoken to vital and
Corinne about this before and it seems that the portal only works if an
adult logs in first. Would this be tricky in regards to GDPR?

Happy to accommodate and in the best interests of SH help to make this
work. Mrs Martin is happy to set up a chrome book on a Monday and Tuesday
with the portal open but there are concerns that she might access something
unintentionally.

Many thanks,

Georgina

I have copied Mrs Stansfield and Mr Hay in this email as hopefully one of
them will be able to send a link for Dictate Pro. I have an email from
Holly (Craig)
asking for the link as she is unable to find the app. I will create a PO
once it is confirmed that the app is available to purchase at £12.99

Thanks
Adele

If you could let me know once it's set up and what it's called, that would
be great.

it would seem sensible to get rid of it. We do however have a Projects

to be for John Stone, Marie Townsley, me and then the news Director of

Hi Oliver,

Attached is the photo of my computer. It's very slow, freezes every time I
use it and the screen will go blank when I have too many tabs open (5 at
most).

Thanks,

ipads that we got from Vital - one trolley of 30 children's and 10 new
staff iPads. It's a spreadsheet with 4 tabs on the bottom - iPads,
Chromebooks, Windows hardware and Screens and Projectors. Is it possible to
get an updated version of the inventory?

Just a quick query... is there any chance the projector could be moved to the main whiteboard in B02? I appreciate this is not a simple task and there may be a reason in maths why the projector beams into the corner - if so then no probs (thats why I have copied you maths gents in).

My Y7 form really struggle to read powerpoints (M3, behaviour curriculum etc) or see embedded videos and so on, from its current vantage point.

Thought it was worth an ask.

Please can I raise a couple of queries with you.


  1.  Ros Branton had use of a laptop to work on.  She has now left the school - do you require the laptop back?  We have a laptop in our store cupboard which I think was hers, but I'm not sure.
  2.  The two admin PCs in the office:  One of the keyboards does not appear to be working - I swapped it with the one I am currently using , but I've tried connecting it via all three usb ports on the PC Tower, but it doesn't seem to be recognising it, so I don't know whether its actually working or its just not recognising it.

This PC, that I'm currently using,  is running incredibly slowly and this keyboard has lots of sticking keys.

Please can someone come out to discuss/have a look at for me?

Thanks

Margaret Seager


Kind regards,

Can someone get in touch regarding progress with sorting our printer - no
staff can currently send to print on the main staff printer, and haven't
been able to do so since prior to Christmas. Also, we have a plethora of
laptops that aren't working and either need replacing and/or recycling.
Would be really helpful if someone could pop in.

I've still not been able to use our printer either - neither from my laptop
or desktop.

Look forward to hearing from you,

As we are approaching the end of the financial year and in order for us to plan for the next one, would it be possible to send over details of a renewal quotation / prices for the next period April 2024 - March 2025.

I believe our current contract ends in April 2024 therefore please can you confirm of any notice period that needs to be provided, alternatively does our contract finish and come to an end at the end of the term.

I look forward to hearing from you.

I had also requested a meeting to look at how we can improve the flow
between apps on the ipads as we are currently not able to upload and share
work from one app to another e.g. edupuppets onto seesaw.  It would be good
if we could get a date in the diary to review this.

seems to be that the ethernet cables are stretched and the plugs are not
connecting.

Can you please look at all of the boxes in which the ethernet cables run
to. Can you ensure that they are long enough and that the cables/boxes
cannot be tugged/moved by cleaners or students in their daily use.

This issue is causing a lot of problems at the start of the lessons.

points (in italics)- I've put queries alongside these, I'd be grateful if
you could advise on the queries please:

*Investigate whether our IT software needs updating or replacing to be more
secure* - can you please confirm that all security updates are applied
automatically and that you would contact us if there were any concerns?


*Put controls in place that are: *

   - *Proportionate: the school will verify this using a third-party audit
   (such as 360 degree safe <https://360safe.org.uk/>) annually to objectively
   test that what it has in place is effective* - are you familiar with 360
   degree safe and is this something you would recommend we use?
   - *Multi-layered: everyone will be clear on what to look out for to keep
   our systems safe*
   - *Up to date: with a system in place to monitor when the school needs
   to update its software - *can you please confirm as above that you would
   let us know if there were any concerns about software updates?
   - *Regularly reviewed and tested: to make sure the systems are as
   effective and secure as they can be* - what checks do you run to check
   security?

Also who manages our firewall, is that you or is that linked to our
internet provider (so NYC)?

,T20240123.0040,MS Surface Computer,"Good Morning,

I have an MS Surface computer which I use as a laptop and inherited from my
predecessor, Alison.  It has become very 'laggy' and I often find when I am
typing that the screen can be up to a line of text behind me.  I also find
when I use a remote keyboard that it misses characters during the lag /
delay period and I end up having to retype documents to avoid sending out
with errors.

I find the ability to detach the keyboard and use the device as a tablet
very useful.  I am reluctant to let it go and swap it for a standard Dell
laptop however it is proving more and more difficult to use.

Is there anything that can be done to rebuild it or reset somehow to speed
it back up again.  Or, do we have anything on range as a replacement which
would be either an updated Surface or a similar machine with the tablet
style option and the compact design.

Grateful for your advice on what is best to do.  I really don't want to
swap for a standard laptop if possible.

Thanks
David

,T20240122.0162,Dye sublimation printer- opportunity to enhance the quality of DT products and a wider school use to raise funds or personalise for new students.,"We have a non functioning dye-sublimation printer (photo enclosed). This
would allow us to print onto a wide range of surfaces with a polymer
content, so any surface that has a plastic finish. Examples; coasters,
t-shirts, baseball hats, drinks bottles etc.
The process works as follows:-

1) Print image using dye-sublimation paper (our printer is not currently
working)
2) Place image on object to receive print
3) Use heat to seal the image onto the object (we already have a specialist
heat press to do this and all the fittings to print onto bottles, mugs,
hats, t shirts etc)

Link below to some products that can be printed on (not endless) just from
one supplier

https://www.techsoft.co.uk/products/image-transfer-accessories/blanks-products-ready-for-sublimation-only


Unfortunately the printer does not at the moment function, I am not sure
why as it has been like that before I arrived here.

I want to get it working or if not look at replacing it.

https://www.techsoft.co.uk/products/image-transfer/sublimation

Just a few ideas to use this dye sublimation process in school


   1. Printing personalised images onto fabric at KS3 for Textiles
   2. Printing onto surfaces to enhance the quality of products for KS4
   3. Raising funds by making personalised items
   4. Year 8 students creating in house designed items for new students or
   September intake.
   5. Setting up mini-enterprise businesses for Business.


Can IT support first please have a look at the printer, to see if it can be
maintained or repaired. We can then go from there. The printer is in G2 by
the whiteboard.




Thanks

,T20240122.0132,Job roles,"Hi,

I've just been chatting in the office and we are noticing that several
staff members do not have their job title showing with their email address.
As well as making it more difficult to find the correct address if you
don't know the full name (or formal name), it also increases the GDPR
risks.

Please could you update the following:

Me - Helen Taylor - really common name! Can my email address be changed to
helen.taylor? or a link to this as well as h.taylor?
My role is Procurement Officer - Central Support Team

Michelle Clarkson - Not sure what her job is and she doesn't have a
signature so I can't check that way.

Ellie Ward - Elana Ward I think on the emails but I was guessing. I think
she is a Finance Business Partner.

Thank you

Could I please ask for an email address to be set up for Jacqui Thompson,
she will be joining us on a self employed basis but will need access to

Also could I also request an email to be created that is

it can only be used by a team of people?

We have received some chromebooks from within the MAT and they need putting
onto our network (getting the network not available) message. There are
also a few with messages on like 'doesn't switch on etc'

We have got rid of a large amount of IPADS, so we have a spare trolley
which I would like to use as a chromebook trolley as we have enough to fill
it. I didn't want to plug them all in without the chargers being in the
right place, is this something that you can sort and cable tidy for us?

I also have around 10 DFE chromebooks that I have never got out of the
boxes, kept in a cupboard for spares in case any break. It would be good to
do a bit of an audit of all the things we have in school now that we are
part of the PMAT IT strategy.

If you could advise, that would be great,

I have a rewire software glitch with Sibelius on machines 13 and 14.
Normally I can log in using local admin mode and just click the repair
button, but it's now greyed out and I can't fix it. It's possibly something
you've not done before so it would be good to look together. Tuesday
1.20-2.20 is a good time as I've got the y11 class in who it relates most
to but they're mostly at college visits tomorrow (if that's convenient for
you)

Ben said that he believed the trust were getting a license for Impero over
Christmas, I was hoping this had arrived? If so could I have it installed
on my computers please? It is an important behaviour management tool and it
also enables students to see code on their screens, so they don't have to
crane their necks all the time.
Thank you in advance.
Kind regards,

Good morning



What does the error message say please?



I’ve attached a guide that should help your IT support install the files.



The files are needed to install on your SIMS  software to connect to the
Orchestra Lite module which is being brought into place to replace B2B etc.



This will help get your schools data into the Synergy module quicker once
the testing phases are complete.

,T20240110.0045,Chromebooks,"Good morning,

Some of our chromebooks are not loading. This wasn't an issue last term but
since coming back, we have 3 (that I know of) that aren't loading to the
sign in page. They display the 'loading' circle, which spins round for a
few minutes. It then brings up the internet page, saying something went
wrong, then goes back to loading. They are connected to the internet,
according to the device, and I've tried turning them off and on multiple
times. I think this is an issue in the other Year 3 class too.

Kind regards,

Eliza Bates

,T20240109.0246,New VM and Firewall Rules,"Hi Liam / Vijay

Hope Sentamu Learning Trust have a requirement for a new Academia hosted server. This server will be pulling information from all the SIMs servers in the Trust in order to upload it to M365 to produce PowerBI reports.

This request is 2-fold. Firstly, please can you provision a new VM running Windows server. Essentially all this will do is be a file server and sync data to SharePoint. So, it’s CPU / Memory and Storage requirements will be minimal. Regarding VLAN placement, it can go along side HSLT-APPS01 (10.220.1.132).
Secondly, this server will need to some new firewall rules creating so it can receive the files from the SIMS servers. I image this will only require SMB. The SIMS server are on the following IP addresses:
ASA-SIMS 10.18.212.19
ASP-SIMS01 10.220.1.140
BHS-SIMS 10.220.1.130
GPS-SIMS 10.220.1.131
MCE-SIMS 10.18.208.18
NSJ-SIMS01 10.220.1.138

,T20231221.0027,Chrome books not charged / missing / real mess,"Hi Jimmy.

The chrome book situation is a real issue - it has hugely been affecting
lessons and learning time. I yesterday tried to do a coursework lesson with
my GCSE year 10s and after 30 minutes I finally got the whole class on a
chrome book to start on their coursework. Half were not working, out of
charge and lack of chrome books in a trolley. Tried to scrabble around to
get what i needed

In the long term we really need a sustainable solution and some
accountability with support to ensure we can get the trollies and be able
to use them straight away each lesson. I know we discussed a plan that you
have over christmas so i hope things will see some distinct change in
January.

less)

Now I think it has sent it to print the printer toner is full or
incorrectly placed.

*Please can the science printer be looked at as an urgent job?*

Thank you

,T20230927.0277,Single sign on from iTrent to Staff Learning Hub,"Hello

I know that you are working on getting SSO into each school but wondering
if the following information would help with getting the link from iTrent
to Staff Learning Hub working?

If Rob remembers he attended the initial LMS IT infrastructure call on 27th
April this year with MHR.

Thank you

*SSO*

Should you wish to use Single Sign-on as an authentication method for the
LMS, your protocol of choice is likely to be SAML which has already been
activated on the platform. Bear in mind we are waiting on iTrent user
provisioning/maintenance to be in place before we can action this phase of
the LMS project (SSO), please just find the information below regarding
configuring SSO for when the time is suitable.

   - *SAML 2.0 protocol* (intro article
   <https://www.docebo.com/knowledge-base/introduction-to-docebo-for-saml/>
   , standard config article <https://www.docebo.com/knowledge-base/saml/>)
   - supports both SSO and user provisioning and works for Microsoft ADFS (ADFS
   article
   <https://www.docebo.com/knowledge-base/enabling-sso-docebo-microsoft-adfs/>),
   Microsoft Azure AD B2B (though the Azure AD Connect optional module is
   needed), Microsoft Azure AD B2C, Okta and many other IdPs. – *Note it’s
   likely you’ll be using the standard configuration option*

I have been sent a password reset for this app, but after I have done this and re logged in on my chrome book, it is still telling me that our subscription has expired, but as you can see from the screen shot below, we have 1096 days left

Do you think it would be best for it to be uninstalled and re installed to see if it brings the correct licencing information across as I can't log in with the details provided and we need to have this up & running for Monday as we have a training session booked with NYCC

Many thanks for looking into this for us
