,T20230428.0056,Speaker in school,"Hi Mike


Can you just advise me on what to do.  I have a speaker coming in for a
workshop on the 11th May, we are using the library.  He needs to use a
laptop/computer to show a video.  Does he use a school laptop or bring his
own laptop?

If he uses a school one how does it work regarding logging in and
accessing his things?


Thanks,
Sam

,T20230427.0152,Sandy log in,"Good Afternoon,

Further to the email I sent earlier today.

Sandy was originally with us and had the login s.pidd then she left. She
then returned to us and had a different email created (
s.pidd1@danesgatecommunity.org.uk). Should her username to login to the PC
be s.pidd or s.pidd1?.

I believe she was able to login with the username s.pidd and the new
password you changed earlier. But she now cannot login to her emails. (This
is so much more complicated than it needs to be)

So I think if you reset the password for s.pidd1 (If this is the username
so should use) she can then use this account and her emails will be sorted.

I hope you can make sense of that.

Cheers,

Sam

,T20230427.0145,Software update for PaperCut on server,"Hi,

Sorry for another email...

Paul at Agilico, who supply our copiers, has phoned to say that there's an
error showing at their end because an update needs to run on the Paper Cut
software on the server.  He said if you login to Papercut on the server
then go to the advanced tab and check for updates that should sort it.
Hopefully that means more to you than me! His direct number if there's any
queries is 0191 814 5202.

I did check whether this might be linked to the people who were having
issues printing, but he said not.

Thanks
Carrie

I'm hoping you can help - I've had various conversations with Talk Straight
to try to get a website unblocked (for pupils & staff) and to get me access
to their portal set up, but it's not working as it should.  The chap I've
been speaking to - Eshwesh - thinks that he needs to speak to you/have a
remote session to try to work out what's going on.  He was going to try to
do a remote session with me, but he said he needed me to set that up and
download TeamViewer etc, which I don't know how to do, but he then said it
was probably you he needed to speak to. Would one of you be able to give
him a call on 0113 322 2333, customer services option (I think that was
1).  The ticket ref is 351677.

,T20230427.0037,Aspire Printing and exam Issues,"Morning,
We have an iGCSE exam on Wednesday (in fact we are running functionals
every day at the moment as well). We still cannot print from SIMS, despite
technicians attending 1 day this week, and with no time scale for IF and
when this will be resolved.

In addition, we have been chasing exam laptops for some time. The solution
today was they can be dropped off here some time Tuesday or we can send
someone to Vale to collect them today. Neither option is suitable quite
frankly.  There has been plenty of notice given for this - we are not in a
position to lose a staff member for 4 hours today and Tuesday is far too
late to ensure the work and set up correctly to go - particularly given the
new system in place for exam laptops and assigning them to students. I am
not sure why these couldn't have been delivered when technicians attended
this week.

The workload for this and all exams is immense, and currently greater due
to our ongoing printing and other IT issues. We have just 3 admin staff to
cover all areas (including reception, progress, data and exams). Some of
our upcoming exams have 140 students in them! This is not sustainable for
our exam season without serious knock on effect to the quality of provision
and communication for the rest of the school.

Could we please have a reasonable resolution and timeframe for both exam
laptops and printing from SIMS as soon as possible.

Kind regards
Stacey

Good evening,

Unfortunately, I have been having issues with my smart board this afternoon. The screen keeps showing a no signal diagram and I've made sure cables are all plugged in, turned it off and on etc. Now I can't seem to get my computer on either! I'm pressing the button and nothing is happening.

Thank you,
Ash


Also the smartboard next to that classroom is reporting the following

Good morning Stuart,

I wondered if you knew how to change the colour settings on the computer. On my desktop the colour is correct but on the interactive board the colour becomes very pale and hard to see.

Thank you,

Hi Kirstie,

I’ve just updated Oli but I thought I’ll dump some info here so you are kept up to speed.

Staff with printing issues Oli now has the knowledge to resolve. It’s a simple fix, but one that I can’t do remotely easily so Oli has kindly agreed to do for me. Thanks again by the way! Essentially it is a group policy issue (group policy decides based on who you are/what device you’re using what you are allowed to have access to at Applefields etc) where it has not updated on some user profiles, this happens occasionally when group policy is updated as it’s not guaranteed to pull the new policies. To fix, you can restart x2 or Oli has a command he can run that will force it to update.

Scanning is also a relatively easy fix but myself and David are still working on it. The addresses PaperCut has pulled to use are your old email addresses. We just need to update all of the addresses to your Google Mail accounts so it scans to the correct emails. I’m waiting on David as we need to figure out where we put the new addresses to populate into PaperCut without removing the old ones from the original system as that could cause issues with Microsoft.

By all means give me a call when you’re back off your break Kirstie if you’d like me to run through things over the phone, sometimes easier to get the info across 😊

Sorry about the initial teething problems we’re having!

Thanks,
Joe

Hi all,

I can’t see anything server wise that would be causing an issue.

Kirstie – I’ll email Pauline separately and try organise a remote session on the affected user / device and see if we can figure out what’s happening. If we can fix on one, we’ll do each other affected user as they’re coming up. Are we confident the vast majority of the school are able to print and it seems to be just these few users?

Hi Tracey,

I think there might be something wrong with my phone. It keeps ringing and
then cutting off. It was doing it yesterday too. Do you know if there is a
problem with it? Also people may be trying to get through to me so may ring
you instead - just so you know.

The projector in L40 is still turning itself off periodically during
lessons - please can this be looked at as a matter of urgency now.

Also I appear not to be in the Music email group - please can I be added!

There is no sound coming out of the speakers on one of the Macs in L40 -
the MIDI keyboard works fine, but there is no sound from the Mac to the
speakers.

,T20230426.0005,iTrent - new payroll system,"Hi

We have gone live with our new payroll system iTrent as from 01/04/2023,
providers MHR.

I mentioned to the consultant that our system was very slow, so he asked me
to get our IT providers to check the VPN? as that may be slowing things
down.

Hopefully that will mean something to you.

Thanks in advance.

number of them missing, especially from trolley 1. We were in a good
position prior to Christmas so I'd imagine that the reason for the missing
chromebooks was due to the use of them following the cyber attack. Please
can I have an amnesty of the return of any CB's that you may have borrowed
and I'd like them all returned by COP Friday. If you still have an IT issue
that requires you to still use a CB please let Vital know so that we can
account for all of the missing units.

Hi Paula,

Not sure what I've managed to do, but It won't let me change the permissions for ""p.edwards@"". However as you can see ""P Edwards"" has full access!

Fear I may have made this more complex than intended...

Any suggestions greatly appreciated.

Hi Jonathan,

I know things are a bit tight at the moment, but I wondered if myself and Kelly could have an extra phone (and number) for our office. It's quite a pastoral role and we often need the phoe at the same time so sharing isn't really practical.

Thanks

Our headteacher has a new PA. Would you be able to change the details on
her phone accordingly.

The number is 3404 and her name is Helen Mackley so could you replace
Claire Hardware with Helen Mackley.

I also noticed that there was an extra space between the apostrophe and ""s""
in headteacher's could you correct that aswell.

Kind regards

,T20230425.0040,PC Crashing,"Good morning,

Would it be possible for an engineer to come and look at our 5H classroom
as soon as possible?

The PC keeps crashing. It brings up a blue screen with an error message and
needs rebooting to be able to restart. This has been reported before and
the PC has been replaced.
This is becoming more frequent and as I am sure you can understand is quite
a disruption when teaching a class, hence the urgency.

Thank you

Rebecca

,T20230424.0265,prob with PC in EN7,"once it is going, it is fine, but in the morning it takes several
attempts to start up. The screen often freezes after I have logged in. I
have taken to switching off at the mains before I start it up to try and
prevent this - generally it is better if it has been logged off and shut
down but even this is starting to have less impact.
any advice very welcome. thank you

The key that you need to use with the windows button to extend the screen
is broken on the EN2 keyboard. Can it be switched for one that worked

It is very difficult ty..ing without this letter (which is causing issues

Not sure who is best to ask about this.

Thanks for the update.
Just to say that with the office pcs all the work I have done today has saved directly to the Admin Shared ""O"" drive.
I have had no error message or any redirection.
We have logged out of and turned pcs of since Friday.

Also Eleanor asked me to mention that she too has logged off her pc since Friday.
Thanks
Amanda

Subject: Admin shared/print release in Lord Deramore's


This email originated from outside of the organisation. Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe.

Hello Vital

Lauren in the office contacted me on Friday to say she could no longer save to the shared admin drive, and Eleanor (SBM) has just emailed me to say she has the same problem this am.

I assume that it is because they had/have mapped drived to the old server which, since Friday (afternoon I think) has been made read-only. I've suggested logging off and logging back on to hopefully pick up the updated drive mappings and also sent a screenshot of browsing to \\server093 so that they could at least save anything that they had open to the new server share, but can I check that the drive mapping for the admin share has also had a policy update to force it to point to the new one.

Eleanor also raised a fairly important question - presumably this means that any work they did and saved to these shares last week is on the old server, not the new one? Is there anything you can do to copy those changes across, or do they need to try to do it manually? I don't want people to lose a week's work! It has caused quite a lot of confusion, and I don't want them to lose confidence in the new network at the outset...

One further question - any progress with getting the print release working via server 093 or do I need to get the school to contact the MFD providers? I installed direct print Qs on server093 for lots of people (and sent an all.staff email showing how they could do this) to enable them to have a workaround in the short term, but they REALLY miss the security and cost-savings of the print release system!

I'm not due back in LDs until Thursday, but if you particularly need me to go in to investigate/implement anything I could possibly squeeze a trip in somehow.

Thanks
Kat

I haven't put my head in my hands - I understand that it will be a pain to
have so many accounts!

I have copied in our help desk so they can re-notify you of the ebor
account's details in your name (p.ferguson@ebor.academy) and provide you
with a temporary password so that you can access the drive as and when
required. Worst case scenario, I will be able to send documents password
protected to you if all else fails.

,T20230424.0108,Edulink access,"To whom it may concern,

I am an ITT student in the English department.

This email address was helpfully set up for me to use after Easter in order
to access shared drives and resources such as Edulink. Unfortunately, I
still do not have access to Edulink so am emailing to ask whether it would
be possible for my email to be added to access this resource? This would be
extremely beneficial to my training as I need to be able to access
registers and class data.

I spoke to a technician before Easter who said they would look into this so
am just chasing up this request.

Thank you very much for any help you can provide.

Bit of an urgent one as this has been going on a while and I've been
unaware!

Lydia Desborough is off school for a while and parents want work for her -
I've asked all teachers to put the work on Google Classroom for her.

However, she does not know her log on details for Google Classroom.

Is this something you can help with?! I need to let them know today, Lydia
has an operation tomorrow and parents are on to me

Hoping you can help!

I only found out this morning the science printer had an error. The error
should have been reported via the reprographics portal the first time it
happened and not the third time it happened. If it had, the issue may have
been resolved by now.

Just to update you all the printer needs a new fuser unit. The printer was
showing a H4-00 error. The part may take 2 to 4 days to arrive.

The earlier jobs are logged with reprographics the better.

Since the 22/2/2023 there have only been 4 issues logged with this printer.

,T20230421.0077,Learning Management implementation - IT support,"Good morning

We are putting in a new training system linked with the iTrent HR/Payroll
system. They have asked for a member of our IT team to attend a meeting
next week Friday 29th April 10.00 - 11.00am to talk about the IT
infrastructure.

Would you be able to point me in the right direction of the best person at
Vital to help?

iTrent have said the person needs to have someone who has knowledge on
Single sign on, SSL certificates, whitelisting and custom domain.

The notes they have attached to the meeting invite as as follows

Custom Domain Currently the LMS is accessible via the
mhr-ebora.docebosaas.com
<https://www.google.com/url?q=http://mhr-ebora.docebosaas.com&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1682496457925543&usg=AOvVaw10k4L33MlwV-6k_l1CZSDP>
URL but this is likely to be replaced with a custom domain name. You’ll
need to decide what this will be (e.g. learning.ebor.academy,
mylearning.ebor.academy etc) but once determined you will be required to:
1. Carry out the relevant DNS configuration changes 2. Generate and upload
an SSL Security certificate to the LMS site Please note the sooner we can
get this done the better as some of the LMS platform’s functionality is
reliant on a specific domain name – n.b. this is something that absolutely
must be in place before go-live. Please find further guidance here<

SSO Should you wish to use Single Sign-on as an authentication method for
the LMS, your protocol of choice is likely to be SAML which has already
been activated on the platform. Bear in mind we are waiting on iTrent user
provisioning/maintenance to be in place before we can action this phase of
the LMS project (SSO), please just find the information below regarding
configuring SSO for when the time is suitable. * SAML 2.0 protocol (intro

- supports both SSO and user provisioning and works for Microsoft ADFS
(ADFS article<
https://www.docebo.com/knowledge-base/enabling-sso-docebo-microsoft-adfs/
<https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.docebo.com/knowledge-base/enabling-sso-docebo-microsoft-adfs/&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1682496457925543&usg=AOvVaw0AV3GqmCe0Hwa6z-Y6ek5f>>),
Microsoft Azure AD B2B (though the Azure AD Connect optional module is
needed), Microsoft Azure AD B2C, Okta and many other IdPs. – Note it’s
likely you’ll be using the standard configuration option Allow List/DKIM
Once the custom domain is in place, you may need to carry out a
whitelisting activity if emails from the platform aren’t being delivered.
At the moment this is an FYI only as we won’t know this until we’ve tested
the functionality. We’ll cover this in due course, meanwhile more details
can be found here<

Good morning

I hope all is well.

I appreciate FoG is one of many schools with ongoing issues since the
cyber attack at the beginning of the year, and, on the whole, we're
coping really well without our desktops and scanning facilities.

One thing that is causing problems, however, is not being able to access
the Paxton programme on Steph's desktop so that we can create access
passess to the building.  We initially only set up those required at the
time but now with more visitors and agency staff, we don't have enough.

Can Steph's desktop at least be prioritised, please ?

Thanks
Rachael

Hi ladies,
I'm afraid that I still seem to be having printing issues. The other day, I seemed to be able to print but then my jobs didn't appear on the office printer. That went back to normal but last night, the office printer disappeared off my print list and Alison's printer appeared. It's still the same this morning. I can't print upstairs as it doesn't recognise my code. Please can someone speak to vital to try to sort it out, I'm finding it really stressful!

Thanks for access to your PC to check the Sharp device settings.

We will need your Its input please as looking at the shots below it’s a DNS issue and I am unable to run Command Prompt to check.

Please can you send this to your IT and ask them to confirm the settings in the copier, I can then change whichever is needed to be altered with you and we can test again.

To: J Meehan <j.meehan@huntington-ed.org.uk>
Subject: Paper Cut Vulnerability Update: Active Exploitation

On 6th April we notified you of a critical issue in PaperCut MF & PaperCut NG.
Dear PaperCut User,

On 6th April we notified you of a critical issue in PaperCut MF & PaperCut NG. At the time there was no evidence of activate exploitation. Unfortunately, Konica Minolta has now become aware of multiple instances of this vulnerability being actively exploited.

We are therefore advising all customers that it’s imperative that any installation of PaperCut that’s still effected by this issue be upgraded to a patched version as soon as possible. The email of April 6th contained instructions on the quickest path to upgrade your specific PaperCut installation. Additional information is available here<http://link.konicaminolta.co.uk/Njk3LUdCVi03NTAAAAGLPibvbEDgo9i7nDfid-Rd64Rge9I9hVeODaPgTvsMyh3vwt_U8EhCJUdz3knBxofoIfGdMYg=>.

Its important that all customers assess their own appetite to risk when deciding whether to continue operating vulnerable systems. However, we do strongly advise against any customer continuing to operate a vulnerable PaperCut system that’s accessible to untrusted users (e.g. by being accessible via the internet).

If you believe your unpatched PaperCut system may have been compromised via this vulnerability, please quarantine the PaperCut server(s) immediately and contact our Hotline Team.

If you would like further information, please contact our Hotline Team (on 01268822707 & select Option 4).

Best Regards
Your Konica Minolta Support Team.

*Please Note: these issues do not affect PaperCut Hive, PaperCut Pocket, Print Deploy, Mobility Print, PaperCut Views, or PaperCut client software.

Mr Goodacre and Mrs Starr have tried to complete the authentication but
both have got stuck as their password did not when trying to re-add their
profile .

This is the exact same thing that happened to Hannah.

Please could you advise - others obviously don';t want to try this given it
means they will be unable to log in

Please advise...

Hi Adam,

Shelly and I are continuing to have problems saving work done at home on our chromebooks. On the monitor at school it shows that the windows memory is full. I've tried deleting from it but it says I have to contact the system administrator. Previously, I 've increased the cache memory on both our chromebooks but that makes no differrence.

Any advice hugely appreciated as it is very frustrating when we work at home and then can't access it at school.

Thanks Hazel

Family lives in Darlington, so she will be on a service bus. She
currently goes to Richmond school.

separately)

Hello Mike and Sarah,


The Schools Gigabit Broadband Programme is a Department for Education (DfE) scheme to provide faster broadband for schools.  We think your school may be eligible and we don’t want you to lose the opportunity to be included.   

Your local authority may have posted information about this programme on your school’s bulletin to prepare you for my call.
   
I have attached the following documents for your information, which outline the programme:   
  

  *   PowerPoint slide deck, which introduces the programme,   
  *   A data checklist for completion and return by email.


Alternatively, if you prefer to provide this information via a call, please advise of dates and times you are free, a contact number for the call and I will send you an invite.

The data you need to complete the checklist may be found in your broadband contract or bill.  It may be that you need to liaise with your IT department/person or internet provider.

If you require further information but don’t have time for a telephone call, the link below will take you to the government press release about the programme.
Thousands of rural primary schools to get huge broadband upgrade - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/thousands-of-rural-primary-schools-to-get-huge-broadband-upgrade>

The deadline for the data collection in your region is 28 April 2023, but if you can provide it sooner it would be greatly appreciated.

If you have any questions about the programme, please contact us on:
Schools.FIBRE@education.gov.uk<mailto:Schools.FIBRE@education.gov.uk> 


Kind regards

I do think though it is worth going through the hardware on the contract at some point to ensure we need everything we are paying for. Sarah - is it worth putting an hour or so in the diary to go through?

Subject: P27 PCs Managed Service

Hi Jonathan

Our numbers for A Level Music Tech have been steadily increasing (brilliant!) but we've recruited 16 for Sept 23 - this is likely to be 17 now that an external student wants to switch from Music to Music Tech, with Music now not running in 23.

Great stuff for MT but our teaching space in P27/the studio only has 12 PCs in it - 11 student and 1 teacher. Although regular Music classroom P23 has 20 student PCs, timetabling always has MT on against GCSE or KS3 Music which means that P23 is just about always needed by other classes. The solution would be squeezing more PCs into P27 - we think 5 machines would cover us.

James came up to scope the space yesterday and we checked network ports and power points - both of which we seem to have plenty spare. James couldn't see a problem on those fronts. Space is the main issue so we are trailing some mini musical keyboards that are only as wide as a PC monitor screen (the existing keyboards are twice as wide and cause the space issue). Furnishing all PCs with these would allow us to squeeze in the 5 extra machines - we already have plenty of stools in there and luckily no legs on the desks to restrict seating.

James mentioned us possibly being able to get these extra PCs through the managed service, meaning no cost to the Music dept. We'd obviously cover the costs of music keyboards/audio interfaces/extra software licenses. The biggest need for this is the huge class of 17 we'll have in Y12 from September - we wouldn't be able to teach them in the existing space and don't have an alternative room - it'd be a mess for them. In a perfect world, we'd be able to have 2 groups of 8 but school can't afford that. Recruitment for MT does get stronger each year and the 2 GCSE groups of 2022-24 and secured 2 GCSE groups of 2023-25 will likely result in similar numbers for future MT cohorts. The extra PCs would not be left dormant after 2024. KS4 and 5 students often use P27 in study periods/P6 etc for coursework so the extra machines would help with that also.

Looking into future recruitment, we'll have to ensure a maximum number for the MT course as there is no more room for expansion - we'd have to cap it at 16 in future if we have these extra machines.

How does all of this sound?

Thanks
Ian

,T20230420.0047,Log In Help,"Good morning

I have 3 members of staff that are unable to get onto their computers and
emails.

Kerry Danby  tells me she doesn't have a log in for the computer. Also, her
emails have kicked her out and will no longer accept her password.

Sarah Weatherill also doesn't have a computer login.

Emma Smith is a cleaner so therefore has never needed a computer log in but
now due to the 2 factor authentication process needs a password to be able
to access her email.

Would it be possible to change these passwords so that I can try and get
these ladies logged on. Please let me know if you need any further
information.

Thank you

Rebecca

Dear Sir / Madam,

The Department for Education (DfE) is conducting an important study, called
the *Technology in Schools Survey* (TiSS). The research aims to understand
the state of technology within the school sector, including its quality and
availability and how it supports teaching and learning, school management
and administration.

This survey is also going out to leaders and teachers but the DfE is
particularly interested in gathering the views of IT leads like yourself.
The findings will help DfE to better support school staff in maximising the
benefits of using technology in educational settings. This could be through
reducing workload, improving access for pupils or something else.

https://www.iffresearch.com/TiSS

   - This is a short online survey that *takes 15-20 minutes to complete*
   - Any information provided will be kept confidential and anonymous
   - We would kindly ask you to *complete it as soon as possible*

*Additional information:*

   - If you have any queries about the survey, please contact the IFF team
   at edtech@iffresearch.com
   - *You may have responded to similar questions in 2020/2021, as part of
   the DfE EdTech survey. The TiSS will build upon the findings from this
   research*
   - Any personal data you provide will be held securely, used only for the
   purposes of the current research study, and will be deleted 6 months after
   the project ends
   - The research is being conducted on DfE’s behalf by IFF Research, an
   independent research organisation. Our work adheres to the Market
   Research Society’s code of conduct
   <https://www.mrs.org.uk/standards/code-of-conduct>
   - Your survey responses may be linked to information about your school
   which the DfE already holds, or which it is lawfully permitted access (for
   example data may be linked to the School Workforce Census). You can read
   the privacy notice for this study at: https://www.iffresearch.com/DfETiSS
   - If you would like to confirm the validity of the survey, please
   contact the DfE project manager Diana Bardsley at
   Edtech.RESEARCH@education.gov.uk


Many thanks in advance for your help with this important research.

Josh Burnell in 5/6 has requested that the random student picker add-on
that Matt Snowden had added be removed from Chrome - it pops up every time
they log in, they don't use it and staff find it very annoying! He said
that he couldn't remove it, as it said it was managed by the administrator.

Thanks

,T20230419.0235,Till System Vale of York Academy,"Good morning,
I hope this finds you well?
Can you please take a look and support the catering team with the following
issues relating to Parent Pay and the till system appearing not to be
syncing with each other at Vale.

Additions needed

   1. There are a number of teaching staff who are required to be added to
   the till and parent pay system(Jane Minderhall, Miss Rainbird, J Thacker,
   David Taylor, Giles Jenkins))
   2. There are a number of teachers who are on parent pay but not showing
   on the till system. (Mr Lyell, Samantha Mercer, James Gabatas,)
   3. New Students are not visible on the tills but have been set up on
   parent pay. (Seb Lewis, Ivan Osiemo, Ava Masterson, Rutandeo Madzud,
   Folabi, Meriseld Metlia, Nira Mete,)
   4. There are also a number of students who are not on parent pay or the
   till system (Summer Stubbs, Rachael Doller, Daniel Doller and
   another Doller )
   5. There are students who have recently become entitled to FSM who are
   not showing on the Till system (Lila- Rose Nelson, Marley Nelson)

Can you please instate a lend button on all tills. This will enable
students to go into debt to enable them to eat when they have funds on
their accounts

Some FSM students' parents add funds to their accounts. This is to enable
them to select extras above the FSM allocation.
The problem is we can not uncap this and so the students can not access the
extra funds. Kim has to write it down and then look back at their accounts
to see if there are extra funds. This has to be done after the break/lunch
service.

There is money on most of the students accounts but a proportion of it
appears not to be syncing from Parent pay to the Till System.
At the end of the day/week we run reports and these are showing a drop in
takings which indicates that the funds in Parent pay are not transferring
to the takings on the tills.

Finally could there be a breakdown in the end of day report to show morning
break and lunchtime takings?

Following our move over to Gmail, we would like to remove the Lamara Taylor

it is causing confusion.

I have tried to put mail forwarding on the Lamara Taylor account, but I
have done a test and I am not sure if it's working. Please can someone help
us to move all of the drive over for the HT? Would be great if someone
could pop and do this for us 😁

Hi Tim
Vital need Talkstraight to do something to sort the Error 317 issue with
our phones which we have had since Monday.  It started with one phone and
now half the school has issues.  Please could you chase Talkstraight to
sort the problem as this is becoming a safeguarding issue as we cannot
transfer calls to the Head or the DSL.

,T20230419.0074,P27 PCs Managed Service,"Hi Jonathan

Our numbers for A Level Music Tech have been steadily increasing (brilliant!) but we've recruited 16 for Sept 23 - this is likely to be 17 now that an external student wants to switch from Music to Music Tech, with Music now not running in 23.

Great stuff for MT but our teaching space in P27/the studio only has 12 PCs in it - 11 student and 1 teacher. Although regular Music classroom P23 has 20 student PCs, timetabling always has MT on against GCSE or KS3 Music which means that P23 is just about always needed by other classes. The solution would be squeezing more PCs into P27 - we think 5 machines would cover us.

James came up to scope the space yesterday and we checked network ports and power points - both of which we seem to have plenty spare. James couldn't see a problem on those fronts. Space is the main issue so we are trailing some mini musical keyboards that are only as wide as a PC monitor screen (the existing keyboards are twice as wide and cause the space issue). Furnishing all PCs with these would allow us to squeeze in the 5 extra machines - we already have plenty of stools in there and luckily no legs on the desks to restrict seating.

James mentioned us possibly being able to get these extra PCs through the managed service, meaning no cost to the Music dept. We'd obviously cover the costs of music keyboards/audio interfaces/extra software licenses. The biggest need for this is the huge class of 17 we'll have in Y12 from September - we wouldn't be able to teach them in the existing space and don't have an alternative room - it'd be a mess for them. In a perfect world, we'd be able to have 2 groups of 8 but school can't afford that. Recruitment for MT does get stronger each year and the 2 GCSE groups of 2022-24 and secured 2 GCSE groups of 2023-25 will likely result in similar numbers for future MT cohorts. The extra PCs would not be left dormant after 2024. KS4 and 5 students often use P27 in study periods/P6 etc for coursework so the extra machines would help with that also.

Looking into future recruitment, we'll have to ensure a maximum number for the MT course as there is no more room for expansion - we'd have to cap it at 16 in future if we have these extra machines.

How does all of this sound?

Thanks
Ian

,T20230419.0071,Laptop,"Hello there,

Chris looked at my laptop a few times last half term, but it is still not
connecting to SIMS and I cannot access the assessment logs / do data /
,marksheets.
It also keeps saying 'Disk full' which I have also had checked and there is
space.
It is also not fully printing out documents - I'm guessing because of the
space needed to print out.

Can I bring it down to get checked out / looked at - I really need to be
able to access Sims.

Thanks

,T20230419.0070,Photography exam - Next Wed and Thurs,"Hello there,

I hate to do this - but a couple of checks if that is ok:

The Photography exam is on next Wed and Thurs.
1.Would it be possible for someone to come down to G1 on Monday period 4 to
check that all students can log onto the computers and have access to the
printer in G1 as well as the colour one in reprographics - Most do, but it
has been a little temperamental.

2. Could it be checked that the printer in G1 has enough colour ink / has a
spare just in case it runs out in the exam - Students will be printing work
out for the exam,  Reprographics colour could also do with a check for this
too - Apologies if asking the wrong person - Please let me know if this is
the case.
3. Is it possible to disconnect the internet in G1 for those days -
Students can access their work in the exam, but are not allowed to go on
the internet.  There will not be many students doing this - But I wanted to
ask if this was possible or If I would have to sit with the key students to
make sure they did not access it.

Thats it - Apologies to ask!

,T20230419.0043,C15 computer,"Hi James
If the C15 computer isn't being used at some point can you have a look at it.
It wouldn't open a browser for over 5 mins, then opened loads of tabs but it wouldn't then let me click on any. Teams would only load to a blank screen.
In 25 mins all I could get was the desktop emails and one browser tab, but it took ages to move between the two, couldn't do any of my form time content.

Thanks

This is urgent as staff need access to this system to take registers access

I'm a teacher at Hempland Primary and have managed to lose all access to my school emails.

I recently got a new phone and was in the process of syncing my account so I can add the Microsoft authentication app to my phone.

I turned the sync on, removed myself as a user as instructed and then tried to login. When I was redirected to the Microsoft login, it continually asked for an authentication code but I can't put one in because the app isn't synced to my phone so won't give me a code.

I seem to be stuck in vicious circle!

Any help would be appreciated.

Kind regards

We have several Chromebooks at the moment that have various problems -
missing OS, keys that don't work, lost the ability to connect to the
internet. We also have a few with broken screens. Would it be possible for
someone to visit us and assess what is repairable etc...

A while ago we had a DfE delivery of laptops. These are currently not being
used as they haven't been set up yet. After we purchased them we were
advised that they weren't powerful enough to run the Ebor software. Could
we get some advice as to what we could do with them please?

Many thanks

,T20230418.0261,Reception class in St G's York - IT troubles,"Hello Vital,

Nicola Ellington in the Reception class has been having a number of
problems with the laptop in there, some of which may have been reported.

I investigated the problem with not being able to access Google Drive and
have resolved that (there were other profiles in Chrome, once I got rid of
the one it was trying to connect with and got Nicola signed into both
Chrome and Google with her account the GDrive stuff started working
properly) so if that is on someone's list you can tick that off!

She is also affected by the network time issue, and more often than not
can't get youtube videos to play.

She also can't print - sends a job to the secure print Q but it never
appears, and the printer is showing as 'paused' without any option to
unpause it. Not being able to print is getting to be a bit of a nightmare
for her!

Nicola works four days a week, so I'm not sure which day she isn't in, but
her email is nellington@stgy.smccat.org.uk if you need to contact her to
arrange a remote session,

Thanks
Kat.

Is there any way to modify the laptops to prevent this from happening again?

Are we also able to remove computer access for these students outside of ICT lessons for a period of time? I understand if that is too complex, but I'd like to be able to implement some additional punishment if possible.

Thanks in advance

We have Melanie Themel with us in MFL until the end of the school year. Please could she have a school e-mail address and computer log in? I'm not sure who authorises / organises this.

Thank you

Hope you're well! 

The chromebooks are all currently stuck on the internet selection start page where they flick between 'please wait' and 'select your network'. They indicate they are connected to BTPS wireless but then do not go to the login page where pupils can input their login details e.g. email address.

Please let us know if you can offer any help, it means we are currently unable to use the chromebooks.

from this morning email sent from Sarah Holmes - Carne re missing laptops
etc.

We have Dell / Chromebooks in a trolley in 306. There should be 17.
However, Lee Hill took 6 before Easter so I think he still has them in his
room.  I cannot physically lock the trolley as we share with reading groups
and one or two staff help themselves too making it difficult to keep track
where they have gone!

One of them is never used as wifi / internet doesn't work on it.

,T20230418.0119,Re: BBC Symphony Orchestra Discover is ready for download,"Hi James

2 things...

1 - I'm downloading a free plugin to use with Cubase but it has to be installed on each machine. I'm happy to chip away at this but I'd need an admin login to do it for all users. Is this possible? Need to at least test that it works on one machine before rolling it out.

2 - due to recruiting bigger Music Tech numbers next year, we're going to need more PCs in the studio P27. We have 12 currently including a teacher PC but have at least 16 students so we're looking for a further 5 PCS. We're buying smaller musical keyboard etc to help squeeze them in. Are we able to get 5 more machines that can be added in P27? Does it cost the music dept anything?

Thanks
Ian

HI Luke

We are facing an issue regarding our ongoing subscription to mathswatch.
Due to tighter limits on our level of protection we can't access the videos
in school.  Apparently it's to do with the system you use for showing
videos.

Is there a solution around this issue? We are keen to continue with our
subscription but our trust won't change the firewall settings.

I hope you are well and got some rest over the Easter hols. (probably not)

Wondering if you could sort this again for me. I have forwarded last years
emails because it should help get us back working again on this asap.

Jack's Casio Emulator code has stopped working - I think it is basically
expired. Please could you get us a new code (or whatever you did last time).

This is high priority as Jack has his GCSE examinations (plus uses this in
lesson all the time).

Thanks - let me know if you need more info from me

Subject: IT Recovery and User Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) Security
To:


Dear Colleagues,

The professional and resilient way in which staff and students right
across the trust have responded to the IT difficulties we are experiencing
has been inspiring and I thank you for your patience as we have negotiated
this difficult situation.

I would also like to recognise the team of staff and technicians at Vital
that have worked significantly longer hours to get us to this point.

As we start to reinstate and make available the Windows network there are
some required security improvements that have been implemented as part of
the rebuild.

One of the changes required will have an impact on staff logins and network
access, so in preparation for this rollout please read through the attached
two documents.  If you already have MFA set up then this shouldn't change
anything but please read the FAQ document anyway.

   - FAQ Document
   <https://drive.google.com/file/d/16wGyc9fXHOh9IjOebnIQXRLUGqXZ3Csn/view?usp=sharing>
gives
   answers to some of the expected questions in relation to MFA and
   implications from our security improvements.


   - Multi Factor Authentication
   <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1StgEkdSWvW2kb_aXuGFSPe393m0xpccQ/view?usp=sharing>
   (Staff MFA setup and Password reset) All staff will need to set up MFA
   using the following instructions when they are given their new windows
   password.


If the documents raise any further questions please send them directly to
myself in the first instance.

Kind Regards

Simon Bryan-Smith

When doing Google searches, my computer will switch to Bing. I googled how
I could stop this and this is what came up:

Google redirects to Bing happen because a browser hijacker has infected
your system. It is a type of malware that forcefully alters your browser
settings to promote suspicious websites. Luckily, you can easily get rid of
it to finally enjoy an uninterrupted browsing experience again.

I wonder whether someone needs to have a look at my computer, please.

Good Afternoon Toni,

I have tried to call you back regarding the voicemail you left us on Friday regarding the issues you are having with SchoolPod.

I have seen a previous case logged with us regarding SchoolPod outages and to answer your question, it looks like there is an issue with your firewall blocking access to SchoolPod as we have had no site outages. The attached document contains website URLs and IP Addresses that need to be whitelisted in order for SchoolPod to work without error.

Your IT Department will need to ensure that these have been whitelisted as we are unable to check this our end but should this still be an issue once completed, I will be happy to investigate further.

As for your contract, your schools contract automatically renews on an annual basis as stated in section 3.1 of the Terms and Conditions of your contract, the SchoolPod contract renews automatically for a 12 month period starting from the date of the original agreement, in your case, the next time the contract will renew is on the 22/03/2024 unless notice is given 90 days prior to this date.

If there are further concerns or improvements you would like to make to the system to help make things easier for you, i am happy to arrange a call with your customer success manager and myself who will be able to discuss any changes and try and resolve / implement these for you.

Kind Regards,
Jordan Corbett

,T20230417.0177,VYLHD - Staff Wifi issues,"Hi guys,

Here is one that I thought was getting sorted though the holidays?

The Staff Wifi here at Graham isn't working properly.

We have 3 wifi networks - the HSLT Radius (for computers)
The GRA Hotspot - not sure how this network works
And finally the GRAHS-PSK network.

The issue with the GRAHS-PSK is that staff can be added on to this network
but hardly anything works since it is locked down.

I believe that this issue was going to be resolved in the term holiday, but
it looks like it hasn't been looked into yet.

I think there is going to be a new wifi network for staff but not sure.

Please can you advise me?

Best regards,
Lee

We certainly can do this, it just might not be for a while as lot's of

Perhaps a summer holiday job.

We have kept the screens to replace older ones in the school, this was
always the plan for the compatible ones.

Hi Sam



The click and sign system Academia uses doesn’t like addresses that end in
.academy. Do you have an address that ends in .co.uk, .com or .org they
could use instead? It can be a personal email address if you are happy to
use that?

Hello,

Please could you contact Vital about the sound system in the hall? When Ann
and Laura  practised on Friday it was awful. Really crackly and was making
that weird humming noise. Even with this, Laura turned up to the max so we
couldn't hear it sing along.

We have the parents potentially in for the KS1 performance this Thursday
and Friday in the hall  too!

Hello. This is a student from staynor hall and I think that Miss / Mrs
Greenwood has been abusing her power as a ""Assistant Teacher"" by
1. Telling people off for e.g using a fidget on the table or in there hands
when they are not using it / people can not see it.
2. Raising her voice at students when they have done nothing wrong.
3. Not being far towards students with *disabilities.*

Thank you for reading this.

As requested before Easter, are we ok to borrow 10 chromebooks from 17th

If we can have them dropped off in the English office, that would be fab.

We seem to have a problem with one of the computer screens at the front of
the Pathfinder suite, it's the second screen which is used to project onto
the large screen at the front of the room.  The display is remaining black
when turned on but when you drag something onto it from the other screen it
still projects.

The room is not in use today so you can access the computer at any time,
however we have interviews and in-person training tomorrow so need to have
it working for these.

I've got it working without the display being detected - seems to be a
windows issue. The screen is duplicating because I've forced it to
duplicate even though windows itself can't see the monitor. But it means I
can't extend etc.

There seems to be an issue with the projector in L18 - it won't
project anything. It has a blank blue screen saying no RGB input. I have
tried switching from 'duplicate' screen to 'extend' screen. I have also
tried to make sure the cable is properly attached and it seems to be.

Hi Tamara,

Hope you’ve had a good Easter.

Please can you contact vital to reset my google password asap? Changed it

Thanks

We have a new staff member starting today - Lovette Turner - her details
are on Bromcom.

Please could you advise her school email address and password?

Also, she will need to be put on the school system and also Bromcom - she
should have admin rights on Bromcom as she will be working in the school
office alongside myself.

Any queries please let me know - my ICT technician Nick will be in school
today if he can help with anything.

Many thanks

,T20230417.0028,Computer in C12,"Hello,

The computer and projector in C12 are having some problems at the moment. The computer regularly shows an error message saying that the disk is full (especially when printing or creating new documents) and the projector has been struggling to turn on/ project an image when it is turned on (it will just show a blue screen and nothing else). This seems to be an intermittent problem, as other staff have reported it being fine, however I experienced both issues this morning during P1.

Many thanks and have a lovely Easter break,

Viv

Unfortunately I am still not with my KS3 classes this week as I am covering
KS4/5 for an absent colleague.

Some of my students appear to have forgotten their usernames/passwords
again from what I can see of the work not completed in the final week of
term.

Just a heads up, I have asked the cover teachers to email you on this email
should any students be unable to access with their Google account or
Windows account this week.

The lessons for when there will be cover (room 102) are:

Tuesday P1 and 3 (9,10 and 11.30)
Wednesday P1 and 2 (9.10 and 10.30)
Thursday P2 and 4 (10.30 and 13.00)

Morning,

Please could you give some advice as to why my personal device no longer
will remain connected to our wifi. Marcus previously  did ""something"" on my
phone but unfortunately it didn't work. I have safeguarding  updates come
through to my phone ,which need actioning, so whilst this is not working it
is proving somewhat problematic.

Thank you

To:

Hello deastwood ,

I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.
Currently I have gained full access to your account. In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months .

I know all your secrets, that is your business and life . It's not my problem , I just need quick money to solve a family problem .

I can see absolutely everything on your screen , I see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages . I am using harmful software that is driver-based, which refreshes its signatures on a 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect its presence .

NOTE : I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you ( happily masturbating ) , while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment .

I can also make public all your emails and chat history but it's not important to me. I just want money for the information I have and I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening .

You will transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of GBP 2000 to my Bitcoin account ( in case you don't know how to do that , it's a simple process which you can check out online ) .

This is my bitcoin account information ( Bitcoin wallet : bc1q3ttd6hae5hw364zzth8gtuc3flhf56qyk27dds ) Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I promise to delete all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all . My Father is in the hospital and I need this money . Please don't make me do this .

Ensure you complete the above mentioned transfer within 60 hours (2 days +). I will receive a notification right after you open this email , the countdown will start .

 If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public . Trust me , I am very careful , calculative and never make mistakes .

GOOD LUCK .

We have applied an update to Woodlesford’s Smoothwall appliance, however, we believe it has got stuck when trying to reboot as it is now showing as offline.



Please could someone onsite reboot the Smoothwall using the onscreen display on the physical Smoothwall box? We are unable to do this remotely with it showing offline.

Dear Customer,

We are writing to update you on some impending changes to how the SIMS
software you access is hosted. You currently access SIMS via our ‘Hosted
SIMS’ solution, and this is being retired and replaced by ‘SIMS Connected’. We
are making this change to provide you with a better and more consistent
solution.

As part of this process, the booking for your School The Compass Academy,
DfE number 8101103 is now confirmed for Monday, April 24, 2023, 11:00:00 AM
to change to SIMS Connected.

The change involves only a small downtime of approximately 15 minutes. We
provide a 30 minute time-slot for the process to take place.

If this date and/or time is unsuitable please email
SIMSConnected@parentpay.com, including your School’s name, DFE and any
additional contact/email address(es). Your rescheduled booking will need to
be within two weeks of the original booking.

No further action is required on your part but we do recommend that you
review the differences and training below.

The differences between Hosted SIMS and SIMS Connected are outlined HERE
<https://customer.support-ess.com/csm?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0052496>
.

Additional Online Training

We also offer additional online training and encourage you to register for
the  eLearning module for School Administrators, which  covers the items
below.

   - Launching SIMS and FMS Connected,
   - Accessing SIMS Connected drives and print,
   - Updating CTF and Exam Locations,
   - Getting help and viewing announcements.

To request the eLearning please email SIMSConnected@parentpay.com providing
your School’s name, DFE and email address(es) for those that require access.

Please be aware that if you are the main contractual contact for multiple
schools, you will receive a separate email for each school.



Best Regards

Hi Jo



I’ve just had a quick chat with our support team. Do you know if you have a
single Google Domain name for each school or across the Federation?



The Domain name is what comes after the ‘@’ in a Google email address. It’s
what a pupil would sign in with.



Using this, we could license everyone automatically.



If you’re not sure, do you have the email address of your IT guys so we
could have a quick chat with them?

Hi Jo



I’ve CC’d our support team into this email, so they can look into this and
help with activating the app yourself, rather than waiting for the North
Yorkshire council.



I know through the management page; you can centrally activate this and I
don’t think you have to wait for someone else to do this for you.



I’m sure they’ll be in touch within the next couple of days to help!



All the best

Andrew

settings are changing in the background predominantly on laptops. When
first logged on the proxy needs to be turned off but it regularly turns
back on throughout the day cutting off the connection.

This also seems to be happening on occasions where a staff member goes to a
different site from normal and logs onto a desktop. Could this secondary
issue be linked to the profile?

Hi there! I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack
your operating system. Currently I have gained full access to your account.
In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you
for several months. The thing is your computer was infected with harmful
spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content
previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮ Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan
viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device
that you own. It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen
and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without
your permission. In addition, I can also access and see your confidential
information as well as your emails and chat messages. You may be wondering
why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software. Let me break it
down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based, which
refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable
to detect it presence. I have made a video compilation, which shows on the
left side the scenes of you happily masturbating, while on the right side
it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ All I need
is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts
of people you are in communication with on your device or PC. Furthermore,
I can also make public all your emails and chat history. I believe you
would definitely want to avoid this from happening. Here is what you need
to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1250 USD to my Bitcoin account
(that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if
you don't know how to do that). Below is my bitcoin account information
(Bitcoin wallet): 1MSafx9aRzRybiqgGJnH1Ah4EJz5usuSxy Once the required
amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those
videos and disappear from your life once and for all. Kindly ensure you
complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +). I will
receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown
will start. Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make
mistakes. If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will
straight away proceed with making your private videos public. Good luck!

Before Easter I was trying to setup a piece of software called IMP Link
that allows data to be transferred from PS Financials to IMP our
forecasting software.  This has been setup on Pete Scotts system but we
don't have the password to access the PS Financials system.

I believe that the software is sitting on Pete's remote desktop.  Is there
anyway I can access this remote desktop to run the transfer?

If not the guys at IMP can reset the password by may need system
administrator access to do this.  What's the best way of doing this?

I'm back working in the office at Osbaldwick now all week.

,T20230406.0060,Certain websites/apps not working,"Hi there,

Quite a few of us recently are finding that youtube videos are no longer
working in school. This is causing quite a few problems in that videos
we've found for teaching purposes don't load. There's no 'blocked'
notification that comes up, the wheel just keeps spinning as if
continuously trying to load videos.

I have also found that I can't play a lot of songs from my Spotify account
that I used to be able to.

I'd appreciate it if this could be looked into.

Many thanks,
Hannah

I'm currently working on getting the welcome/sign in screen working at Manor. It is used in conjunction with the Visit-ed software which relies on an SQL database. This has since moved, it was previously located at 10.10.80.44 on manors network, it is no longer there and i have no idea where it has moved to. I need to know what address it is currently on as the find database feature isn't able to locate it on its own.

Dear Mrs Mullenger

Sorry to disturb you in the holidays.  My son (William Horner 7Bl) has
received several emails on WhatsApp claiming to be from ""your English
Teacher"" /  ""Mrs Mullenger"".

One saying that you are getting everybody's WhatsApp to enhance
teacher/student communication during the Easter Holidays, a second
saying that you have set a half term task and if he doesn't do it he
will receive a detention, a third and fourth following it up and a final
one saying that you are losing patience with him for not responding.

We have only just got him a new phone and downloaded WhatsApp as he said
that there is a group for his form and this is how they communicate out
of school. He hasn't actually joined the group or used it yet and there
are very few people who know his number.

Looking at the wording, we are pretty sure that these messages are not
from you but William has been worrying about it.  He has checked on
Google Classrooms and couldn't see any homework but he wanted me to
email you and double check as he doesn't want to get into trouble.

Thank you

Best wishes

Susan Horner (William's mum)

Dear Mrs Mullenger

Sorry to disturb you in the holidays.  My son (William Horner 7Bl) has
received several emails on WhatsApp claiming to be from ""your English
Teacher"" /  ""Mrs Mullenger"".

One saying that you are getting everybody's WhatsApp to enhance
teacher/student communication during the Easter Holidays, a second
saying that you have set a half term task and if he doesn't do it he
will receive a detention, a third and fourth following it up and a final
one saying that you are losing patience with him for not responding.

We have only just got him a new phone and downloaded WhatsApp as he said
that there is a group for his form and this is how they communicate out
of school. He hasn't actually joined the group or used it yet and there
are very few people who know his number.

Looking at the wording, we are pretty sure that these messages are not
from you but William has been worrying about it.  He has checked on
Google Classrooms and couldn't see any homework but he wanted me to
email you and double check as he doesn't want to get into trouble.

Thank you

Best wishes

Susan Horner (William's mum)

I have a faulty Chromebook where the charging pin has snapped. Please can you collect this and replace it in the first week back (Monday 17th April). I don't think you will be able to fix it so it probably will need a straight swap. Also do you still have some Chromebooks which haven't been returned/awaiting parts?

Zoe has had to wait far too long now for this issue to be resolved. I was
expecting a solution to have been found but that appears not to be the
case.

Surely the simplest thing to do would be to create an entirely new account,

would that not work?

,T20230331.0189,Police Cyber Alarm set up - email 1,"Hi,

As discussed today, I need to set up Police Cyber Alarm for our 3 schools,
and having spoken to someone in the NYCC IT team today, they advised
speaking to you as it's tied in with server support.

I've been sent an access code for each of the 3 schools (see email below
for one of these) and now need to do the next stage of the installation.
The email below and attached doc directs me to the members area of the
Cyber Alarm site, and there's then a form to fill in.  One of the
questions on the form is about where our Cyber Alarm data collector will be
installed, so I need to ask your advice about that - NYCC said it's often
done by having a virtual server on the school server.  There's also
guidance on the attached about the spec needed for the virtual collector.

I've got the external facing IP addresses that are asked for on the form
from NYCC.

I know a lot of you are away at the moment but I'd appreciate speaking to
someone next week to try to get this sorted - I will be on email next week
or you can call me on 07922 039150 - please leave a message if I'm not
around and I'll ring you back.

I'll forward the emails for the other two schools shortly.

Hi Chris - thanks for changing Lizzy's e-mail etc, unfortunately she is
still unable to log into Edulink One which is a problem as she is unable to
do registers, view data or book resources and these are important aspects
of the role she is training in. Do you think this might be resolved for the
start of the summer term?
Cheers,
Jane

I have deleted a lot of documents in the past two weeks on my chromebook.
Unfortunately the bin is completely empty.


The lady I spoke to on the phone said she may be able to restore from the
vault.


If you are able to restore all the past deleted documents that would be
great. I'd have deleted them all on an evening.


One of the documents I needed today is the link below. It's quite an
important document therefore if you are able to find this it would be much
appreciated!

,T20230331.0147,Y5/6 iwb in fishergate - Josh Burnell's laptop,"Hi Vital

The promethean screen isn't connecting for sound for Josh from laptop with
the System Name BCS07S3

If the HDMI is connnected directly, the image connects very intermittently
sdo someone from vital has connected it via s dell dock as, presumably, a
power booster but the audio isn't connecting at all.

When we swapped to direct hdmi, sound and vision briefly connected  then it
went to no signal.

I tested the audi from the built-in device and that works, so screen to
sound bar is connected and all working. There isn't a 3.5mm input on the
faceplate so couldn't test that. Only sound device available when connected
via dell dock is laptop realtek speakers.

Can someone take a look please? He's currently working all week apart from
Monda afternoons, until SATs week, so most days OK!

I know it's a bit last minute before the holidays but ideally it'd be good

There is no rush for these so please leave until Kevin is back.  He just
needs to allocate exam accounts and issue passwords back to me.  Both of
these are Applied Law so the accounts will have no internet, but they will
have spell check enabled.

The dates are 3rd May and 10th May

,T20230329.0203,Library Account for Knavesmire,"Hi Guys!

As per my conversation with Joe a little bit earlier, I would like to
request a generic windows account be set up for our school library. At the
moment individual members of staff are logging into the library PC with
their own accounts to allow access to Reading Cloud. This leaves those
staff members' accounts vulnerable if children are performing library duty
using those accounts. I am an office member and I would be concerned at the
content which could be reached, from a DPA perspective, by accessing the
Drives and systems I use in my day-to-day roll.

The generic account would be used for that PC and to allow library duties
to be performed in isolation - this is only access to the internet to
access Reading Cloud. It would require NO mapping to Network Drives and
should not have an email account which can be accessed. Please let me know
if you need any further information or need to run through any other points
of access which I might not have though.

Kind regards,

Rachel

I’ve been in touch re Kaylum Preston’s laptop before. They are trying to
facilitate online tutoring via zoom or teams and neither is working. I’ve
tried setting up a zoom meeting via my email and it’s blocked. Can you
advise whether this can be unblocked (or teams). They have been trying to
sort this for 2 weeks now and are getting quite frustrated!

I get there would be blocks on things but if we were facilitating remote
learning as we had to post covid, there would need to be some method of
doing this.

bays in the PC's are not an electrical safety issue, therefore if a student
placed their hand in or anything metallic they will be ok- please confirm
that for H&S records.

Can you also please confirm if placing anything at all inside could cause a
problem, such as overheating and a fire. I pointed this out at the time.
A student found some fabric inside one this morning, luckily it had not
been switched on at the time. I am investigating how that happened.

Thanks

,T20230328.0135,Transition to new headteacher,"Hi

I am retiring from my post as headteacher at St Aelred's at Easter and a
new headteacher (Claire Hughes)  starts on 17 April 2023.

I am headteacher over the Easter holiday and will need to access the
laptop for some of this time to complete some outstanding tasks and
prepare a transition folder or documents for the new headteacher.

The new headteacher will have an NPCAT email address but the
headteacher@stael.smccat.org.uk  and  the head.staelredsprimary@york.gov.uk
emails will need to be linked to her email address.

I assume a message is set up on my sulyett@stael.smccat.org address to
direct people emailing me to the main office email address?

I also have a school iPad that needs to be set up for the new headteacher.

NPCAT will give the new head access to some shared drives where key
documents are stored such as School Development Plan.



Please could you advise what is best practice in terms of process and what
you need me to do.  Please could you also advise whether any of this should
be dealt with by NPCAT rather than yourselves?

Kind regards
Suzanne

As discussed please can you look at moving my home folder to the cloud so I can trial it and start making the resources ready for the move after half term.

Also can you pull together the list of the people with the biggest home folders so we can start to think about how we tackle those?

Good morning Marcus

I have just received the schedule for the installation of our new photocopiers which will be installed next Thursday.

Jackson at Riso has advised that IT to link up the machines will be needed from 10.00am

Please could you have a look to see if this will fit in with your current schedule.

I look forward to hearing from you.

We are having a copier coming in on trial on Thursday 3rd November, it will need linking to the system so we can trial it properly, it this something you can do for us. The copier company (Sharp) will have the drivers to load on the server with them or know where to access from the net.

I have returned to work after a day off and the speakers in my classroom
(S1) are no longer working properly. The problem seems to be where the wire
connects to the box in the wall - I'm not sure if the wire or the connector
has been damaged. The sound works if I hold the wires in place in the
connector and lift them up slightly, otherwise no sound can be heard.
Please could this be fixed?

Thanks,
Fay

Over the past few weeks my laptop has been getting slower and slower. It
has finally stopped working all together and wont even turn on. It has got
to the point now that I need a new work laptop. I have a chromebook to use,
however much of the work I need and software is only available on a laptop.
I hope this can be resolved sooner rather than later.

,T20230322.0209,Moving Equipment,"Hi,

I plan on moving from my room into the Pupil Support room (the EYFS office
next door to Nidd/Swale).  Andy Willson is also planning on moving in there
but I note the ports are just on one wall.
I will take my phone with me and swap it with the phone that's in there,
however, the numbers will need to be swapped over (Small Office ext3015/Me
3003).  It would also be helpful if Andy could take his phone (Ext. 3006)
although not a necessity if this is not possible.

I think I would be able to move my equipment ok but the problem we will
have is connecting Andy as where we would like to place his desk there
isn't a port (they are on the wall near the main desk).

Please could you let me know when Mateusz would be available to assist with
the move?

Many thanks
Clare

Hi Toni



I understand Ben has rebooted all of the equipment and has carried out testing too.  It appears the issue may be related to your wifi solution.



As you can see below, the images show the office pc connected via the LAN and then via Wi-Fi and you can see the difference in speed.



[cid:image010.jpg@01D95CC7.8CE70D20]





[cid:image011.jpg@01D95CC7.8CE70D20]



We have also checked with KCOM direct to see if there is any problems with the circuit from their end and they confirm it is working as expected.



You  may need to ask your ICT support provider to check your internal network and wifi solution.



I hope this helps.



Kindest regards



Sue

,T20230321.0129,Costing Additional Music Machines/Laptops,"Hi James

You might have already had these conversations but I'm aware Katie H is investigating the cost of extra laptops/PCs for over subscribed GCSE and A Level Music classes. Can you factor in the system requirements for our software - Cubase 11 Pro can't run on the bog standard laptops/machines. You'll know more than me the spec of our current PCs up here. But please factor that in to give an accurate picture of the costs, if possible.

The software and hardware adds much more onto the cost, but I can pass those details onto Katie if needed.

Thanks

We seem to be sporadically getting something that causes one of our servers
to trip.  This morning this happened at 7.30am.  After about 20 mins it let
me reset (up until then the trip switch just tripped back each time).  The
PC's mostly came back on but we have still experienced difficulties all
day.  Email is fine but access to drives has been an issue for many staff
(they have red crosses against these).  The electric main gates have not
worked since and we have been unable to reset them.

Access to web based systems is hit and miss and often crash once in.

The Internet in general is very slow again which is a repeat of the issues
we were having last week.

Please can this be looked into as a matter of urgency.  I have logged with
Talk Straight also.

,T20230317.0161,Printing,"Good afternoon,

Sorry for the rant, but I’ve just spent the last hour printing all my
coursework from Google classroom opening and selecting the work, printing a
page at a time. I have printed off about 60 pieces of work and for some
reason none of it has gone to the printer even when it was asking me to
click on the account each time. I don’t know what’s happened but I’m really
fed up as this is now the third hour this week I’ve done this for it not to
work. I just don’t have time to keep trying it. What can I do to get this
sorted please? I stayed till 4:30 tonight to make sure it’s all printed so
I could go home at the weekend and mark it and now I can’t do that because
I have to leave and get my children and none of it has come through to the
printer. I don’t understand why. PLEASE can somebody help me.

used it through Google Classroom but had to download it first (there is a

,T20230317.0031,English ITT student - school pass and email.,"Dear Chris

I hope this email finds you well. I was hoping that you could answer a few
questions that have cropped up while I have been on my placement at Vale of
York.

I have been signing in as a visitor each day as I do not have a pass to get
into the school. I have been advised to contact you to see whether it is
possible for a pass to be created for me? I have also noticed that I cannot
now print from a chromebook without one, which may cause difficulties for
my teaching.

My mentor has also asked whether I can be added to edulink and class charts
for the purpose of accessing student data and completing registers in my
lessons. Jane has been informed that the reason I cannot access edulink or
class charts is because of the voy itt1 email that has been created for me.
I was therefore wondering whether it would be possible to change my email
to one which allows me to access these resources?

I understand that the situation is difficult given that I am only here
until the end of May, however I would be very appreciative of any help that
can be provided.

Kind regards,
Elizabeth Manger (English ITT student)

Parent/Carer

I would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to our new parental
information and communication system EduLink One. We will be using this
system to provide you with essential information about your child/ren and
their lives at Vale of York Academy.

Edulink One is a purpose built parental communication tool in the form of
an iOS and Android App – with support from a website for those unable to
access the apps.

For security, this new system requires an individual parent login username
and password. If you have more than one child at the school, you will only
require one account and all children will be visible through this.

To access this new tool you will need to either:

Search for EdulinkOne (Overnetdata) from the Apple App Store or Google Play
Store and install the App to a mobile device – you can have it on multiple
devices if you wish.
If you do not have a device suitable for the app, you can access the same
great features through the website at
https://www.edulinkone.com/#!/login?code=voya
We will let you know of new features by email.

Your username to access EduLink One is: p_kmcseve2

Please follow this link to set your password:

https://www9.edulinkone.com/#!/login?reset=0fwx9PAbzkOIfvZ_1Nk1OMbRaN8oCj0AsRE-5vqxwPiD9-5Fmglxmt1DwZnqE4LzU2AoFEFglxPhg2UR

NOTE: This link can only be used once and it is only valid until 13th March
2023 (11:22 AM)

You will then be able to access EduLink One on the web at
https://www.edulinkone.com/#!/login?code=voya

You can download the App for your device

The phones in our offices are not working properly again.  It is doing the
thing where it starts to beep and cuts off so the person on the other end
of line cannot hear us and we cannot hear them.

This is really difficult when we are trying to contact parents.

Thanks

,T20230224.0039,No internet connection in Library - Aspire Academy,"Good Morning,

We had previously raised a ticket back in September due to poor internet
connection in the Library at Aspire Academy. I'm not sure if anyone looked
into this but the internet has been working since.

A member of staff from Vital came into the Academy early this week and
alerted us that the internet issue has been fixed from the September
ticket. However, for the last two days, the internet has not been working
in the Library and we are not sure why.

Please can this be looked into.

Kind Regards,

Ellie Richardson

As part of the recruitment process we now have to do an online check as
part of KCSIE.  I've attached the guidance I need to follow but basically I
need to check Instagram, Twitter and Google the candidates name.  I've just
typed in a candidate's name that I need to check and it shows she's on
Instagram but it comes up with this message, any suggestions?

Thanks

,T20230220.0205,Mac Mini problem,"Hi

Mac Mini (number 1) seems to have a fatal error. It will only open in
recovery mode and is requesting an OS reinstall. I have looked and the hard
drive appears to be totally full which shouldn't be the case.

It looks like it might need completely setting up from scratch again. I
could erase the hard drive and re-install the OS myself but obviously
requires a specific setup from Vital.

I can bring it to you if you like?

I was in VOYA today and they are missing lots of files that are probably
saved on my personal drive.

I'd like to be able to log on and then ask VITAL to transfer a load of
files over to the shared drive at Vale please?

These are important SEND documents that the school need.  I have also had a
continual string of requests to share access too.  Is it possible for you
to transfer the ownership over to Vale staff so that this stops happening
