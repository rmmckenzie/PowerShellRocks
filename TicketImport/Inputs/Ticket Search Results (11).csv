I called earlier this week to inform you that we had purchased licences for
our new Chromebooks that we didn't need. We bought 33 new Chromebooks and
were told we needed licences which we purchased. What we didn't realise is
that we already had approx. 25 licences unused. Therefore, we only needed a
few licences.

We were not made aware of the licences we already had. I just happened to
stumble upon it and called up to query. I asked for these to be refunded as
we don't need them and won't be purchasing many more in the next year or
so. I was told someone would call me back, but I haven't heard anything.

Please can you advise.

I am a current trainee at BGP but am moving to Poppleton for 8 weeks, and
then moving back to BGP for the rest of year. Is there a way that my

easier to just keep this account?

https://www.timetabler.com/PDFs/OPT-2024-Appendix.pdf

*To download the latest version of **Options* *please follow stages A, B,
C :*

*A.*
For safety's sake (it's best to be paranoid!), take [or make sure that you
have] a *Backup* of your existing data, as described on page ix in the
Manual (and HelpMovie 9), and keep this Backup safe. You can check that
this Backup is good by using FileMenu->Verify.
To be doubly safe, make a second Backup, on a USB memorystick, and Verify
it.

*B.*
The 4 steps to download & install the Upgrade are shown at :
http://www.timetabler.com/Download-Instructions-OPT.html

Click with your mouse on the link *below* to start the download, and follow
the 4 steps.
On a broadband connection the download will take less than a minute.


https://www.timetabler.com/upgrades/OP6d--2024/Setup.EXE



Please note that you should install the new version to the same directory
as the previous version of *Options*.  By default this is at C:\OPTwin
If you install to a different directory, then use FileMenu -> OPT-Restore to
load in the data that you saved in part A.



*C**.*
When you start *Options*,
i) go to HelpMenu->About Options and check that it now shows *Options
2024*  and
also
ii) check that it shows your School Name correctly at the top of the screen.


------------------------------

D.



If you want to install on a *different* machine from the download machine,
then :



--at Step 1 of the 4 steps above, choose ‘Save’ instead of ‘Run’, and
select a folder to Save the download in,



--Click on the ’Open folder’ button or visit the location you saved the
download in,



--The downloaded file is called Setup.EXE …copy it to a transferable memory
device (eg. to a USB FlashDrive 'memorystick').

--Then take that device to the second machine, find the file named
Setup.EXE and just double-click on it to install the new version.
Please note that you should install the new version to the same directory
as the previous version of *Options*.  By default this is at C:\OPTwin
If you install to a different directory, then use FileMenu -> OPT-Restore to
load in the data that you saved in part A.

Sorry for blanket email, but I didn't know who was best to contact.

Emma Oxley (new RS teacher) is beginning at Manor w/b 8th January. She is
keen to get her login details, so that she can start looking at resources
at home before she begins teaching that first week back.

Is it possible for her to get these and get logged in from home?

Thanks in advance,

Ellis.

,T20231221.0127,AHS phone extension connected to TSH number,"Hello

This may have been raised before but is an ongoing issue.  We regularly get
phone calls from parents saying that they are returning our call (01904
806900) but nobody from the Teaching School Hub has called them and they
don't know who called them either.

All we can think of is this stems from when Alexis Green-Harding worked
with the TSH and had ext 6903 in his office which is now Penny McDermott's
office and now extension 5360.  Someone told us a while ago that Alexis'
number was now attached to AHS but could the actual telephone still be
linked to our incoming phone line?

Hoping you can help detach whichever phone is causing this issue, thanks.

,T20231221.0091,Manor CE Academy UK ePlatform access issues,"From <meganm@eplatform.co>: Hi there, 

 

My name is Megan and I am the customer success manager here at ePlatform. 

 

I ran a training session with Monica O'Neill from Manor CE Academy UK this
morning and she'd mentioned that some students were having access issues
with some of the eBook titles. She'd also mentioned that you suspected it
was to do with your firewall/security setting so thought it would be helpful
to send you over a list of domains to whitelist if you don't already have
them. Please see more information below: 

 

Content Filters.
Some customers may have restrictions on their network to prevent access to
certain websites. In order to ensure that users on your network can access
ePlatform either through a browser or using the mobile app, you will need to
white-list the following domains and the IP address 52.237.241.216 

www.wheelers.co.nz <http://www.wheelers.co.nz> 
*.wheelersbooks.com.au <http://wheelersbooks.com.au> 
*.eplatform.co <http://eplatform.co>

*.wheelers.co <http://wheelers.co> 
*.wheelers.co.nz <http://wheelers.co.nz/> 
*.findawayworld.com <http://findawayworld.com/> 

 

I'm confident this- along with the other steps you've already taken from
your end- will resolve the issue for you but if it persists, please don't
hesitate to get back in touch. 

 

With kind regards, 

 

Megan

I've been trying to print on the Follow Me printer apps while the
Technology printer isn't working and it seems to be defaulting to printing
double sided which I understand is useful for most purposes but for art we
need to display the images we print, so we can't have them double-sided.
I've tried changing the double-sided option but there doesn't even seem to
be an option that exists to change this on a one-time basis. Am I missing
something? Is there any way we can change it so that each user can set
their own default for that option?
Many thanks for your help!
Keira.

We can't print anything in the DT department at the moment. I've had a look
at the print queue and there seems to be an error on a couple of prints
that s.bartesch tried to print yesterday at around 1.15pm which appear to
be holding up the queue. I can't cancel them as I don't have access to her
account & she's not in. Please can you help? We use the printer a lot on
Thursdays for the art department...
Many thanks!
Keira.

,T20231220.0123,Home use of Laptop,"Good Afternoon,

We have a staff laptop that a member of staff would like to take home. It
is previously Laura Rushmer’s laptop (Class 1 teacher) but is being used
being a cover teacher on our school supply login. When the laptop is home,
it says unable to connect to proxy server. It also has no icon on the Home
Screen to switch to home internet- unsure what this is called.

I was wondering as it’s so close to Christmas if this could be done
electronically rather than physically needing the laptop.

Look forward to hearing from you.

,T20231220.0105,G drive and sharing folders,"Hi,

Please may you help....

I am setting up folders on our shared Google drive to store procurement
information. I have attempted to share these with a few people. Some can
see and others can't - David Wheeler has said he can't see the folder.
Please could you investigate?

Also, I've had this happen twice now - at the end of the day, 4.30pm when
I've gone to shut down my laptop, I've got warnings to save open documents
(word and excel usually). I've gone back to save and the first time the G
drive had vanished completely and the second time it appeared but with an
error message and wouldn't allow me to save. I've had to save work to the
desktop instead. It all feels very unsatisfactory, especially when I'm
trying to finish for the day.

Also I've noticed that my bookmark folders have changed from yellow to
white - something just doesn't feel right (screen shot below). I've been
shutting down/restarting regularly.

Many thanks

Helen

Hi Mike



When we last spoke, I found your database was in Full recovery mode, which
can cause the log file in the database to grow large quite quickly. I
changed the setting the shrunk the file, and that’s when we agreed that it
had probably improved.



However, I’ve just started checking some other things that we normally
check, and I’ve noticed that your server only has 6.9GB or memory, and
currently 5.6GB is in use.  I would normally check that sort of thing, but
I can’t see any notes previously about this.  This may be the cause of your
issue. We are generally recommending 16GB of memory on Infinity servers,
and our absolute minimum in the past has been 8GB, so I would recommend
that you add memory into that server as soon as you can, and then we review
again.



I think that would probably solve any issues you are having, as I can’t
currently see anything else that would cause this type of issue in your
Infinity system.



Kind regards



Diane

under the netflix educational license so I was wondering if I was allowed
to show it? It is rated 13+
Kindest regards,
Tim.

,T20231220.0018,Session today,"Hi all,

Quick plan of action for this afternoon's session:

Guy, are you OK to be with us for about 1.05pm? Please go to main reception.

Kelly, can you meet Guy at reception and bring him over to W13.

James, please can you meet us in W13 at the start of P4 for ICT issues.

I'll register my sixth form class and send them to the panto, then come and meet you both in W13.

Kelly once I have arrived, you can then chase any who have not turned up, then come back to relieve me so I can go back to my sixth form group.

Any behaviour issues, message me and I'll come and sort it; sure they'll be fine though.

Thanks

Someone was in my room (En8) yesterday before AM reg to try to help another
staff member fix their computer. When I arrived, my little heater was on
but one of the plugs for the fairy lights was missing. The lights belong to
a member of my form and they are quite distressed about the plug going
missing -- if whoever was in my room happened to mistakenly take it, please
could this be returned urgently so the student can take it home over the
holiday?

Unfortunately, I am still getting the message that either my email account

Could you please confirm that my email is:

Hope it isn't something too difficult to resolve.  Here is a copy of the

Perhaps you could have a go at signing me in and changing the password?

Good evening all,

Since using chrome books during PPA time in school, I have not been able to
access my CwR Gmail from home unfortunately.

Please could my Gmail account password be reset - I have tried to reset,
but it has repeatedly asked for a request from the administrator.

I do apologise for any inconveniences,

Kind regards,

,T20231219.0177,iPad apps,"Hi there,

We have a set of iPads that are managed by you. For our inset day on 8th
jan we need to have the YouTube app downloaded on some of them so that we
can use some virtual reality headsets. Would you be able to do this for us?
We would then need them deleting after the session as we wouldn’t want the
children to access the app.

Thanks,

Kirsty

I seem to be having problems with Adobe today, it is taking a really long
time to load up any pdf's or crashing. I've also been unable to send PDF's
for signature on adobe for months because everytime I do it just seems to
load forever and never send.

The internet speed in the Hope office seems to have taken a real nosedive
in the last couple of months to the extent that I am having to
mobile hotspot my phone's internet to get through a google meet which I
believe other members of staff have also had to do.

Is there anything that can be done to improve this?

The following websites are blocked for pupils in St George's (York) and
they are coding activities that we use in lessons - please can they be
whitelisted? Yes, they are 'games' of a sort but it is gamified learning,
not just game-playing!

Both work for staff, but not for the kids on the Chromebooks at present.

,T20231219.0050,Skedda Reminder: Add Payment Method Before 1/1/2024 To Continue Using It,"From Mark Gentry <info@team.skedda.com>: Continue using Flex for a discounted price when you transition over

Hi IT,

Thank you for being a valued Skedda customer!

As a reminder, the last day the free Flex plan will be available is December 31st, 2023. To continue using your Skedda account and enjoying all its functionality, please add a payment method before January 1st, 2024.

Here’s what you can do to prepare for the changes:

🥇 Why are these changes occurring?

During our 10-year history, we haven’t raised prices for our customers. During this time, we released dozens of major product improvements, offered innovative features, five-star security and an all-star support team—at no cost!

While we previously offered a free plan, we are unfortunately no longer able to support the costs associated with it, and will be sunsetting it.

To learn more about the changes, visit https://d2BF2q04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/L0+113/d2BF2q04/VVqBzW1pZ6M6W6vh6SX4f52PbW1CR28957djThN5n2LRv3pyd0W8wLKSR6lZ3pbW8BG9k17mtDG5W7Q5j-59lCbsHW81QjD28VNGkhW6L1v7c7-HrjJW6C5bVx6XrPgsN4Tq6ttsZM0nW2_H29f7TH8FTV2RWV25ZQggWMLt2CCvlZ4QVD61rw90lrBCVFd58x2sC-PBW4fRhlj6bYKF8VCv3yz5_8yrrW3ZSTDk75DQ45V74XPR5_r8BpW10c9pT23yv1pW4X2tth7YtmwyW7TXzy27qd7dbW7nWLwH1MQlFFN1vq6rzVRp05W2V8mjF3Q9HCkW3VPmFj7qXW74W2P-sL97hc-q3W6ZFbzJ5fGB5NN2GpSW7GW2zbW7Q_Rmt3NXBYcW4NQ7V06h9k5HW8-dgg26RH4q4f49FVzj04 (https://d2BF2q04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/L0+113/d2BF2q04/VVqBzW1pZ6M6W6vh6SX4f52PbW1CR28957djThN5n2LRv3pyd0W8wLKSR6lZ3pbW8BG9k17mtDG5W7Q5j-59lCbsHW81QjD28VNGkhW6L1v7c7-HrjJW6C5bVx6XrPgsN4Tq6ttsZM0nW2_H29f7TH8FTV2RWV25ZQggWMLt2CCvlZ4QVD61rw90lrBCVFd58x2sC-PBW4fRhlj6bYKF8VCv3yz5_8yrrW3ZSTDk75DQ45V74XPR5_r8BpW10c9pT23yv1pW4X2tth7YtmwyW7TXzy27qd7dbW7nWLwH1MQlFFN1vq6rzVRp05W2V8mjF3Q9HCkW3VPmFj7qXW74W2P-sL97hc-q3W6ZFbzJ5fGB5NN2GpSW7GW2zbW7Q_Rmt3NXBYcW4NQ7V06h9k5HW8-dgg26RH4q4f49FVzj04 ) .

✅ What do I need to do to continue using Skedda?

Please add a payment method in your Skedda account before January 1st, 2024. If you do not add a payment method by then, your account will revert to read-only status and you will no longer be able to make any bookings.

💳 How do I add a payment method inside my account?

Adding a payment method to your account is simple:

- Log in to your Skedda account (https://d2BF2q04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/L0+113/d2BF2q04/VVqBzW1pZ6M6W6vh6SX4f52PbW1CR28957djThN5n2LQW3gVDYW7lCdLW6lZ3n8W7mWksg2hFv46W69yn0n8HtHdPW6mqWyK8MVTLDW2JkyhL2BYPFbW4lZTq85g23PxN57bK0x1kKDZW1bXQRV6GBhdlW29FYrh1HHQcbW4N2q9Y4k5XmwW3LPysl405QfCW5ZgBj160YCs1W6w5cw7662kHfW6QjVgW5wWKSpW4J3hBr89GKVXN8bf0QF9s0J_W5-Sqvg5kRZ9nW8M8v8N3lVrFyW20HX0h23rYy_W4V460g49_vyhW2DNs7q9kqqdzW4t0kvx8Cf2XJW2wNbY32lW-pWW2nZftH4CHzQcW42kB1c1WjqZlf4yVv-M04 ) .

Subject: RE: Criminology accounts

Hi James

We have Criminology exams again 18 & 19th January, we are using computer rooms so no laptops needed but we will need 58 logins set up the same as before (no internet, word doc on Exam write).

They will need to be disabled after the exam on the 18th January, 9am start. (3hrs + 45 mins for extra timers)
Enabled for 19th January, 9am start and disabled after the exam (2 hrs + 30 mins for extra timers)

They will need to be enabled again for each class to work on in lessons on 22nd, 23rd, 24th & 25th January. They will be allowed Internet access for this part for the assessment. I will be able to tell you which logins will be needed on each date and the time they are required.

Are you able to do them before we finish for Christmas as I will need to assign to students and print out desk cards etc.

Thanks
Jo

We've got some speakers in the hall that Elementary provided.  There's a wire that goes into a box linked to the speakers, and the end of the wire has snapped off and is stuck inside the connector on the box - see photos attached.  Is this something you might be able to help with, or would it be Elementary?

,T20231218.0233,Excel,"Last week I mentioned to Ben that I have an issue with Excel.  It won't
allow me to use formula and opens 2 excel files every time I send a report
from SIMs.  Ben asked me to log in on a different PC to see if it was just
on mine.  I tried it today and it appears to be fine on the other PCs.

I'm not sure how Excel is set up in my office as I have to run an addon for
SISRA,

,T20231218.0209,Old emails,"Hi

Is it possible for you to gain access to old staff emails?

We have a member of staff who did extra hours in March/April time.  She
gave the previous School Business Partners (Hayley and Carrie) the
information I suspect this was provided to Sam Tonks in HR.

Hayley, Carrie and Sam have all left.  We have no record of the dates of
these extra hours and the staff member can't now remember the exact dates
etc.  We have owed this lady the money for a long time but cannot find the
info on the dates.  Our electronic sign in system doesn't go back this far.

Is there a way for you to check the emails from Sam Tonks's account and
find any from Hayley or Carrie which contain this information?

,T20231218.0180,Reports on SIMS,"Hi,

I'm not able to open any previous reports on SIMS today as I usually would
- I often look at the most recent reports students had to tie into round
robins/ahead of parents meetings etc. I do this by SIMS > student > linked
documents > Open > View. It is bringing up an 'error' window.

I don't suppose there are any ideas why it wouldn't be working for me?

Thanks,

Hope you had a lovely weekend?

Please could someone advise me with the issue I am having with my laptop
connecting to the WIFI at the school sites? When I was at Forest of Galtres
my laptop wouldn't connect to the WIFI but could find the network. I was at
Burton Green today and It didn't have the option to connect to their WIFI
either as it couldn't find any networks to connect to. Not sure if my
laptop needs some sort of update as I only got it at the start of last
month?

Many thanks,
Megan

Hi Stuart and Simon

The school laptop you handed over, Stuart, will not connect to Outlook or Teams. I did sign in at school on Thu and it worked then.
I'm ill with tonsillitis so will not be going into work so obviously it's still a very unsatisfactory situation as I can't access any school documents.

Thanks

Kristina is moving to be a full time staff member at Brotherton in the new
year but her email address was originally set up with the wrong spelling of
her surname so it was set up as c.thompson1@ebor.academy. I was wondering
if a new email address has been set up for Kristina yet and if so what is
it? I asked the school to request this last week.

We are having problems with a couple of the desk top computers in the main HUB area

PC22181 - also showing low disc space and 'behaving' erratically

Both these machines sit next to the communal photocopier on the ground floor of the HUB.

We would be really grateful if someone could look at this asap as students do use the machines often to do homework at lunch and break times.

Thanks so much for your help with this.

Thank you for letting me know - I am a little concerned this hasn't been
flagged before now really as there are a lot of emails I've referenced in
briefing that you must not have been receiving! However, I'm glad we've
worked it out now so it can be resolved.

If you need any support this week to get the reports underway please do let
me know and I can help - did you find the student questionnaires in your
pigeon hole okay?

IT - please could you ensure Charlotte Brown is added to Y9 form tutor
emails? The full list of names who should be included is here:

Miss Chambers
Mrs Reeder
Mr Deamer
Mr Bryan
Miss Brown
Mr Tilbrook
Ms Collins
Miss Rogers
Mrs Field
Miss Arksey
Miss Sinclair
Mrs Parkinson
Mr Dodson
Mr Gibson
Miss Paver

We have had a router installed on a Building Management System at Badger
Hill to allow for remote access for myself and Mike Wells. We have
installed the Zero Tier system to allow us access. There seems to be a
problem with us gaining access and as such we need to have outgoing
internet on Port 9993. If needed I can give details for the BMS
service provider.

,T20231218.0023,IWB Braeburn,"Morning,

We have an IWB in one of our classrooms which will only display when the
desktop monitor is unplugged. If the desktop monitor is connected, the IWB
displays 'no signal'. This was 'fixed' by you, a couple of weeks ago, but
the issue has returned. The problem seems to be activated by opening
anything on powerpoint????

Thanks

than forwarding copies of each speakers presentation as they have done in

there be anyone available on the day if any tech issues arise?

Hi Vanessa,

I'm just trying to open Mimi's Yr 11 Full Report in the 'linked documents'
on SIMS but it won't open - it's coming up as gobbledy gook!!!

Is there any chance of sending me a copy of her report please and letting
me know her target grade?

The target grade is the thing that I most need now, but will also need a
copy of her report next week if that's at all possible?

Thank you!
Louise

The CST offices at the Leyes will be closed from Friday the 22nd December
until Monday the 8th January, so I will need to work from home during this
period.

Subsequently, I was wondering if you have a spare monitor which I could use
/ be delivered to my home address next week?

If not, please could confirm what cable I would need to connect my laptop
to a Dell Monitor, as there is potentially a monitor that I may be able to
use from the office, should you not have a spare monitor I can use?

Please see attached below a photo of my laptop / details of the model.

,T20231215.0131,Fwd: PMAT email issue,"Good afternoon,

Please could somebody get in touch with this Governor who is also having
issues with their email accounts. It appears that he has two accounts that
you manage - one with us (STB) and the other with St Paul's Primary. His
personal email address is below to contact him.

We've had a lot of issues with Governor accounts recently with people not
able to access them and it's of high importance that our school Governors
are able to do so. Following on from previous Governor account issues, it
seems significantly more effective having yourselves get in touch directly
to resolve the issues rather than the MAT passing messages between the two
parties.

Many thanks,
Mia

I am in L34 for a set task with my Year 13's and there is no access to the
Xerox printer from any of our computers. We will need to print out their
exam notes at the end of P3 on Tuesday from this room as they only have 4
hours to prep and then need to hand in these notes, so we need to have
access restored by then.

We have searched for the printer but only the Follow Me Toshiba is visible.

Hello

I use a website called 'Get Epic'. It is full of online books for children
to read- some of which read to the children so they are great for EAL and
SEN kids. This week, I've tried to log on but it says the site is blocked.
Please can I have access again?
The address is :

This is the error David received trying to access his new school Google
account from home.
He is a new member of Science. He starts in Jan, and I think he wants to
access the Google drive to look at his department curriculum documents and
lesson plans etc.
He was looking quite stressed yesterday when he came to see me (to get into
SIMS and Classcharts).
He thought his passwords didn't work, but they did when I showed him which
to enter where.
He may need a phone call, to talk his way through...or some screen shots?

Hi Vanessa
Sorry to trouble you again!
Just having a play and cannot get into my new AHS Google account or the
remote desktop from home using my school email address and password.
Any idea what I might be doing wrong? There is a message saying that my
login was successful but does not meet the ""criteria necessary to access

Help!!!

I am aware that two factor authentication is required for emails, but
cannot be sure this is the issue so have included our IT support in this
email chain.
I'm confident Giles can see what the problem is, and sort your Google
access out.

Are you accessing the remote desktop via the Archbishop Holgate
website...scrolling down and selecting it here?:

This requires the username and password you would use when turning on a
school computer, not email.

What’s really strange is that it worked all last week when she was at Selby
High so I don’t know what’s causing an issue now.

I’ll see if I can get the laptop here. It’s her last day at Selby tomorrow
though so I might just get some text books to her.

Hi

Please could someone take a look at the computer in the music room at Haxby
Road.
The wire connecting the computer to the speaker is faulty and works only
intermittently.
I really need to be able to use it in my music lessons but sometimes
struggle to get any sound out of the speaker, just a low white noise.

Thank you

Below is a copy of one of many data breaches where Nina Thompson is getting
C. Thompson's emails. I understand why it is happening because C.Thompson
is known as Nina. People are finding that email and using it. I am thinking
the only way around this after several attempts at stopping the breaches
with more subtle changes to emails is to change the emails to:
N.thompsongovernor@
and n.tompson (for Christina as people do not seem to know her as Christina)

Can you all confirm your agreement to this or suggest a better alternative

Hi both



Another Teams related homework issue; sorry. Same as a previous time: first time he went to look at the music homework it logged him in fine. He went back later to do it, at which point he was asked to put in his password … and then it didn’t log him in fine – it didn’t log him in at all, and we got the same old same old error message.



We’ve gone through the same rigmarole as always: clearing cookies, trying incognito browsers, trying different devices and different operating systems etc etc etc. I know all IT teams around the world work on the premise that the user is somehow doing something wrong, but I can assure you that we’re not. (I’m even a Microsoft Certified Educator, for my sins, so I know my way around their products, and know how to Google for work arounds, and for the sake of speeding up these exchanges I go back and re-do every suggestion I’ve been given.)



It keeps coming back to the same fundamental thing: Sam’s Teams account allows him to access material once, and then the password is not recognised again.



I’m sure you’re as frustrated at getting these emails as we are sending them, but given that this has happened three or four times now I think we’ve reached the stage where something more far-reaching than trying the same things over and over is required! Sorry

Subject: Re: Teams - Sam Venn

Good evening,

I have asked out tech team if they had any further suggestions which might help with the login challenges Sam is having.

These are the things they suggested trying:



Can you ask that they make sure when using Teams in a browser that there isn't another account signed into the browser, they could also do with checking to see which Microsoft account is signed into the device itself if it's a windows machine, this might perhaps be causing some issues.

They could also try using incognito/in-private browsing windows in their browser and see if that fixes the issue.



I know they may sound obvious but I know from using my own computers at home, sometimes once a Microsoft login is used on a machine, it sometimes gets stuck in the background and it is very difficult to entirely disconnect it!



I hope this is helpful.

Kind regards

Sarah

Hate to say it, but we're back to square one with teams. Sam tried on Thurs 26 to log on with his new password (which worked on the Monday) but once again, across multiple systems and different ways of trying to access Teams, he's being told the email and password combination aren't working. Hugely frustrating for us and I'm sure you too.



Teams access for the multiple organisations I use it for as part of my job work well, so it's not a problem with Microsoft products per se from this location. But clearly there's something up with Sam's account that is causing issues with the password.



Sorry to ask, but could you have a look again at this after half term?

I also must apologise as looking back at the email chain, I think I only sent the image to the ICT teacher rather than your whole email and, therefore, I don't think she realised that you had already tried this.  So, apologies for your frustration, I think in my haste to sort this I failed to send her all the information.



Please be assured that we will sort this out and that Sam will not be in any trouble for failing to do my homework.



Best wishes

Donna Stockill (M

Hi,

I'm in one of the lower prep classrooms, and none of the children seem to be able to sign into the OneDrives, so none of the files they've saved in their documents are accessible. I actually don't seem to be signed in properly myself - the OneDrive icon on the taskbar is showing as 'signing in'. I'm having a similar but different problem myself - I can see files in my documents folders, but I can't open many of them. Not sure just yet whether it's a geographic problem to do with the wifi in the room - I'm going to take them to a different room to see if it's any better elsewhere.

,T20231213.0069,Internet issue,"Hello,

I have copied and pasted my previous email below:

Would it be possible for someone to check if there’s an issue with my
internet access? More and more I am unable to access the internet and
therefore Arbor and emails when at school (I’m having to send this from my
phone as I can’t access the internet again in the staff room). It’s usually
fine when I’m in R1 however when I teach in other classrooms there is often
an issue. Period 4 today I was in P1 and couldn’t do the register or watch
a programme on YouTube that I wanted to show, however Alistair who was in
that room this morning said he hasn’t had any issues.

Just as a follow-up to this…I’ve just been teaching in B8 and again, the
internet wouldn’t work and I couldn’t therefore get onto Arbor.


Thanks,

Layla

of mine have been showing the error since P4 yesterday when there was an
internet issue.

 error 400
""The server cannot process the request because it is malformed. It should
not be retired. That's all we know""

student work. Some students have been successful and others have sent it

Other students do not have a G2 printer as an option and so the only way
they can get a hard copy is to email the file to another student so that
they can print it for them.

Hi Katie,

Could we please direct this email towards the AHT who can investigate this under our behaviour curriculum. The booking system should indicate whose in the room. I'm unsure which year group uses this for year detentions- it used to be year 8. But we can't tolerate this kind of vandalism.

Thanks

James called me on Friday and chatted about this. We hold our detentions in there but often sit with them the whole time. If we are not in there we do bob in and out a lot. Yesterday every time I went in students were not messing with the keyboards.
We don't have another room I am afraid, and we are keeping our eye on it. It could just as easily be a cover lesson, there have been a few in there where it has been a bit more unruly than usual.
Thank you

Is there a possibility for a mobile hotspot to be set up for the classes

To: D Allen <d.allen@mce.hslt.academy>, L Hill <l.hill@mce.hslt.academy>


Today we have our GCSE mock art exam.  Due to internet/wifi etc problems we
had to think creatively to solve many issues around not being able to email
images, load images and send images.

The service was pretty non existent and at one point only allowed us to
email Charlotte and seek better connection elsewhere in school. Pure
desperation led us also to allow a student to access his 4G and a personal
email account.

We know that you are aware of this and that this has now been escalated,
but it caused more staff having to intervene and stress.

It was also a lesson that still may not be learnt for students to be more
prepared!

Many thanks
Helen and Charlotte

,T20231212.0091,SCCM Not Deploying,"Hi Dan,

Got an odd one with SCCM for you. Across at least three different types of
computer in three different places and seemingly using multiple deployment
options (PXE Booting and bootable media). I can't get a task sequence to
start.

PXE Booting through UEFI gets to the ""Starting PXE over IPv4"" stage and
hangs there until it fails, PXE in Legacy mode gives me a PXE-E53 error
message, and launching media through an existing OS or booting into some
bootable media gives me a ""0x80004005"" code with a message saying it can't
retrieve the task sequence policy from the server.

I was able to successfully deploy to 12 laptops last week across Thursday
and Friday, so I'm not too sure what's happened here.

Thanks,

Hi charlotte,

We've been having lots of conversations lately with schools and colleges
across the UK, all about digital transformation and the role that BT can
play in supporting you.

As part of our dedicated education team, I'm here to help you deliver all
aspects of your ICT strategy, from simple IT hardware supply to
coordinating complex technology solutions.

Below are just some of the ways we can help. I'd love the opportunity to
talk more about your school or college's plans and how we can support you.
Just reach out.

Kind regards,

Richard Donnelly

As before - my laptop does not stay charged and can only be used with my charging cable plugged in which is an issue due to me not being desk/office based and needing to be on the move with my device observing children in classes etc. I was told that if the replacement battery did not improve my device it would be replaced due to it being one of the oldest laptops in school.

I am in school everyday this week so please can you arrange for my laptop to be changed at your earliest convenience.

lights have to be off to see it, which doesn't really work in a practical
environment. It now is also so blurry it's not very easy to read for the
students or for me as a dyslexic.
It's becoming very hard to teach!

As discussed please see our programme for this year. As you can see all our
trainers will be set up for a 10am start, so IT support would just be
required from 8am, to make sure the PA system is working in the hall for
Mark, and then till 10.30am when everyone is in their sessions.

Hope that helps and we really do appreciate the support.

Hi Ladies

Please could you speak to vital about the new printer?
There is no 'print release' option so when I print from my computer it is
just releasing everything for everyone automatically. Meaning things are
getting mixed up, stuff is getting lost and confidential documents on
children are printing and sitting up in that room until collected!

Could you ask them to set it up how we had it before where you had to go up
ad click print release?

Thanks

,T20231212.0018,Smart Board software,"Hi there,

This has been an ongoing request from members of my team since about Easter
time but has become more relevant since September.

We have some classrooms with smartboards in them that have not had the
smart software installed. While they are plug and play in most regards the
smart software, and in particular the smart ink, makes them much more
versatile and allows us to use them as we should.  One member of staff who
uses smart notebook for all her lessons can't prepare lessons anywhere else
as the software is not on the computers in the workroom - it used to be
before everything was restored following the cyber attack.

At the beginning of the year Ben indicated that he could just add the smart
software to the global package that would then install on every machine but
has since backtracked and said that for some reason that won't work and
needs to be installed individually on every machine. If that is the case
then can someone please get on a do it - prioritise the classrooms that
have had the boards installed as well as the department workrooms so we can
plan but please stop just telling us that there hasn't been time.  It has
been a request for about 9 months now and has been an urgent request since
September.

Thanks, Duncan

,T20231212.0014,New IWB in S14,"I wanted to flag that there are some dodgy connections with the IWB in S14
and while they are generally a minor irritation I'd rather flag it now
while this board is still (presumably) under warranty. The board often
shows no input at all and the only way I can get an input is to literally
unplug every wire and plug them all back in again.  There are 2 hdmi ports
on the side of the board - if I plug into hdmi 1 the board continually
flickers. If I plug into hdmi 2 the board occasionally flickers. I suspect
that with all the moving around this board has done one or both of these
ports have become slightly compromised leading to these issues.  If that is
the case then it probably needs flagging with the installers.
Alternatively it could be an issue with the computer or the cabling
although the cabling has been changed since it was installed and hasn't
changed the performance.

possible to make these changes to her account?  As she hasn't started yet I
don't know if it would be easier to simply delete the Rachel Rice account
and set up a new account in the name Rachel Wright?

Many thanks
Jo

,T20231211.0032,TE and Yearsley Grove,"Hi Holly and Jonny,

I have tried to set up Teddy Ellerby's email account on his braille note touch plus, but it says it cannot connect to the server.  It is definitely connected to the server - google opens appropriately.  I have tried doing this near his classroom and also in the server room in case it was just too far away, but that didn't make a difference.  I have a support call with Humanware, the assistive tech company who provide this device, on Friday 15th at 12 noon at school to try to trouble shoot. Jonny can you be there too?  I am wondering if it's a firewall or some security setting that I can't change?

If you want to check this before, I am in Yearsley Grove from 11am on Thursday and 11am on Friday.

Thanks for your help with this.

Best wishes,
Abi

them on Wednesday.

We are no longer receiving emails when a purchase order has been raised,
when a PO has been authorised, or by the looks of their investigation any
emails sent from PSF direct are not sending (this does make sense as there
have been increased calls from suppliers asking for copies of their

*Hi Abbie, It looks like your workflow emails are failing to send due to
   incorrect SMTP settings. I can see that you are on your own SMTP Mailing
   solution so I will need your IT to confirm the full SMTP details are
   correct, its likely a password has perhaps been changed but needs updating
   within your workflow. Please ask your IT if anything was changed on the
   30th November Here is what we have on record within your workflow that
   needs confirming SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com <http://smtp.gmail.com> SMTP
   Port: 587 SMTP User: finance@ebor.academy SMTP Password: <please confirm
   this so I can update Workflow> I also double checked your Document Emailer
   which will be using your same SMTP Details and I was also unable to email
   an order to myself so the SMTP settings have either been updated by your IT

Hi both



Another Teams related homework issue; sorry. Same as a previous time: first time he went to look at the music homework it logged him in fine. He went back later to do it, at which point he was asked to put in his password … and then it didn’t log him in fine – it didn’t log him in at all, and we got the same old same old error message.



We’ve gone through the same rigmarole as always: clearing cookies, trying incognito browsers, trying different devices and different operating systems etc etc etc. I know all IT teams around the world work on the premise that the user is somehow doing something wrong, but I can assure you that we’re not. (I’m even a Microsoft Certified Educator, for my sins, so I know my way around their products, and know how to Google for work arounds, and for the sake of speeding up these exchanges I go back and re-do every suggestion I’ve been given.)



It keeps coming back to the same fundamental thing: Sam’s Teams account allows him to access material once, and then the password is not recognised again.



I’m sure you’re as frustrated at getting these emails as we are sending them, but given that this has happened three or four times now I think we’ve reached the stage where something more far-reaching than trying the same things over and over is required! Sorry



Ed

Subject: Re: Teams - Sam Venn

Good evening,

I have asked out tech team if they had any further suggestions which might help with the login challenges Sam is having.

These are the things they suggested trying:



Can you ask that they make sure when using Teams in a browser that there isn't another account signed into the browser, they could also do with checking to see which Microsoft account is signed into the device itself if it's a windows machine, this might perhaps be causing some issues.

They could also try using incognito/in-private browsing windows in their browser and see if that fixes the issue.



I know they may sound obvious but I know from using my own computers at home, sometimes once a Microsoft login is used on a machine, it sometimes gets stuck in the background and it is very difficult to entirely disconnect it!



I hope this is helpful.

Kind regards

Sarah

Hate to say it, but we're back to square one with teams. Sam tried on Thurs 26 to log on with his new password (which worked on the Monday) but once again, across multiple systems and different ways of trying to access Teams, he's being told the email and password combination aren't working. Hugely frustrating for us and I'm sure you too.



Teams access for the multiple organisations I use it for as part of my job work well, so it's not a problem with Microsoft products per se from this location. But clearly there's something up with Sam's account that is causing issues with the password.



Sorry to ask, but could you have a look again at this after half term?



Ed

Dear Mr Venn



I am sorry to send another email, however, I wanted to let you know that I have also alerted Sam's Head of Year to the problem you are having with Teams.



I also must apologise as looking back at the email chain, I think I only sent the image to the ICT teacher rather than your whole email and, therefore, I don't think she realised that you had already tried this.  So, apologies for your frustration, I think in my haste to sort this I failed to send her all the information.



Please be assured that we will sort this out and that Sam will not be in any trouble for failing to do my homework.



Best wishes

Much as the new computers in S4 are fab, there are only 28.
I teach classes with 30 + students in some groups and Ideally would like
each student to have access to their own PC.
If there is any chance an extra four computers could be added to S4 that
would help massively

Good afternoon all,

Please can you tell me what Yr7 will be learning after Christmas and the
location of the schemes of work on the systems. The next cohort going into
the AP will be year 7 and they need to be taught the same as what is
happening in the mainstream.

The students will be in for the full term due the half terms only being 5
weeks long and they will transition out over the last 2/3 weeks as
necessary.

As a part of ensuring the provision being provided is equitable with the
mainstream, I would like you to visit the AP twice (or your second in
charge if you have one) to check the quality of work being produced by the
students. This can be scheduled with Warren to take place at any point
during each half term.

I need to know this information by Wednesday 13th December.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Many thanks,

Claire

,T20231208.0111,Badger Hill,"Good Morning,

I phoned in earlier with a problem regarding Google Slides and a new
function which allows gifs and stickers to be used in slides. We had an
incident of a child using this function and searching inappropriate words.
I have logged this with Talk Straight and spoken to Angela Oswald as part
of the central team.

Her advice was to block 'slides' for the children's use for now until we
can assess the situation. Is this something which we can do?

I can get as far as inputting her email address, getting to the Microsoft

and says to contact the administrator.

Is there anything that you're able to do to support please - I think it's
the 2FA that's causing an issue and poor network.

something on G Drive that I need to do and not sure how to do or free next

Yesterday I was looking at the audit logs for another issue when I noticed
this action from my account which seems to originate from Ireland. When I
saw it, I immediately changed my password and revoked access to devices and
programs I do no use.

I've since spoken to Laurence and he has suggested that seen as this user
left over two years ago, this could be Wonde removing old accounts. This
does sound plausible to me, but I wanted to check with you guys to be sure,
as I thought Wonde used a Vital Google account and not mine, and that I
joined the school after Wonde was set up, so I'm not quite sure why it
would be using my account.

If it is Wonde using my account does this pose any issues?

,T20231207.0172,reactivate an email address,"Hi,

I would like to reactivate an email account for Victoria Dale
(v.dale@ebor.academy). Victoria was a leaver on the system in October from
Park Grove Primary Academy but she has since joined the Central Support
Team as a supply teacher.

I have filled out the google sheet to transfer Victoria to the CST but I
wasn't sure if there is anything else I needed to do to reactivate an email
address?

Kind regards

,T20231207.0112,Internet access to laptop,"HI Tom
Please can you come to see me in the HT's admin office?
The laptop I need to use for this afternoon's Admissions Committee says it
can't connect to the internet. This is the same laptop Heather uses for SLT
work.
I understand from Heather that there is a new NPCAT internet connection
which needs to be set up on each laptop.
I'll need it fixing by 1.30pm if that's ok?
Thanks, Julia

Thanks previously for your help with the advent calendar!

New request....!

I want to get students onto Duolingo.

When they tried to log on with google, it blocked them.
This is the link they are using to get onto the duolingo schools classroom
that I have set up.
www.duolingo.com/classroom/xqccjc

I think I got Carter to send a permission request just to see whether that
worked.

Is it possible to change settings so they can log on?

Thanks

We have an Entry Sign In screen at reception and we need to update the
policy that people have to accept when they visit the school.  We have
contacted the software company and they have given us instructions on how
to do this, but the policy that we need to change is not stored in the
C:Drive on the reception computer, and we don't know where it is stored.
There are other Entry Sign documents stored on this computer, but not the
one we need to change.

Could somebody assist with this?  Either in locating where the policy is
stored so we can replace it, or in creating a new link to my computer? A
suggestion was that it could have been be saved on the C:Drive of the old
reception computer?

I hope that you are well and not completely snowed under with Smoothwall
related tasks…
Jack Nelson looked for you yesterday but must have missed you, so I hope
you don’t mind me emailing on his behalf. I know that you have reset
Smoothwall for him so that it starts and ends when it is supposed to, but
he says that his iPad is glitching and freezing and inserting lots of
slides into every piece of work.
Is there a good time for him to come and talk to you, please?
Many thanks,
Clare

Craig, as per our communication earlier. We plan on delivering more of
these tests next Thursday 15th December for 160 students.

It would be really useful if the 'Kiosk' function can be set up and working
prior to the exam. If you could let me know if we need to use different
logins etc beforehand too as I am not here the day before the exams.

Hi Sarah

It's looking like I've missed the boat with this but I have videos on Stream Classic that I need moving to the sharepoint Stream. I think a deadline may have passed but is there a way I can access my old stuff? A lot is embedded in resources.

Thanks

Hello

The printer in the English work room at Manor CE Academy is continually jamming.

I have removed multiple jams and realigned and replaced the paper in the drawer, but the jamming continues.

It also continues to print very messily - with colour  streaks on black and white copies.

I am aware that we are awaiting parts for a service so this may be the issue.

I am not sure if this is an issue for Vital or Kyocera, so have included both.

(English Team - printer is still working intermittently)

Thanks
Ruth

Subject: CPOMS Integration


Morning Adam,

I wondered if you could help me please?

We use a system called CPOMS to record all of our safeguarding concerns. There is a function within CPOMS called Integration where I can apparently set up my login to integrate with Smoothwall to alert me to any children trying to access inappropriate content. Under the new KCSIE (Keeping Children Safe in Education) guidelines for schools, our Filtering and Monitoring systems don't meet the new criteria and Ebor are looking for additional methods in order to fulfil this new criteria for when Ofsted visit schools. On CPOMS I've requested to 'integrate' Smoothwall but I'm not sure if I need to do anything else - the status says 'pending.' Rebecca McGuiin from Ebor has asked me to trial this function to see how it works. Is this function on CPOMS familiar to you?

I've copied a link to try and help with this but I'm not an IT person - https://monitorhelp.smoothwall.com/hc/en-gb/articles/9426928413852-Integrating-CPOMS-with-Monitor-UK-#h_01H9MPRA88CG4WHQ53VHZEVJEZ

,T20231206.0101,Windows taskbar,"Hi, as I'm only in my second week I'm trying to get things working in a way
I am used to. I'm used to an office/outlook environment so am trying to get
my head around google.

I have several things in my taskbar currently, one of which is chrome. I
work with several things in chrome open at once which I am regularly
switching between - calendar, gmail, google maps, various websites etc.

I wondered if there's a way to pin a specific window or tab to the task
bar, rather than having to hover over chrome and then look for the one I
want.

The problem is that if I've been in an email and clicked to open a link
say, but forgotten to open this in a new window. Then I'm on the phone with
someone and quickly want to go back to my emails, or calendar, they can
become hidden as the day goes on and I'm madly searching through all my
open windows for the right tab.

Hope that makes sense.

I've just been exploring Google Drive too and it asked if I wanted to
download the desktop app - I started this process thinking that this would
allow me to have this on the taskbar for similar reasons but I stopped as
wasn't sure if I should do this without checking with you first. Please
could you advise on this and if I can do the same for other things. I've
hunted in settings but can't find a way to separate things in the way I
need. Not loving Google if I'm honest!

The printer in the English work room at Manor CE Academy is continually
jamming.

I have removed multiple jams and realigned and replaced the paper in the
drawer, but the jamming continues.

It also continues to print very messily - with colour  streaks on black and
white copies.

I am aware that we are awaiting parts for a service so this may be the
issue.

I am not sure if this is an issue for Vital or Kyocera, so have included
both.

(English Team - printer is still working intermittently)

,T20231206.0044,New Kiosk Mode Request (FAO Russ),"Morning,
this is not urgent at all - Complete as and when you have spare time.

I would like to have another Kiosk mode setup to help with the GL Assessments Website.

Presently they are booking out a couple of Chromebook Trolleys and logging all these in with the same account (gl@asa.hslt.academy) then using a chrome bookmark to load up the GL Assessment page.
Not the end of the world, However in best practice we should be trying to avoid using the same account even more so over so many devices at once.

When you have time can you please create me a new KIOSK OU in google which enforces the Assessment site.
In an ideal world it would be great to have a main OU for GL Assessments then sub ou for trolleys that are moved into this main OU

Other option would be single OU and I will move the trolleys to them and back out again.",,Archbishop Sentamu Academy,Primary Address,"Pritchard, Mr. Craig",Complete,Low,Verbal,,,,Secondary School Escalation,Service Request,ATG MSP Support,ATG Chromebook Device,Management Request,,,,,,,,,VYL - Incidents,06/12/2023 09:57 AM,"Pritchard, Craig",,11/12/2023 08:40 AM,29/12/2023 11:27 AM,11/12/2023 08:39 AM,"Pritchard, Craig",,"Pritchard, Craig",Not Visible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lack of Platform Access | Lack of Product Knowledge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hello

I am still having issues with the cyber dolls, from what I have read online
and you tube videos it's not connected on the desktop computer still but
the ICT guy has been on numerous occasions? this is what im getting on the
screen? i believe this should be green on the bottom when watching
instructions to be able to add the dolls to the system? Are you able to
flag this with the ICT people as I say he has been on numerous occasions.

Thank you Sophie

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the ongoing technical
issues with my computer, which have significantly hindered my ability to
conduct lessons.

Despite having raised the issue multiple times, the problem persists, and I
am frustrated by the apparent lack of urgency and effort in resolving this
matter. Today alone, my computer has unexpectedly shut down three times
during crucial teaching sessions, causing a severe disruption to the
learning experience of my pupils.

These repeated interruptions not only compromise the quality of education I
strive to provide but also create a frustrating environment for both
students and myself. Best wishes, Nathan

How to Fix It
An email admin at huntingtonschool.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that blocks messages that meet certain conditions, and it appears that your message has met one or more of those conditions.
*         Check the text above for a custom message from the email admin that may help explain why your message was blocked and how you might be able to fix it. For example, removing prohibited words from the message or sending the message from a different email account may be sufficient to deliver your message.
If you've tried and you're still not able to fix the problem, consider contacting the email admin at huntingtonschool.onmicrosoft.com to discuss what to do. While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance for how to do so.
________________________________

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.7.1_ETR

This error occurs because an email admin at huntingtonschool.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message.

In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at huntingtonschool.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.

Hi Sarah



I hope you are well?



Green Hammerton’s Open Value Subscription Education Solutions Agreement (Microsoft Licensing) anniversary date has expired. Please could you send me the current FTE staff count so we can raise a quote. Please see below on how to calculate the current FTE count:



MICROSOFT OPEN VALUE SUBSCRIPTION - EDUCATIONAL SOLUTIONS 2023 Anniversary

As a reminder, the OVS-ES charge is calculated by counting the following employees:

  *   head teacher
  *   deputy and assistant head teachers
  *   teachers
  *   teaching assistants
  *   departmental assistants
  *   administration staff

The following employees do not need to be counted:

  *   cleaning staff
  *   catering staff
  *   midday supervisory assistants
  *   site maintenance staff

You also do not need to count any employees, whatever their role, who work under 200 hours per year. That is approximately 5 hours a week for term time only staff. If your employee count increases or decreases during the year, this only needs to be declared at the renewal of your agreement. Students do not need to be counted at any point as they are eligible to use the Microsoft products covered by OVS-ES without any additional charge.



Regards



Adam

I will ask our IT team (copied in) as to why it won't show / blocked by
Smoothwall.

Mr Crolla - we have a work experience app that students require access to.
It is new this year and has just been launched in the last couple of weeks,
but it has been reported that it's blocked in school. Could you have a look
into it please?

It's the attached app.

Many thanks,

,T20231205.0015,Wonde users not match to Google accounts,"Hello Vital,

Jane at Fishergate contacted me to say that two of their new starters have
wonde logins that aren't working. I just tested at home, and the wonde
login works - but I couldn't go to classroom, error ""The logged in user is
not associated to a single sign on user."" I'm assuming that it may give a
similar error when they attempt to use the wonde login to log in to a
Chromebook?

The users in question are Gawa Namgyel and Lauren Kandeel, but there may be
other new starters with a similar problem - someone previously reported the
magic badge not working and I tested it, found it was and reported back but
if the issue they were having was the same then the badge does work - it
just doesn't SSO for Google.

Please can you investigate why the SSO isn't matching up?

Hi Hannah
Could you report it to Vital? It looks like Googlemail is
blocking/rejecting when you're sending an Accident Report (or when someone
submits one, your old address is not redirecting it to your new email
address).

I've checked your settings on Parago and you have successfully updated your
email address.

:/

Sorry.

I've just been made aware that no one can call me on the Cloudya phone
system unless I log into it. Please could you tell me if there is a way to
set Cloudya to always open if I have restarted or closed my laptop?

I've looked in the startup Apps and can't see it in there to switch this on
and I've also looked in the Cloudya settings but can't see it in there
either.

Many thanks

sent an email last week and was informed that it would be sorted by close

Can I ask that this is dealt with at the first opportunity, at present it
does not present a safe or conducive environment for learning to take place.

,T20231204.0100,Re: BTEC Sport,"Morning Nick,

I've given Mike in IT the two videos for Andrew Taylor and Charlie Hunt
this morning.

Just Max, Evelyn and Luca to deliver now. I have spoken to all three about
delivering, so they should be ready to deliver next session.

For the remaining practicals (once the three above have delivered), would
you be able to give guidance as to who should complete a new video
submission?

Is it up to the individual if they would like to lead again, or is there
anyone who failed to meet criteria in their first attempt?

I'll wait for your guidance on this.

Many thanks,
Toby

Hi Adam,

Apologies if you’re the wrong person to send this to but perhaps you could send it on? I’ve spoken to Leigh Farrow and he said that it’s Vital who need to fill it out.

Sorry, I’ve never sure who to contact for my schools, if you can give me a name/names, I’ll stop bothering you!

Hi Nicola,

Hope you are well.

We have been waiting for the attached document to be returned from your IT department following our engineer visit on 22.09.23 as the IP line is still in fault.

Please can you advise when this can be completed and returned?

,T20231203.0015,Teams,"Good morning

For several months now when I try to log onto a Microsoft Teams meeting
these are the steps I have to take to join the meeting, is there anything
that can be done to enable me to join first time like I used to be able to?
This is on my PC (and my laptop when that was working too).

I always try the click here to join, but it just whirls and doesn't join,

Click join on the web and open a new window, I put in the meeting number
and password and enter but again this doesn't work.

I then go back to the original click here to join the meeting and it works,
putting up with the red circle on the tab quickly and then the
pre-meeting window pops up.

It's really frustrating so if you can help that would be great.

Many thanks

Jenny

outside of the traditional working day. Where emails are received after
6pm, over the weekend or during a holiday period, it is likely that a
response will be given during the school’s normal working hours. Thank you

Hi Jo,

I hope all is well!

As mentioned earlier this week, I am having issues with my laptop at home. This only started happening after an update that went through on Saturday.

I have tried turning on and off a few times (full shut down), turning the Proxy settings on and off and also waiting for it to load but nothing is working.

I have attached a photo of the error message and also the sticker on the bottom. This was the only sticker I could find so hopefully this is what you needed.

I have it here so if you need anything else let me know and I'll pop down to the office.

Thanks
Hayley

We were wondering if somebody could possibly come into Elvington as soon as

We need them hopefully for our nativity on Monday 11th December.

I am the Spanish teacher in 2 ebor schools.

This year we have prepared an advent calendar for our partner schools in
Spain.
They have sent there's as a slides on google drive which we can open.

Unfortunately they cannot access from our drive.
I tried sending as a pdf but the ppt features don't work

I tried sending as a ppt but it is too big to send on google drive

I tried sending as a ppt from my hotmail account but the one drive link is
ony accessible to the teacher in spain and not everyone

Please can you lift restrictions of the following google slides so that the
schools in spain can access it? Also it is going to be sent on school
newsletters too so I wonder if we will have the same access problems.

Or please can you send an alternative solution .

They have tried opening it today and it didn't work :-(

,T20231201.0033,Re: Reading Plus and Edulink,"Edulink is not something that can be just linked with something else. If
there is another school in the trust doing it already then if you can let
me know which one and I will see how they have done it - but as far as I am
aware edulink just links to sims and sims doesn't link to reading plus.

Dear all

Wellbeing in Mind from the NHS are going to start to work in the school
very soon.  However, before they can do this they need to complete a survey of
all the students.

In order to complete the survey Year 7, 8 and 9 will do it lessons, however
we need to use PM form time for everyone else.  Please can you complete the
survey with your forms.

I have mapped out the following times when we can get them into Form Rooms
(those in Form Rooms, obviously swap with the form they have come from when
the room is being used).

Over the next 2 weeks this survey MUST be completed.  Please use the
following presentation to introduce it to them:

- Set a scheduled homework weekly for students to complete their
reading plus (KS3) only.
- Set a reminder for students to complete their reading plus, 2 days before
the due date?
- Send messages to the English team when a student has levelled up

Thank you,

,T20231130.0206,Laptop,"Hi both

Thank you for the loan of the old student laptop from technology.

Unfortunately it has not worked out.

I tried using it to plan a lesson on just before I left school tonight.

Lee, I appreciate that you said it was even older and much more slower than
mine but it was beyond unbelievable. All I asked the laptop to do was to
turn on and open up the smartboard software so I could start planning.

I was waiting for the laptop for over 20 minutes to even open up the
software. I had to give up on it and go home before it even managed this.

I’m sorry but this is not a feasible solution. I just haven’t got the time
to wait for half an hour plus just to get a program open so I can even
start planning. Trying just to plan 5 lessons will include waiting nearly 3
hours for programs to open! Plus if it takes this long to open programs it
just isn’t going to run the program properly to be able to use it to plan.

Given the weather looks good ( if chilly), it should be possible to do 3
groups in one go.
Option A: Andy outside the SH on grass, Luca and Lillie inside SH.
Option B if any of them are away. Sub in Callum.
Charlie can only really do golf if KR has had time to get the golf stuff
out of storage AND there is an extra member of staff to supervise him (AK).

Andy Taylor leading rugby.
His plan is not worth sharing.

Luca Hopkins leading badminton.

If they go to Mike at the end he will get the videos to me.

All kit should be in the downstairs store just inside the SH.
I fully expect some of them to be away so I will tell everyone that they
need to be ready to lead (including Max) that way we should at least get 2
done.)

We have just seen the new printer in Exams.

We are aware you know about it, and it even looks like you have kept our
links to the machine (interim and full), thank you Giles.

Could someone take a look at the printer settings please, as when I run
test prints using the Interim (current default) and even choosing my own
settings, the two sheets are not stapling despite it being set to do so.
I've checked the printer for staples (full in all 3 areas). I've double
checked the printer settings several times, to be quite sure.
I now assume it's something more software based, or that the printer is
broken already??

Can anyone help, as we need to print Y13 reports tomorrow.

Mia Mason's work has disappeared from google classroom from her assessment
google document.

This is the document where her work was and now no longer is:

 Mia Mason Year 13 - Task 1 Unit 2 Applied Psych...
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jZcgfgrSazeQBh4ZcmoY_RbL0TMK9wicg7nqH0yHThs/edit?usp=drive_web>

She's saying that it says a file thats been copied by Ruby has been removed?

But not sure what that means. Ruby hasn't copied anything and all other
students have their work in this place.

Please let us know if there is anything we can do here or if you can help
at all?

,T20231129.0133,CST - Microsoft Office 365 Query,"Hi Dan,


 

I hope my email finds you well.

 

I'm working with one of our software suppliers, IMP Software, and between us we're developing a new forecasting/reporting spreadsheet.  The functionality is vastly improved if we run Office 365, currently I'm on Professional Plus 2016.  The upgrade to 365 would be required for myself and 3 Finance Business Partners, so 4 in total.

 

I know Microsoft Office licensing is a hot topic at the moment but I wanted to ask what the options are for this i.e. whether it's something we can do immediately, within weeks or months or not at all? Then it'll be the costs associated as well.

 

Any help would be much appreciated.  I could do with an initial response just with whether it's possible and, if it is, whether the installation of it could be within a week or so.  The answer will influence IMP's next steps for us that is my time pressure on this.




























Kind regards

We have a recurring issue with 2 of our laptops when connected to the IWB
in our C1 classroom. The laptop displays a blue screen and error message
with a sad face. This is repeatedly happening on both laptops when
connected to the board.

Jonny came in last week and updated the driver software on one of the
laptops but it has happened again since with both laptops.

Is it possible someone would be able to come and take a look at this
please?

Aspire day provision which is currently based at the wingfield site will be
moving to the ASSK site on preston road as of today.

We know this is short notice  - but we are due to be teaching there on
Monday.

Therefore we have a number of issues which we will need resolving ASAP:

My laop top  - does not connect to the internet when I attend the ASSK site
Claire Lancaste still requires a Windows password to enable her to print at
that site we have been told.

The students who have created logins for windows - when trying to log in
have a message stating their windows passwords have been re-set five days
ago. This has not been the case.

I think you will need the helpdesk  cc'd in that case. It should be the
same login details as your windows sign in.
@help@vitalyork.co.uk <help@vitalyork.co.uk>  Please can you contact Dawn
and resolve, the RDS service is important for Dawn to carry out her role.
I can't reset anything in relation to the Remote Desktop and the Helpdesk

 Hi Helpdeksk, 
   
 I've been given your details by Toni from Hilderthorpe Primary School as their IT provider, We have noticed that our automatic toner ordering agent “KPAX” installed on your server ""SERVER091” is not reporting back to us for 1 specific device , i suspect this is because it is on the admin side of the network and the existing installation of KPAX is on the curriculum side. 
   
 The device in question is a HP Pagewide E58650 and is located in reception (serial number CNCZL9K0F9 ) , would you be able to confirm the ip address it is on please ? and if it is indeed on the admin network then could you please click here to arrange an appointment so we can look into installing this to a desktop pc or server on the admin network

 Hi Toni, 
 
 
  
   
 
 It looks like this machine has fallen off our automatic reading software a few months back now, but I have CC’d in our support team to investigate and hopefully get it back online as soon as possible. 
 
 
  
   
 
 In the meantime, if you can send us the readings whenever you can, we can ensure that we don’t over or underestimate your next invoice. Apologies. 
 
 
  
   
 
 @Kpax install team – Could
 you please investigate device CNCZL9K0F9? It seems to have fallen off around March-time.

As you will be aware, Laura Swan and Wendy Munro are absent from work at
the moment. I am covering for Laura.

There are a number of documents, folders and calendars which we do not have
access to as Laura and Wendy would be the owners/editors. I have requested
access to a few things but i'm trying to find the best way to ensure I have
all the necessary permissions for the period of absence (which is unknown).
Things are cropping up all the time.

What is the best way to do this - do I request access when I need it or is
there a way to replicate permissions of Laura's Google account, obviously
with the necessary Trust approval?

A good starting point is to open the “*Studybugs Sync Service Configurator*”
tool from the Windows Start Menu on the SIMS server which should then
highlight any issues.

Kind regards,

Good afternoon,





Following our conversation in regards to the ticket raised for the device
6054CI and the codes for users to print and collect.



Please add to this message the IT department/IT company so that we can
liaise to get this sorted.











We can see there are another couple of devices onsite



RVF2829091 <https://fs-eu.kyocera.biz/Device/Detail/PD_KYRVF2829091>

TASKalfa 5054ci

172.25.225.227



RF80Z16541 <https://fs-eu.kyocera.biz/Device/Detail/PD_KYRF80Z16541>

TASKalfa 5053ci

172.25.225.225





We learned from Sophie though that none of the above have codes already in
it so we assume the school does not use Custom Boxes otherwise you could
have transferred them across.











The easiest way to do secure printing is private print which can be set as
per below.



It is a driver setting to be done on printing preferences on the shared
print queue on the server.











Once the above is done, only the users that sent the job will be able to
retrieve with the code they chose.



Nothing to be done in the settings on the copier, just the above driver
setup.











Alternative to private print, are custom boxes by user or by department,
for which you require to create all the desired ones and then select in the
driver Custom Box instead of Private print.







Happy for IT team to reply directly to this message if they require further
support.









Kind regards,



Dani

,T20231126.0016,Problems x 2 with laptop,"Morning

I'm bringing my laptop in as tonight it has got 2 problem:

(1) It won't open anything on Google Drive (see screenshot below)
(2) It has just told me it is completely out of storage again and won't
function properly unless more storage is released. I know you released some
last time - is there anything at all that we can do please?

Both of these issues happened simultaneously so I don't know whether they
are linked or not.

Thanks, Georgie

Please could I request a list of all staff accounts/log in and all class
log in accounts which will gain access to a hob moor oaks computer?

I would like to double check that those who should have a personal staff
account/log in do have one, or ensure that one is created if this is not
the case.

Alongside this could I also have a copy of any pupil accounts for HMO which
are within the system

The device in question is a HP Pagewide E58650 and is located in reception (serial number CNCZL9K0F9 ) , would you be able to confirm the ip address it is on please ? and if it is indeed on the admin network then could you please click here to arrange an appointment so we can look into installing this to a desktop pc or server on the admin network     Many Thanks     Steve Keddy

 Hi Toni, 
 
 
  
   
 
 It looks like this machine has fallen off our automatic reading software a few months back now, but I have CC’d in our support team to investigate and hopefully get it back online as soon as possible. 
 
 
  
   
 
 In the meantime, if you can send us the readings whenever you can, we can ensure that we don’t over or underestimate your next invoice. Apologies. 
 
 
  
   
 
 @Kpax install team – Could
 you please investigate device CNCZL9K0F9? It seems to have fallen off around March-time.

We seem to have an issue with SIMS whereby for dual reg main pupils, if we
enter a D for attendance it is not registering it in the background of
SIMs, e.g. Sadie Hunter attending Manor 5 days a week should be getting
100% a week but it’s registering it at 0 which affects our figures.

Please could someone look into this?

Hi Michelle,

I was wondering if there had been any updates on the hard drive power cable
- sorry to keep nagging!

I have the link to the presentation clicker from amazon so they could look
for the USB part or even reimburse me if they have lost it!

NORWII N29 Presentation Pointer Presenter 100M, 2.4GHz Laser Pointer
Presentation Clicker for Powerpoint Remote, Wireless Presenter with
Hyperlink & Volume Control : Amazon.co.uk: Stationery & Office Supplies

Thank you!

Hi Jane,
Please can you take a look at this for Mark. It is the same as the
conversation that we had yesterday, that staff need correct equipment to be
able to teach well.

Good morning
Last year we received 2 brand new projectors in L1 and R1.  I reported that
they have a fault and overheat after only in hour in air conditioned rooms
and switch themselves off.  A replacement was ordered for R1 as this was
the first to see the fault.  I believe this ended up in science.  So we now
still have 2 fault projectors that turn off in the middle of lessons and
can't be turned back on again for 15 mins or so.  This happened during a
year 11 lesson yesterday.  Please can it be made a priority to have these
replaced?
Thanks
Mark

The file Vital were supposed to sort yesterday is still a temp file and now
my next week's English planning has done the same thing! I've attached the
picture below of which file it is. This is obviously more of a stress at
it's the whole week's worth of planning. Could you ask them to look at my
computer as to why this keeps happening? It's in the Year 3/4 folder on the

,T20231120.0224,Read & Write software,"Good Afternoon,

Apologies to keep nagging about this, but I'm starting to become under
pressure from a teacher to get this sorted.

Do you know when the mics will be available for students to use the speech
to text feature?

Also, I have another query about it. A few teachers have asked if I can get
it on the chromebooks for them. Do you think you could add the read & write
chrome extension to all the students' google accounts?

I think we only have a short period of time for the trial and we want to
know if it fully works before this ends so we know whether to go with it or
not.

Thanks,

Sam

I am just contacting you following a conversation with Holly and Helen
Smith at Robert Wilkinson Primary Academy.

I have logged on several times to my home computer since the two-way
verification has been set up. I can log in to google and microsoft
absolutely fine and verify with my phone.
Last night, I tried to log on to my computer and received the message in
the first photo.
I know my password is correct as I have used in school today with no
problems.
I tried to request a rest and got the message emailed to my personal email
in the second photo.

I haven't been able to access anything on my google account at home for
this reason.

I really need it fixed as I only work Thursday and Friday so need to work
at home on Wednesday.

My phone number os 07412001211.
Thanks so much,
Emily

Could I ask if there's an issue with the internet? I've had real trouble
loading YouTube videos to play for students this week. Also, the videos
seem to be met with dozens of ads that are 2 minutes long and unskippable
which I don't seem to have at home and wondered if that was something to do
with the school internet? I can't do any of my listening tasks without some
sort of music playback so I need it to be working, it's cost me time in
lessons this week!

Hi Lewis,
We do not.  Sue tried to get a PA system last year purely for this reason
but there was no funds for such a thing.
I would have suggested using my speakers in 312 but since one was used for
the summer fair (which came back to my room broken - £450 to replace), I
now only have one working speaker.

Hi Alex,

Are these jobs that you've sent since it seemed to be fixed, or before?

From what I recall of the problem from last time, it's to do with the printer having some kind of 'identity crisis' - any jobs that were sent prior to the fix will probably just need to be sent again.

Fingers crossed...

Description
________________________________
Hi there,

We are using Sibelius 7.1.3 and every time we try to add a new instrument, the software crashes.

I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling both Sibelius 7 and Sibelius 7 Sounds, and I've made sure all drivers are up to date.

Do you have any advice on what else I could try to resolve this issue?

Many thanks

- click Start menu (for Windows 8/10/11, press window key then type Run, select Run)
- on search bar, type %appdata%
- click ""Roaming"" folder or press Enter
- inside the Roaming folder, go to Avid > Sibelius

- empty Recycle Bin
- restart computer

MAC:

- quit Sibelius
- open Finder then select Go > Go to folder (keyboard shortcut: Command-Shift-G) (⌘⇧G)
- type ~/Library/Application Support/Avid/Sibelius
- drag the ""Playback Configurations"" folder, ""PlogueEngine"" folder, and the PlaybackConfig.xml file to trash
- next, go to ~/Library/Application Support/Avid/Common
- delete contents in the Common folder (if there are any)
- now go to ~/Library/Preferences

Just putting this ticket here to remind you about moving the table around

myself but the cable needs extending to the PC. It doesn't have to be done
til I start teaching there in January so whenever you get a moment. It's
been moved in the same way in S21 if you need a reference.

I have asked about this previuosly as it does not work on our systems for

A few of the new PCs in the studio still aren't playing ball with some of the Cubase content. I've done what I usually do (successfully with all over dept PCs) but it hasn't worked. Are you okay to reimage them/reset them and then I'll go through my process again with the 4 PCs (they have red tape on the monitors to show you which ones).

There's a PC with green tape on the screen which always blocks the internet (joins the network ok but can't browse at all), which is annoying for the student who uses it. Could you have a look at that too please?

The studio is very quiet today so you should be able to get up anytime if you have time.

Thanks

one of the speakers said that we can get adobe express for
education deployed to our chromebooks. He said it was very simple (but is
not proving to be! as I am denied access at every opportunity by Vital
messages) . Can you please help?? I asked for clearance a couple of weeks
ago to use my email account which you gave me but when I try and fill a
form in access is denied again (I can now create an account with it but
when I fill in the form to get it for free Vital blocks it as I think you
have to be a computer administrator.

Would it be possible for one of your guys to fill the form in as you will
have access to deployment features etc?

I think you need our URN school number which is 14421

This is the only way I think we will be able to do it?

Hi Sue,

Just a small one, my youtube seems to have become stuck on restricted mode-
meaning a lot of the videos we use for lessons are unavailable for some
reason.

Could Vital have a look at this? I've tried turning it off in the normal
way but it keeps reverting on.

Hi Catherine,

Me again - Unfortunately it is smoothwalled, so they all started it and
then when it has come to the section on drugs, it is blocked and they can't
do the survey any further!

I have tried finding Mr Pattern but we have been 3 times and he is not

Good Morning Stacey,



Following the report sent, I have further discussed the IP fault with our
Engineering Director and would like to advise that the fault should not be
linked to the voltage of the system and does not need an electrician to
investigate.



Please can you inform your IT department that the monitoring unit is in IP
fault and requires investigation, if they do confirm that all is working at
your end then we would recommend an engineer to investigate our side of the
monitoring to see if it is a fault with the panel.



I apologise for the previous comments made by our engineer on the service.
We will also await to hear from you regarding the return visit to
investigate the fault on the zones mentioned within the report.



Kind Regards,

Holly

Adrian,

Just to make things easier for Vital to manage the access privileges it may be best going with something like “gov-zbanniste” whats your thoughts? For instance when we do checks if I saw a user for example 16dwingfield I would know it was a pupil and dwingfield as a staff member.

Hi Dan

The Gov test login works well.

The desktop wants cleaning up with a couple of things, SAGE, Engage, even though they don't work.

Are we at a stage where I can give Governors some login details, initially about 4.

Many thanks

Morning Adrian,



I have now setup the system so Governor's accounts can access the system via Remote Desktop. I have added a new Mapped drive on the system Q:\ which will be shared drive between all the Governors and also users at the school that require access. Currently, you’re the only user that can access this drive, The drive will appear after you log off and back in again.



There’s still a couple of permissions I want to check over but will get this completed today.



I have created a test user if you want to test,



Username: ext-gov-test

Password: TerrHall2020!



Kind Regards

Dan Wingfield
