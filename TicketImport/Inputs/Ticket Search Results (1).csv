Hi Both,

From tomorrow please could you ""suspend"" me from certain groups/alerts. I think for the sake of my inbox it is best to temporarily pause emails to:
All.pastoral
All.hoy
All.ssl
All.slt
All.removal

Sarah - can you pause the alerts from CC for C5s, missing from lesson, safeguarding?

Thanks

Kim :)

Please could I have a voicemail set up for Archbishop Holgate's School for
over the Easter Holidays? Apologies it's a bit last minute but please could
this be done today? As always, I will apply the message as I have access to
the NFON Portal, I just need the message available please.

Please could the voicemail state:
*Thank you for calling Archbishop Holgate's School. The school is now
closed for the Easter holidays and will re-open at 7.30am on Monday 17th
April. If you would like to leave a message for finance, please email
finance@pmat.academy. Please either leave a message or email the school
directly.*

Please could you also ensure that it allows callers to leave a message on
the extension 5201.

If you could let me know once it's set up and what it's called, that would
be great.

Many thanks

Hi Both,

From tomorrow please could you ""suspend"" me from certain groups/alerts. I think for the sake of my inbox it is best to temporarily pause emails to:
All.pastoral
All.hoy
All.ssl
All.slt
All.removal

Sarah - can you pause the alerts from CC for C5s, missing from lesson, safeguarding?

Thanks

Kim :)

Dear Stuart,

Something very strange has just happened and i think I may have deleted all the folders in the General Files sections of the Staff Noticeboard Team! Please help!

It's very weird. I had Teams open on both my laptop as an app and separately through the VPN at the same time as it happened to be open.

I created a New LP Peter Pan production team to put all the docs relating to the play in so the chn can access over the holiday. I did this by copying the 3F team format and adding other existing teams to it and then added the Y4 pupils individually. When I went to ad the docs into the newly created team, I couldn't believe that all the Staff ONLY docs were in files there. I was very confused, but double checked the team and members and it was definitely there. I then deleted all the folders (as I thought they had copied for some strange reason) as I was worried some of the children might try to access sensitive info.

Having done that, I uploaded the Peter Pan files and all seemed well. I then went back to the App as my Vpn wasn't allowing me to put a Gif onto the chn's message and was horrified that all the folders and docs (31, I think) that were in Staff Noticeboard General FILES have gone and seemed to have been replaced by my Peter Pan folders and docs. I have detleted these but the FILES are now empty.

I'm terrified I've deleted the lot. I'm so sorry. Can you help?

,T20230330.0078,URGENT,"Dear Stuart,

Something very strange has just happened and i think I may have deleted all the folders in the General Files sections of the Staff Noticeboard Team! Please help!

It's very weird. I had Teams open on both my laptop as an app and separately through the VPN at the same time as it happened to be open.

I created a New LP Peter Pan production team to put all the docs relating to the play in so the chn can access over the holiday. I did this by copying the 3F team format and adding other existing teams to it and then added the Y4 pupils individually. When I went to ad the docs into the newly created team, I couldn't believe that all the Staff ONLY docs were in files there. I was very confused, but double checked the team and members and it was definitely there. I then deleted all the folders (as I thought they had copied for some strange reason) as I was worried some of the children might try to access sensitive info.

Having done that, I uploaded the Peter Pan files and all seemed well. I then went back to the App as my Vpn wasn't allowing me to put a Gif onto the chn's message and was horrified that all the folders and docs (31, I think) that were in Staff Noticeboard General FILES have gone and seemed to have been replaced by my Peter Pan folders and docs. I have detleted these but the FILES are now empty.

I'm terrified I've deleted the lot. I'm so sorry. Can you help?

The good news is that Options online works from home, via the web page as
opposed to the remote desktop but the bad news is that Nova T no longer

Subject: Transport Layer Security (TLS) Update

Dear Customer,

Further to our recent email about Transport Layer Security (TLS) and how it affects the services you use with us.

We have contacted your vendor, Civica (was Nationwide), and have requested that they update their TLS to version 1.2 as a minimum.

We ask that you get in touch with them to encourage them to process the update and therefore make communications more secure for your benefit.

With your support we can accomplish this update before the 1st of May 2023 when we will no longer support TLS versions lower than 1.2.

If your vendor needs more information, please inform them to contact me.

Kind regards,

Hope Sentamu are working with Hull LA with regards to an attendance
project. To do this we are working with a company called SOL who have been
commissioned by Hull LA. The SOL colleague has requested the following:

Hi both,



Thank you for your time earlier. Looking forward to working with you and
getting the system back up and running.



*Regarding remote SIMS access I would require a SIMS account with at least
Attendance operator and Reporting permissions. We design a report in SIMS
with all the relevant contextual data and pull weekly cumulative attendance
reports. The remote access is also to support the academy throughout the
remainder of the contract to recommend appropriate interventions for
students, advise on coding procedure, perform register checks, fix the
tracker quickly if needed, and use for training. We won’t need access to
staff information or student addresses and contact details but do need
access to registers, to design reports and ability to view contextual
information (SEN, PP, FSM etc).*



*Once I have access I will update your tracker with attendance data and
return via egress.*

Is this possible please?

,T20230328.0146,Y5 touchscreen/pens in St George's York,"Hello Vital,

The IWB in Y5 is causing trouble - pens not working to write in e.g. Smart
Notebook. It is a Clevertouch touchscreen. Interactivity works for e.g
selecting and so on, and if I swap to the built-in android device the pens
do work in that. I can select the pen tool in Smart notebook and then write
or draw with the mouse but not with the touchscreen.

Apparently sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Currently it isn't
working! Class teacher is Shannon Strevett who I have cc'd - may be able to
demo the issue, and the person to coordinate with probably.

Can someone take a look please?

Thanks
Kat

We are currently looking at whether a child would be able to hear sound
from a PC, using bone conduction/ nerve type bluetooth headphones.

The PC and interactive board do not seem to have a bluetooth adaptor, so a
bluetooth usb adaptor would need to be used. Would that work due to USB
restrictions? Are there any other options?

providing a backup for our systems during this time as we are not sure
exactly when the work will take place and how long the electricity supply

Sorry I meant to send you this last week.

Initially I was using David's computer to show Wuthering heights however it has expired and he might not be able to get it again.

Would it be possible to pop down and see if you could try and get it working on the laptop in the drama studio.

The files mentioned in the attachment will be named different (possibly Ruth) as this is what my husband did on our computer at home to get it working so the file was in his name - hope that makes sense.

No worried if not able to today as I have a backup plan but if it is possible it would really help.

Thanks
Ruth

We are now coming to the end of the term and GCSE Y10 and Y11 have not been
able to print work out from the system.
Y11 students have their exam in the 2nd week back after Easter and must be
able to print out in their last 4 lessons to make sure they can test out as
well as print out the work to be put in their exam folder - this includes
their prep as well as outcomes.
it is imperative this is running as we cannot allow for any more loss of
time to do this.
After the exam they will also need to print out their last project
which was also impacted by the IT situation - which I do understand - But
this now needs resolving as  a matter of urgency.

Hello deastwood ,

I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.
Currently I have gained full access to your account. In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months .

I know all your secrets, that is your business and life . It's not my problem , I just need quick money to solve a family problem .

I can see absolutely everything on your screen , I see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages . I am using harmful software that is driver-based, which refreshes its signatures on a 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect its presence .

NOTE : I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you ( happily masturbating ) , while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment .

I can also make public all your emails and chat history but it's not important to me. I just want money for the information I have and I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening .

You will transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of GBP1500 to my Bitcoin account ( in case you don't know how to do that , it's a simple process which you can check out online ) .

This is my bitcoin account information ( Bitcoin wallet : bc1qxcpape4wtrndygq72eg40uuy7hzp4dnfh3vwfh ) Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I promise to delete all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all . My Father is in the hospital and I need this money . Please don't make me do this .

Ensure you complete the above mentioned transfer within 60 hours (2 days +). I will receive a notification right after you open this email , the countdown will start .

 If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public . Trust me , I am very careful , calculative and never make mistakes .

GOOD LUCK

Hi,

I work as IT Security Manager at the British Red Cross.

One of your staff members appears to have had their email account compromised and is sending malicious emails. We received one on Friday afternoon.

These have been sent from Nhyde@terringtonhall.com

Please investigate with your IT provider and resolve as a matter of urgency - as well as putting you as significant risk of ransomware this compromise is also a potential safeguarding issue.

Feel free to reach out if you need more info.


Thanks
Chris.

Dear St Paul's C of E Primary School

Your request has been updated with the following:

Hello,

Have you tried the application on an android devices instead of an ios devices ? would you be able to test the voice and video part of the application on an android devices and see if it works.
Also anther suggestion is to assign static addresses to these IOS devices via Vital, and passes these addresses to us to allow unfiltered connection to these devices that has this application installed on them.

There is little information on line to help in fixing this issue, but the one I have found and applied to the this case clearly didn't work with the school, also the logs on the filtering system doesn't show me anything.

Hi Karen

Thanks for your query.


It looks like you need to re-authorize your email authentication, please
take the following steps:

>Mgmnt Screen > Main menu > Library Setup > Campus Setup > Authorize OAUTH2
> Authorize



You should then see your Authorize box has turned from yellow to green.
If you click on Test you can send an email to yourself to see if it's
working.


I hope this helps. Please let me know how you get on!


Kind regards
Sarah

Good morning,

I am currently unable to send emails through the Accessit system. I receive
an error message as you can see in the photo below. Having spoken with our
IT people they have asked me to ask if we need a port to be opened and if
so which? We recently had IT issues at school and are slowly getting
systems back online so it may be that we have tightened down something that
is not allowing this to happen.

Any help would be appreciated.

Kind regards
Karen

As mentioned just earlier, these are the lessons which will have cover
this/next week where students may need assistance with passwords (if they
have not written them down):

Friday 24th March - P2 (10.30ish (after dismissals)) and P4 (13.00ish
(after dismissals))

Tuesday 28th March - P1 (9.10am) and P3 (11.30am).

Wednesday 29th March - P1 (9.10am) and P2 (10.30ish (after dismissals))

Thursday 30th March - P2 (10.30ish) and P4 (13.00ish (after dismissals))

If you are able to assist in any of these that would be greatly
appreciated! If the students could be reminded to write them down that
would be really helpful to.

Thanks in advance

Claire,



See attached email.  The email itself wasn’t from nhyde, but the link in it was to their personal OneNote in your Microsoft 365 domain, https://terringtonhallschool-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/nhyde_terringtonhall_com/EoMncqv2NLxEhxR3bTG2qdwBuvF5OujAjR8HkLdMRmI0iA?e=VRnFXx



I would recommend resetting that individual’s password, checking any emails sent out from that account and any email forwarding rules setup.



Cheers,



Richard

I have resent the initial admin invite to vkeel@ahs.pmat.academy, we
recommend registering with a generic school email addresses if possible,
this is because it means the school will not need to change their initial
admin when a staff member leaves. Once the initial admin has registered
(Through an external provider account Microsoft/Google etc.) and has signed
in they will be able invite additional staff members as an admin.
The site has not synced in 2 years so any new users in this time will not
have pulled through. I have provided some steps to follow below to
hopefully restart the sync: - Open SIMS Services Manager on the SIMS
server. - From the home page, locate the 'SIMS Online Services Client'
package and go into the settings for this package via the 'Actions' column.
- In the Client ID/Secret box, please remove the Client ID and Secret
details and re-add them with what is displayed below (Even if they look the
same): Client ID: ssm-c814f666-2a53-4d2c-bdf2-9152fe4b61c5 Secret:
j7goW8KUfMQEpo7A0lBoUxvkbfUDcFgR - Go back to the SSM homepage and toggle
the SIMS Online Service client package off and then on again. If users are
still not pulling through as expected please let me know. I have attached
the Options Online PDFs to the case. Kind regards,
Josh

come back to Graham after a number of years. I'm guessing his login is on a

Charlotte Johnson has now stepped down from the governing body - please can
her school Google account (cjohnson.governor@fishergateschool.com) be
removed/disabled?

I spotted Helen Thomas (hthomas.governor@) who stepped down a while ago
still appears to be in the Directory - can you check that her governor
Google account is disabled please?

I believe that the all.governor group should then consist of the following:

   - Mrs Jacqueline Hudson (jhudson.governor@)
   - Mr Graham Whitmore  (gwhitmore.governor@)
   - Ms Francesca Moxon  (fmoxon.governor@)
   - Dr Alisun Pawley  (apawley.governor@)
   - Ms Tamsin Tinkler  (ttinkler.governor@)
   - Mr Bill Twist  (btwist.governor@)

plus the chair.governor account, and then the following two people who are
also in the all.staff group!
Mrs Christina Clarke - headteacher@
Mrs Andrea Walton andrea.walton@

,T20230322.0206,Check students email  - ideally today if possible,"Hi James

I need to know if a student is correct in this claim below:

Apparently he opened Outlook to check emails as something popped up. As he opened it, there was group chat active with a recent comment made by another student with a link directing people to Word- he clicked this and it apparently said
""Search Beluga whale, it looks like (female student)""

Would you be able to have a look in Harrison Frear's email and see if you can see the email etc, and do me some screen shots of this email or chat?

I have given a C3 for writing the document and looking for a link to share it, but the above is the students recount of the events. Need to know whether to remove the C3 for tomorrow.

Thanks
Sarah

Major Microsoft Outlook Security Threat!



A new very serious critical vulnerability/zero-day threat that impacts
Microsoft Outlook has been detected. Unlike other exploits we’ve seen in
the past, this exploit is particularly dangerous because *no user
interaction is required* to trigger the exploit. Once an infected email
arrives in a Microsoft Outlook inbox, your sensitive credential hashes can
be obtained by the cybercriminal. The email does not have to be viewed for
the exploitation to be processed.


Microsoft have now released a patch to remedy the vulnerability, so we
recommend *immediately* patching to protect yourself and your network from
this dangerous exploit. All supported versions of Microsoft Outlook for
Windows are impacted to include the locally installed Outlook from MS365.
Other versions of Microsoft Outlook such as Android, iOS, Mac as well as
Outlook on the web and other M365 services on the web are not affected.


Any customers using Hornet or Mimecast are currently protected as the
infected email is removed, but we still recommend that all machines are
fully patched.


In the meantime, we are checking and applying any recommended mitigations
we can to stop the exploit. But the best course of action is to patch all
Windows Computers.


If you need any help, please contact our helpdesk at
support@practicalnetworks.co.uk <mailto:support@practicalnetworks.co.uk> or

Hi Sarah,
I mentioned this to Tom Paley a while ago and he said he'd contact you about it as thought it was a good idea.
Is it possible to have apps on the desktop of each computer so we can easily access the following:

  *   School Calendar
  *   Wisepay
  *   parents eve school cloud.

I know I'm not the only member of staff who spends too much time searching for these, having to reset passwords etc...

Kind regards

,T20230322.0017,Laptops,"From ""Smith, Ms C"" <smith.c@sfx.npcat.org.uk>: Hi

I'm not sure if it's you or Marina I go to for this: please could I book 1
laptop for period 5 today? One pupil has to finish the mock exam and
refuses to do it on chrome book because it's a different format. I hoped on
Monday that she'd just pick one up but couldn't find one anywhere so I
thought best to book it to avoid her flapping.

Thanks
Claire

Ms Hopson asked me to email you as I am having issues accessing Microsoft apps such as word and PowerPoint on. My personal iMac desktop at home. Upon opening word and PowerPoint, I receive a message at the top of the screen saying “your account 17stokjo@huntington-ed.org.uk<mailto:17stokjo@huntington-ed.org.uk> doesn’t allow editing on a Mac. To learn more, contact your admin about your office plan” and I am unable to type or do anything to any documents new or old. I have used iMacs and MacBook’s to do school work from home for the last few years and have never encountered an issue before. Is there anything that can be done to resolve this.
Many thanks Josh.S

having realised I have been putting this in the wrong support box.
Can we have the printer in G1 linked to all the computers in G1 / have the
computers link up to the other printers in the academy as well.
There are one or two that are connected, but the bulk are not.
As we teach GCSE Photography to Y11 and Y10 - It is really important that
the students have access to, and can print off their work.
Y11 especially need this to happen in the run up to the exams.

The laptop I was loaned by school is feeling very sad.  Would you be able
to 'reset' it/take a look to see if we can make it any happier?  It won't
connect to the wifi at home and is running really slowly.

Would it be possible to find out which email address the school calendar is
attached to?  It's called Office Calendar I believe and is the main
calendar for events across the school.  I'm fairly new to Burton Green and
I haven't been able to locate this calendar yet, but I will be responsible
for updating it.  Our Headteacher and some teachers have access to it, but
they cannot share access with me.  We think it might have been created by
my predecessor, Karen Heywood.  Is there any way to check this please?

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.

Unfortunately I have no short term solution for you. We are currently in
the process of a whole school IT upgrade with Sixth Form next on the list
but the business classrooms will make the summer programme.

We will get there but not this term i'm afraid.

I'm using the same email and password that I use for the G drive.

Not sure whether it's a settings issue.

8 tables with 2 chairs at each one plus a table for the administrator.
They will also need 2 crash mats.
Kevin - they will need access to the school wifi please.
Year 9 team - I will put something in the bulletin for staff. We have made

,T20230321.0077,"Connection to printer sorted yesterday, is now lost. Cannot reconnect.","Morning
Yesterday Holly kindly remote accessed my laptop when I was at Woodthorpe,
to link me to the printer in the Trust office called:SharpPrinters on
SB-APPS01

Alas, when I have tried to print today, it is not coming up in the printer
option drop down from the document.

When I then tried to go into settings and re-add the printer, it was
visible, but then this error message came up when I tried to Add it.

I assume when I do get this sorted, setting to Default may 'keep it' in the
document drop down menus?

Thanks
Andrew

Good afternoon,

Tobys chrome book screen has been smashed and on research, if I’m correct in thinking,  if I brought the chrome book in this can be passed to Vital to fix and then we get billed for this and pay accordingly.

Please can you confirm if this is something I can do?

He needs his chrome book for his school work and I’m having to try get lap tops from work to bring home on a weekend for his to do it and I don’t want him to get behind or miss something.

Many thanks

Sorry to be a pain - but is there any chance you can come and look at the
chromebooks in 306 as some students are not able to to sign in or access
their GC classroom accounts etc? We need these up and running asap as

Strictly private and confidential.

I received an email from d.barber@ebor.academy on the 31st January 2023 and
moved it to the Bin. As 30 days have passed I cannot recover it myself but

As the email in question falls within this time period I would like to
request the email is recovered for me.

The email email subject is:  Alderman Cogan SBP
Email sent: d.barber@ebor.academy
Recipient email: p.scott@ebor.academy

The content of the email is a replied to message of just a single line.

I am away from the office at the moment so please can you communicate with

Hi Laurence
Thanks for your help.
I have same issue with the Millthorpe remote desktop.
Stuart was thinking it might be that Woodthorpe's firewall might be
preventlng, and he was going to discuss with Vital.

Anyway, I'll leave that with you.
I've just tried with Edge, and it still tries and tries, then gives this
error message.

Any help appreciated,

Good news 🙂 I have been able to get Now V working on my own laptop.

I'm going to bring it in tomorrow and it should work - the only thing i'll need is to be able to access the wifi and to make sure it doesn't get blocked.

Please could you let me know how I access the school wifi at some point tomorrow - I don't teach the class until p4 so will be setting it up over lunch.

Fingers crossed it will work. If it doesn't work I have written down what I did to get it to work so can try that on the school computer as well.

Thanks loads for all your help.

Subject: Ongoing RDS issues

Hi Stuart,

Sorry to email at the weekend. I’m still having problems with RDS – I emailed Vital directly, and they told me that you’d been in touch with Dan about it, and that I should speak to you.

The problem is slightly different from last time – when I try to connect, instead of just timing out, it’s giving me the following message:

Oops, we couldn't connect to ""Staff RDS""
Your session ended because an unexpected server authentication certificate was received from the remote PC. Ask your admin or tech support for help.

Any tips?

,T20230317.0130,St Georges School Scarborough,"From Mark Jervis <mjervis@spectrum.tech>: Hi

We look after the copier at the above school and it's stopped talking on our eMaintenance system.  This means the customer won't get their toner automatically and we are unable to monitor the copier for parts life etc.

I've spoken to them today and obtained the error code it's returning.  It points to either Proxy settings being absent or incorrect, DNS incorrect, gateway, or firewall blocking it.

I've attached a pdf detailing fault finding and what needs to be in place for this to work correctly.

If you could check the firewall side of things from your side and let us know the correct settings for
Gateway
DNS
Proxy (if used or not and details if used)


We'd be happy to work with you if needed and will happily do a Teamviewer session to have a look into it with you, as it's important to the customer to have this working.

Subject: Confirmation of Acceptance to Connect the Classroom Programme: Procurement Pack Attached CRM:0465418

In regards to: Woodlesford Primary School 

Dear  Jackie Batley,


Regarding your recent application for Connect the Classroom funding, we are pleased to confirm that following a review of the information you submitted regarding your ICT infrastructure in school, we will be able to support you in carrying out upgrades. Based on the information supplied, our suggested schedule of items to be funded is as follows:

  *   Core Network Switches
  *   Edge Switches with Power Over Ethernet and MultiGig capability to connect these to your network
  *   Wireless Access Points
  *   This is in addition to the installation and handover of that equipment

Please note, there are a number of reasons why what you finally need might differ from the above.

The solution presented to DfE should be for campus-wide WiFi coverage and as such quantities may differ to what you currently have installed.

We attach a procurement pack for you school containing several attachments.

What to do next

  *   Before proceeding further, we recommend that you speak with your ICT Support provider about the scope of work in your setting.
  *   You will need to issue copies of the attached Procurement Pack to your potential suppliers.
  *   Once you have a quotation that you are ready to proceed with, please return the completed Document 3 Cost Matrix to us along with all supporting documentation from your chosen supplier. Return all documents to the mailbox address along with your URN in the subject line.
  *   Do not raise a Purchase Order or confirm works until we issue you with authorisation to proceed. Your grant payment is only guaranteed after you have received a funding approval letter from us.

Help?

  *   Webinars are running to go through the above, step by step, with the opportunity to ask questions. You will find a link to join them in the instructions or contact us for an invitation.
  *   If you need any advice, contact us at: ConnectTheClassroom.DfEICT@education.gov.uk<mailto:ConnectTheClassroom.DfEICT@education.gov.uk>
  *   If you need assistance in finding suitable suppliers, please contact us. We are unable to recommend specific suppliers to you but can direct you to places where you can find potential ones.
  *   If a supplier has a question about the requirements, you can direct them to us for clarification. Please ask them to include your URN ( 107834 ) in the subject line of any email they send to us so that we know which school they are asking about. There are also webinars for suppliers and a link is included in their instructions document in the pack.

Just checking in to see about p5 today.

I've also realised that I'm teaching it in po3 not po2 but I have said that if it works on the computer in po2 I'll just swap the computers over, otherwise we'll have to install it etc on the one in po3.

Really sorry for all the extra work this is causing you.

Thanks
Ruth

I was only informed of the issue yesterday.

I have set the student's password to RedFolder67!

This is set to not change and will be both the network logon and the
Google/Classroom login.

Let me know if you have any issues.

Many thanks

Would it be possible for me to have access to Mark's googlemail? He often
has documents shared with him and asks me to share them further or compile
tham in some way. At the moment I have to request access from the original
sharer which is not always timely.

Mark mentioned that his previous exec assistant was able to do this and
when people shared information with him they were informed it would also be
shared with the exec.

Hope that makes sense.

Thanks :-)

Good evening,

I have tried to log into the full version of the remote using the
yorkhighschool\v.bettney structure

I get this message -
[image: image.png]

I say yes, and then it just constantly says 'loading the virtual machine'.
I've tried numerous times and have redownloaded the link a couple of times.

I tried it at work on Wednesday (downloading the full client version) and
it worked

Many thanks,

Vicky

Dear St Paul's C of E Primary School

Your request has been updated with the following:

Hello School,

Sorry about the delay, I have been trying to find a solution for this one, I have added the url:translate.google.co.uk to the school allowed category and also created HTTPS do not inspection policy for Translation on the filtering system.

Can you try again and see if the application works this time, also if it doesn't work, is this application is only going to be used on one device, because if that is the case, we can allow this device unfiltered connection through the smoothwall, as they are some applications that just do not work when a proxy of any kind is in the way. Please test again and let me know, also tel me about the time you have done your test and the IP address of your device you are doing the test from so I can look at the logs and see if any thing is been blocked.

Kind regards,

I think I have worked out why NOW TV won't work on the school computer (having tried all day  to get it to work on my computer at home). Basically you need to have the Now TV app not web browser and you can't get the app (as far as I can tell) on windows. So am I right in thinking that this will be the same for all the computers in school?

I have got the app on my phone and can play the show on my phone but then I have no way of projecting this.

Is there anything you can do to help with this? Does the school have any other computers or devices that would be able to run the app (on my phone I just downloaded it form the google play store).

Unfortunately because the students had already started to learn about this production for their exam then we have to continue with it but they have to be able to watch it and re watch sections of it and as far as I know Now TV is the only site that is streaming this particular production.

Anyway, I am teaching the students period 5 today and I really need to be able to show the production so if there is anything you can do to help this would be greatly appreciated.

Big Thanks
Ruth

,T20230316.0205,Technological Resources,"Good evening,

As part of our curriculum, it is really beneficial for our EYFS children to
be exposed to a range of different technological resources that they can
tinker with. However, as a school, we do not have many of these resources.
Would you have any old technological resources like these anywhere that our
children would be able to use? The most useful things would be a selection
of disconnected computer hardware: mice, keyboards, motherboards, USB
sticks, system fans, hard drives, monitors, computer towers etc. I am not
sure if this is something that you would be able to help with.

Many thanks,
Lauren

After a conversation with Amouska, she has asked me to email this request.

Before the cyber attack, the reception computer used to be signed on with a
Reception account rather than, for example k.tomlinson.

The new set up has me signing in myself (as k.tomlinson) which is OK until
I am not here for whatever reason.

Anouska has asked for the following people to be given the same access to
reception items as I have so, if they have to log in on the reception
computer to cover me, they can access the same things as I can, for
example, hello@ email, Entrysign, PrintSvcV5, etc:

Karen Bramhill
Jane Wright
Angela King
Kathi Gooding

In addition, in the event I was absent longer term and supply was needed to
cover me, Anouska has asked if a Supply Reception account could be set up
so they could log on to the computer in reception and have access to the
same things.

Many Thanks
Karen

 Hello,

Quick question: Is there a printing ban in the morning? I have noticed that
I cannot find the printers before lunch (Below the screenshot of what I see
now. I am not able to send any doc to the printer):

[image: image.png]

In the afternoon, I am able to select the printer without making any
changes to my settings. I am probably missing something.  Any help would be
appreciated.

Thank you!

Hi

To try and cut back on unclaimed printing we have turned on printer codes for year 12 and 13. They can still print as they need but like staff they will need to put in a code to release the printing. They should all have a code in their school emails if they search for papercut.
If they need new code they can contact James by email and he can sort that out for them:  huntingtonitsupport@vitalyork.com<mailto:huntingtonitsupport@vitalyork.com> . I didn't know if it would be worth sharing on the bulletin?  James has help some students using the library printer already but those who rarely print may not know.

Thank you!
Sarah

,T20230315.0249,6th form printing,"Hi

To try and cut back on unclaimed printing we have turned on printer codes for year 12 and 13. They can still print as they need but like staff they will need to put in a code to release the printing. They should all have a code in their school emails if they search for papercut.
If they need new code they can contact James by email and he can sort that out for them:  huntingtonitsupport@vitalyork.com<mailto:huntingtonitsupport@vitalyork.com> . I didn't know if it would be worth sharing on the bulletin?  James has help some students using the library printer already but those who rarely print may not know.

I've sent her the link which I use when I work from home, so please be careful because my link works perfectly well when I work from home 🙂

Hi Sarah,

I hope you are well.

I have a few different things to which may resolve the issue.

Firstly try clearing the web browser's cache and disabling any plugins/add-ons all of the affected computers - If this fails try another browser - Please consult your IT/Tech team with help of the prior.

If this does not help please let me know and I will investigate further.

Hi
We have an intermittent issue with registers in some rooms.

In most rooms the history for pupil attendance is available and if not the tick box is available to turn it on.

However, in a hand full of rooms in the school it is not, the registers look like this:

[https://eucattachment.freshdesk.com/inline/attachment?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6MzAxMDExNjE5MTYwNiwiZG9tYWluIjoidGVzZ2xvYmFsLmZyZXNoZGVzay5jb20iLCJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoxMDMyNzU4fQ.qNtgv3HLcFupLk_nLNBAojZ-vvxYmq13g6XmGqtzlVs]

This is a real challenge as we need to flag pupils who are in school but missing from lessons, without the history we cannot see this.

Can you advise on what the issue is and how we might fix this?

Thanks

Our school is going to be starting to use Insight to record our data. Currently emails are not arriving and I have spoken to technical support who have suggested it may be something to do with the network.
They have suggested that I send the information below to you.
Many thanks

Insight is a web-based application. Your network must allow access to the following domain names:

insighttracking.com

d3nvj2okxqsvs0.cloudfront.net

userflow.com

Sometimes school networks block domain names, which prevents Insight from working.

If Insight is failing to load, then please ask your IT or network administrator to check if the above domain names need to be unblocked. Also check that any sub-domains of them are permitted e.g. *.userflow.com

Hi there,
I wondered if you could cost me for a new charging lead for our chrome book trolley, one got caught in the door and now has exposed wires so makes that lead unusable - I spoke to Russ earlier and he asked me what the chrome books were, but all I can find is that they are HP ones, but don't know where to find the rest of the information
Can you let me know where to find this information if you still need it
Many thanks

Also I have noticed in Bromcom it hasn't written back any @staugs email

I have attached a screenshot of a message that has just started to appear
on my screen each morning when I switch my PC on.

I did notice that on Monday I couldn't print on the reception printer even
though it did give me the option to select it.  At the same time I could
print on Xerox but the confirmation box did not appear at all.

This has all sorted itself out now and I can print to both printers and the
confirmation box has reappeared, but I wanted to let you know about the

,T20230315.0039,Update Chrome Netsweeper agent.,"Talk straight made a change so we could use Twitter, the change was to flag
the agent to only work on device-specific OS.

The knock-on effect of this was that the Mac suite started to have issues
with previously unblocked websites.

Talk straight has suggested the following

Dear Kevin,

I have removed the setting,* I think the next course of action is to
upgrade the Chrome agent that is being deployed for the school from 3.17 to
the 4.20* however it is a toal change to the method and you would need to

A staff member in Year 2 has been in touch to say that the cables in her
class are no longer working (please see her message below). Are we able to
get replacements direct from yourselves or do we need to order these?



*There is a problem with both of the cables that connect my laptop to my
IWB (both the one that plugs into the USB and the one that goes in the
HDMI). It means that I can't move my laptop at all and the smallest
movement or knock means that everything disconnects. Even when everything
is plugged in, it leads to a problem with the sound, maybe as the HDMI
cable is cracked open too so that you can see inside.*

Thanks,
Luke

I notice your name is on a classroom headed Chromebook support, so thought
you might be able to help. This request is a bit late (especially if you’re
striking!), but if we were able to borrow a Chromebook for the strike day
on Thursday, that would be handy, as we only have one laptop between the
two boys. Oscar’s brother Edwin is in school tomorrow as he’s in Year 7
(7ASu) if there was one that you could send home with him.
Thank you.

In trying to ensure that the music IT provision will meet you need we will
also know what additional kit you will be plugging into the laptops.
It is very unusual that schools teach music on laptops and we need to
ensure they have the ports on them to connect with any keyboards or other
accessories that you use.
In terms of video editing, this is not software we have previously required
in music so I don't think we have anything available without additional
cost.

Just before we make the purchase can I ask if the laptop route is the only
option going forward?  With all the software and potential port
requirements it would make a lot more sense to use an IT suite or create a
fixed music suite?

Hi Rachel,

Tom Arundell asked in lesson today what the arrangements would be for
having a laptop in the Music exam - he needs it for last section of the
exam.  Do I need to arrange this with it being in the drama studio and not
the sports hall?  Apparently he didn't have one for his last Music mock so
just want to make sure it's sorted for him.

Thanks,
Chris

,T20230314.0140,Fwd: Welcome Archbishop Holgates School (8164500) to SIMS Online Services,"Hi Kevin/Alexis,
We need this completed to enable access to Options Online....but you can
still use Options directly through SIMS without, I believe (with the
mystery password, of course!).
We don't use Parent Lite at the moment, but it is free with our
package, and perhaps worth a look? (It's like class charts)

This will require the SIMS update I requested earlier in the week, doing
before we can complete the process.

Is everyone happy for us to proceed with this registration?

Frequently Asked Questions

Where can I find out more about how to perform the installation?

Installation instructions for SIMS Options Online can be downloaded here
<https://myaccount.capita-cs.co.uk/Search/DownloadDocument?s=ResourceID-1-5660>.

Installation instructions for SIMS Parent Lite can be downloaded here
<http://simspublications.com/876223/assets/simsparentinstall.pdf>.

The instructions provide step-by-step details for the installation of this
service. We strongly recommend that they are forwarded onto your school IT
contact.

Do I have to perform the installation all in one go?

No, you can stop and start the installation again at any time. If you have
already registered you can go straight back to the admin portal
<https://admin.sims.co.uk/> with the account you used to register with us
originally.

What if I opted in for a remote installation and overview by ESS?

For schools who have opted in for a remote install and overview, please
await contact from a member of our Professional Services team for next
steps.

What if I am a Hosted SIMS school?

For Hosted SIMS schools, please begin the installation process as described
in the documentation and log a case with the service desk when you are
ready for the technical installation to take place.

I have a SIMS ID username/password from another product. Can I use this?

We don't currently support using existing SIMS ID username/passwords for
system onboarding. Please use another supported account type, such as
Office 365 or Google.

Who should I contact for support?

If you have any questions about the installation process or are not sure
about something, please log a support case with your support unit.

case regarding the black ink. I urgently need this cartridge on Tuesday
morning and assurances that this will not happen again.

Sorry I haven’t got our serial number, I am at home now so do not know it.

Please reply to this urgently.

Many thanks
Tracey

I am emailing from Howitt Primary Community School regarding ongoing issues that I have with uploading documents to my Single Central Record.  Previously you have connected remotely and the issue with the filtering at the school had been resolved.  It does let me get as far as picking the document up for uploading and I can see it trying to upload but doesn't.  I hope this makes sense.

Kind regards

Subject: Home Access issues over the weekend

Hi Sarah

I was unable to access any resources . email over the weekend  - it came up with a message that the security certificate had expired and connections were unsafe. I could eventually log on but there were no icons to click to access anything.

Will this be rectified as I am not in school on Tuesdays but need to be able to access the system for Y13 reports for example?

Thanks

Louise

I have my form in C10 so only use the computer to complete the register or display a powerpoint for M3. Every now and then I keep getting a message saying that certain things won't open unless I free up some disk space. I don't have this issue on any other PC. This morning it won't let me open teams because it says I need to free up some space first. It's not essential for me to get onto teams this morning but I will need to get on there during form at some point because I have the progress spreadsheet to fill in. I'm not sure if it's an issue with me or just generally the PC but I haven't seen this message pop up on any other computers and I am in B08 for most of the week.

Thank you,

Amy

Hi Jo,

Please could you offer some help when you are able to - I think the HDMI
cable (I think that's what it is called) has always been a little
temperamental in nursery and the connection between the whiteboard and
laptop drops if the cable is knocked.

Kirsty has now said that this afternoon the board was completely unable to
connect to the laptop.

Please could we see if this needs a new lead or maybe something else?

Thanks for your help.

Can you please give me a date when Ruby May Chappell's Surface Pro has been
fully configured and this has been made available to Ruby? She has been
waiting quite a while now and while I know this is a complicated problem,
it is vital we don't delay too much further.

When the device is ready, I have agreed with Ruby that this will be held by
me and she will pick it up each morning and then drop it back with me each
end of day, so please pass the fully working device to me when you have it
done.

Thanks

,T20230311.0026,Remote access,"Hi,

Sorry to email at the weekend - I'm trying to access the school network remotely in order to mark some work on the school's server, and am trying to access the following address:

https://terringtonhallrds.vitalcloud.co.uk/RDWeb/webclient/

When I try to go to this address, I get a message (NET::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID) telling me that the security certificate has expired. It will allow me to access it if I click through 'Advanced' and then 'continue (unsafe)', but I'm getting lots of warnings that what I am doing is very dangerous. Could the certificate be updated?

Thanks,

wonder if this has been caused by the recent Remote Desktop change (not
that either myself or Heather are on the RD), or perhaps it's a

be appreciated.

We issued a student laptop to Kaylum Preston (y11) who is working from
home. Tom helped get this ready.

They’ve had quite a few problems

Firstly the tutor cannot organise meeting him virtually via this because
Kaylum isn’t able to access Teams or Zoom via it - is this a restriction on
student accounts? Can it be adjusted in this case?

Secondly they’ve managed to lock themselves out, presumably by trying the
wrong password a few times. Could it be unlocked / reset?

We’ve had quite a few delays getting this out to him so if we can get this
sorted, it would be appreciated.

We have noticed that the system is not syncing to SIMS, therefore new

this and they need to remote in. As we have had issues they would like
Vital to contact them to advise whether they can remote in.

I have a thumb drive with me  that has all of the Drama exam recordings on for the GCSE exam that took place on Tues.

I am teaching this afternoon in po2 but do bob in to see me if you are free.

Please see message below from Clare Smith (class 10) in regards to her

Hello,

I hope you are well, I'm afraid it's the same laptop and problem again...
When at home, the laptop is not linking to the printers in school and It
won't let me download anything. In school this isn't a problem.

Is there a list of instructions they could send me to enable the laptop to
do these 2 things as it happens so often.

,T20230309.0110,Cyber security response plan - help needed!,"Hi,

I'm trying to complete a cyber security response plan from a template that
NYCC have shared with us, and need your help on a couple of sections please:

Am I right that it's only yourselves you have Admin access to the server?
No-one in school does that I'm aware of.

I also need to provide the back-up type and frequency for the server and G
drive.  I know the on-site back for the server is daily, how frequent is
the off-site/immutable back up?

What are the back up arrangements for G drive - if there are any?  And if
none, is there anything else I can say about why not?

If there's any chance of getting back to me by tomorrow that would be
hugely appreciated.

Many thanks,
Carrie

Please would it be possible to arrange for two Chromebooks for Monday P4
each week?

This is as we have two students who will be working in a non-IT room until
Easter and so will be unable to access the Google Classroom to complete the
work without these.

I can collect them and bring them back at the end of the day, or can just
keep until Easter if we have 2 to spare until then.

The speakers in S19 have been a bit dodge for a while, but they are getting
worse.  The feedback and buzzing when you watch clips etc is awful.
It practically drowns the real sound.
I was told a few years ago that one of the speakers was broken but I
couldn’t have a new pair until they both broke.  Not sure if this is still
the case?

,T20230308.0155,Google Sharing problems,"Hello Kevin

Thanks for the quick chat at lunchtime - here is the problem - in detail!
If you are able to escalate this at Vital to someone who may know both our
systems and Southbank MAT that would be great.

We are having increasing problems with staff from some Southbank MAT
schools being unable to access items on our Google Drive - specifically at
Scarcroft and Knavesmire Primary.  We first became aware of it a few months
ago when it was just the Teaching School Hub logo that wouldn't send which
wasn't a massive issue.  However, more staff are struggling to access
shared areas and documents which they need for the training programmes.
Matt Oxley at Scarcroft contacted Vital but was told it was down to
Pathfinder sharing settings, I really can't see how it could be.  Matt is
part of a cohort of schools from various MATs and it's only Scarcroft that
can't access the materials, and I get the pop up below when I try to send
emails.  These are not individual emails, they are sent to the whole group
at once with a link to the shared folder/document. Eleanor Gilligan
(Knavesmire) is on a different training course and needs access to
documents but again I receive a pop-up when I try to send her anything with
a link.

To confirm, we are not experiencing this problem with any other schools
across York, Ryedale or Scarborough, just these two in the Southbank MAT.
Plus the other Southbank schools (York High, Millthorpe, Woodthorpe Primary
& Carr Junior) appear to be fine.

Following on from the L40 mac computer (number 1) that hard drive filled
up, it seems they are all heading the same way. Number 2 is already saying
the hard drive is nearly full.

When I looked it said 190GB is system data. I have not looked at all of
them but the ones I have are getting full  and seems to be system data
causing the problem

Think this need looking at urgently or they all are going to stop working

I am just emailing for an update on 102.

There are three PCs missing (which were taken out a few months ago for
repair as they would not turn on).

I just wondered when these would be brought back?

In addition, do we have an expected date for the 5 class Chromebook's to be
returned which were kept in this classroom? Some classes have more students
than PCs and so we were using these but after the network issue had to hand
these back in for staff.

Thanks

,T20230308.0083,Tracking Parent communication,"Hi Kevin,
Would it be possible to create/link an 'Parent' style email account to each
year group.

*The Aim:*

   - enable reception (& other) staff to view any/all electronic
   correspondence that has been sent out from school.
   - test communications before they are sent to all parents.
   - enable preemptive questions to be asked, ahead of parents calling in
   (forewarned, is forearmed).
   - know what parents are referring to when they call in.


*The Problem:*
Currently, unless we have a parent member of staff willing to share their
personal communications received, we have no idea what parents are talking
about when they ring in.

*The Dream:*
Ideally we would love something like a google classroom for each year
groups, with messages and letters allocated and stored in each/all with the
latest at the top. Easy to access and view for multiple users.

Have you any ideas or suggestions that would work better than this? eg:
link the reception email to each year group? Not sure how, as we
can't create a fake student in each year, as this would cause Census chaos!!
The Audit Trail in IRIS Reach is currently far too complicated to access
quickly even if it wasn't  too slow to be useful.

Could you ask Giles what other schools do?

I don't quite know where to go from here.

28th March we want to show a movie in the theatre as a reward for students.
Finance are saying no one can have access to the amazon account details
(Which is logical), however this means we can not stream the video, they
have suggested a DVD, however, I believe the school laptops no longer have
a DVD player built in? Streaming also meant the purchase was there forever,
it couldn't be lost or damaged.

Do either of you have any suggestions?

Hi Sue

We are not allowed to share the log in details with staff unfortunately, so
this would not be possible.
Is a DVD purchase an option instead perhaps?  It appears to be £2.33 on
Amazon currently (link below)
https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beautiful-Mind-DVD-Russell-Crowe/dp/B0001E5TK6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=23H2V99VQ1WVT&keywords=a+beautiful+mind+dvd&qid=1678268429&s=instant-video&sprefix=a+beautiful+mind+dvd%2Cinstant-video%2C66&sr=1-1-catcorr

OR do you have a personal Amazon account that you could perhaps use and
then claim the costs back via Edupay (prior approval from Sarah would be
required).

Hi Nikki.
Are we still logging any IT issues with you?
If so, my problem is that I can't print at all from my laptop at the

no response at all.

The cables in S6 behind the teacher desk are constantly coming out.
I know this has been looked at before but one of them is down to the wire
in socket 2/019 and I am not sure how safe it is.

I know the PC in S6 has not been done yet and I have asked for the teacher
desk to be moved forward as much as possible so could these things be
looked at together as part of the issue is how far the desk is back.
The configuration of the desk is such a way for my RSI but it really needs
to be much further forward into the room.

Happy to move stuff off the desk etc to make it easier to do, if you let me
know when you want to do it along with the PC.

I am not in any rush

Thanks

Configuration
To: swillsden@ahs.pmat.academy <swillsden@ahs.pmat.academy>
Cc: Kate Jackson <Kate.Jackson@cla.co.uk>


Dear Sam,



I write with reference to the recent data collection briefing with my
colleague Kate Jackson and understand that the school wishes to utilise the
CLA Copy button in  PaperCut MF during the exercise.  As the data
collection starts early next term, it’s important that the CLA Copy button
is installed at the earliest opportunity and certainly before the end of
this term, so we can ensure everything is working as it should.  The button
is a great way to send us your data so below are the set-up essentials
needed to get the ball rolling:



*Installing and configuring the button*

The CLA Copy button works in MF version 21.0 or later and, if running site
servers, 22.0 or later.  We recommend you check with your PaperCut provider
if there are any questions as to the MF status at the school. Once a
version check has been done, the CLA connector should be installed on the
same server as PaperCut MF.  The instructions for this can be found in the
document *CLA-PaperCut* *Integration Guide*, attached to this email.



An important part of the integration is to include the three pieces of
unique identifying information which we provide.  This allows CLA to
understand where the data has come from and ensure a secure end to end
transfer process.  Page 3 of the Integration Guide shows where these
details are required, with the specifics for your school provided on the
attached document, *Unique ID Details.*  It is important that only
CLA-provided details are entered in these three fields otherwise the data
will not reach our Azure data lake correctly and the installation will need
to be reconfigured.



*Test Scan *

Once you have completed the installation, the next step is to send us a
test scan using the CLA Copy button.  Once this scan has been sent please
drop me a short email confirming as such, including the date and time it
was sent.  Once successfully received I will confirm and, if there are any
issues which require further intervention, I will advise on next steps.



If you have any questions about any of the above, please do get in touch by
email or phone.  We will always endeavour to assist with the more common
issues we come across though there are occasions when we may need to
involve your PaperCut provider.  I will let you know if that is the case.



You now have all the essentials for setting up the CLA Copy button so thank
you for helping us to support the rights holders and I look forward to
hearing from you.







*Best wishes*

My Smartnotebook keeps shutting itself down. It doesn't come up with an
error message or crash, it just disappears, usually when it is in the
background rather than directly working on it. I have lost work this way as
it does not save it.

Hello,



Leigh Farrow has asked me to get in touch about installing a phone for you now that the cabling has been fixed at Westfield. Do you have a phone on site that I can install or do you need a replacement? I am free tomorrow or Thursday so please let me know a time if either of these days work for you.

Now that we have all the laptops back, can the printers please be
relabelled to the rooms that they are located. Giles did say that this
could be done, to make life easier for all.

This will help staff to find the printer for the correct room, At present
when you have to add a printer through the manage button, the printers are
just codes and names and it is all guesswork. This is time consuming for
staff.

Thanks

I have reported an issue with my desktop before - it is running
excruciatingly slowly. To the point where it is affecting my productivity.

When it was looked at, I was told it was very old.

Could I ask what the procedure is for replacing it please? How much this
would cost and if there are already in place to replace the old units and
what the timescales are?

There is a service tag on the PC - is this useful? G3Z56K2

Please could you confirm when Marcel will be visiting. Once again I have a laptop not working so it needs a health check-up.

I also have 5 laptops that are no longer being used as broken, please can they be collected and securely disposed off and you send me a receipt to say as such.

Hi there,

Thanks for your email. The email we have pulled from the MIS for Kelly is
k.jessup@gra.hlt.academy so this is the account that is syncing her
classes. If she would like her other email k.sissons@gra.hlt.academy to be
synced the email will need to be attached to her profile on the MIS so we
can pull it through on the sync.

For any queries or questions related to the sync with Seneca, feel free to
contact me directly at learnmore@seneca.io.

All the best,

Dear Ms Bedford,

Thank you for your email.

I am writing to confirm our virtual meeting on Tuesday 7th March 2023 at 12
o’clock to discuss the forthcoming collection of royalties data which will
take place between 24th April to 11th July 2023.  These dates are fixed in
order to ensure a robust sample.

During the meeting, discussions will focus on preparing for the exercise,
how we capture data, communications and support materials.  Given there
will be no on-site visits we will need to ensure staff are aware of their
role and obligations during the exercise.  I will also be demonstrating our
intuitive online data tool, My Content.

I anticipate we will need no more than 30 minutes and, of course, I will be
more than happy to address any queries you and colleagues may have.

Could you please provide the following in advance of our meeting,

  *   Photocopier/MFD location details (I believe you have 2).
  *   The school’s most used subscription sites – e.g Twinkl
  *   A direct dial phone number in case of computer gremlins on the day!

Kind regards

Hi mate



Kelly’s PC doesn’t have any printers set up – are you OK to pop over and sort at some point as it’s quite important that she can print.



Also, can you let me know when you have updates about the printing from chromebooks so I can let Y10 tutors know.



Thanks

,T20230306.0277,New Ticket - 06/03/2023 17:18,"Hi Ben,

I need your help with an issue I am trying to solve.

I have a student in Year 11 who is recovering from a long illness and is
being tutored externally.  I have been asked to provide resources, namely
our complete schemes which are on our system.

The tutor has advised me to send as a zip file.

I have attempted this and tried to attach the zipped file, which was too
large and therefore needed to be sent a link to GoogleDrive.  However, then
I was informed this person would not have the necessary permissions to
access.

Is there a way to send one of our files to someone externally?

Any help you can provide here would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Adam

,T20230306.0166,Printing Issues new staff,"Hi All

Firstly a big thanks to the 2 ITT trainees for being so patient and helping
me test this issue.

It seems we have an issue where the machines are not recognising the cards
very well, especially with JMcbride.

Problem :

When users are swiping cards they are constantly being asked to manually
login EVERYTIME. This means that despite Papercut having the card
information stored the users are loosing time and also print jobs unless
they stay on one printer manufacturer.

Investigation :

I tested with 2 users across 4 machines.
Two users Jittmcbride/Jittprivett
Xerox - History office + Staff room.
Toshiba - Pathfinder + Tech corridor

Both these users were able to replicate the issue.

I`ll keep you all updated once I have further assistance from my Vital
colleagues as we may need to also reach out to the printer company.

Many Thanks

we had some issues this morning when several pupils were trying to submit a
google form
via the pupils ipads.They all just got an error when they submitted. They
must have had internet
to load the google form ok initially.

I had a look at one and it seemed to have got disconnected from the wifi. I
manually
reconnected it to SMCCAT-PSK and it seems ok now.

Could you check if all Access points are ok please? Could it be something
to do with jamf ?

thanks

Every time the computer is shut down or restarted after an update it just shows a black screen with DELL and a wheel going around.  You can't override it or turn it off, Lucy has to wait until the battery goes completely flat and then the computer will reconfigure and work again.  Could you please look into this.

I am computing lead at Woodthorpe Primary. In order to complete some of our
computing topics, our children need access to ScratchJr. They used to be
able to access this through google Chrome but now it requires them to
download it. Would this be possible to add to their Chromebooks?

Also, we have many units that require a stop motion animator app. I think
there is a free extension that can be added that the children can use.
Would this be possible too?

Many thanks,
Lauren

I've been told by colleagues that we are able to print again as long as we
have signed in with our new microsoft account. I have signed in but the
only option that comes up when I attempt to print anything is 'save as pdf'
or 'save to drive' and not the mono-print option that would allow me to
send it to a printer.

Any advice much appreciated,

I wonder if you can help?
I have been teaching my class about the different parts of a computer and
what they do ( motherboard, graphics card etc). My class are quite able.
I have sources some old, broken PCs and we want to take them apart. Having
googled, it, there seems to be lots of risks and dangers in doing this?
Would anyone from Vital be able to either:

   - look at the PCs to see if they would be dangerous to take apart
   - chat to me on the phone about this
   - lend us an old PC that would be safe for this
   - come into school and do the taking apart for the students to see in
   class

Thanks so much,
Sally

On 22nd March, 8 children from AYJS will be competing in an online general
knowledge quiz. To do this, they will log onto a website called
www.buzzerpad.com , a site I haven't used before. The instructions are to
log-on only 10 minutes before the quiz is scheduled to begin.

I'm just checking that this site wouldn't be blocked and I won't need to
make a panicked phone call to you asking for assistance.

Hi Jo,



I believe you were going to send over a report that I could take a look at
however it doesn’t look like we’ve received a report from you?



In regards to your IT issues, if you could forward on this message to your
IT team for them to adjust their firewall, it should fix the issues you are

The email that we need to share it with is: foxton.a@npcat.org.uk

The 'domain'? @npcat.org.uk is our academy so things can be shared between
the two of us. I expect our emails will change in the future.

Thank you for your help. If this could be actioned as soon as possible then
it would be much appreciated! We're up against a deadline.

Many thanks.

,T20230303.0121,Ongoing Issue with drive access personal (Jo Kirkham) and Hull central office HSLT web based budget system access restricted due to smoothwall?,"Good Morning

Can I please open a ticket with Vital for a couple of urgent ongoing (Hull
central based) issues:

*1. Jo Kirkham linking as ASA Not Central* - email j.kirkham@hslt.academty.
No access to central drives via remote/windows login or to desktop or my
drive.
NB I was set up as an ASA staff member during the SALT/HLT merger Sept21
(should  be the central team) .  It appears that I am still currently
linking to ASA not central (giles is aware of this) and due to the stricter
IT segregation now in place I am now unable to access any drives (not even
desktop or my drive) on my windows login as provided/via remote access.  We
are now working in google shared drive but our accounting system works on
windows drive only therefore please can I be advised as to when this can
realistically be looked into and resolved as it is causing me huge issues
and having a detrimental effect on me being able to work effectively.

*2. Orovia/BPS (https://hopelearningtrust.academybps.net/
<https://hopelearningtrust.academybps.net/>) - IT/smoothwall settings HULL
affecting use of the web based system*
Due to the smoothwall/IT restrictions as set currently (Hull) for our
windows machines we are also unable to access the Trust budgeting web based
budget forecasting tool Orovia/BPS fully.
I have spoken to BPS (initially I thought it was a BPS/access issue BUT
they have investigated and I have  also tried using the system when working
across in york office earlier this week to shown Simon Bryan Smith the
issue and it worked correctly) and so BPS have requested that Vital (HULL
offices) contact them directly to try and resolve this please .
*Orovia/BPS contact details:* *Email: **support@orovia.com*

someone look into this for me as a matter of importance?
The registers that Kayleigh refers to are still there as I am able to
access them.  I don't think I have ever had access to the EYFS drive so I
am unable to check.

Subject: Important - Printing on Monday

Hi James,

Just getting in touch to see if we have resolved the printing issue from the Chromebooks/laptops and confirmed that all printers in ICT rooms are printing correctly.

The Y10 tutors will need this information from Monday as they will be printing at the end of the lesson. Currently I've left the printing arrangements as TBC, but as you can imagine last minute info/technical issues can be very problematic for myself and Beth during P3.

If you could give us an update, that would be great.

Have a good weekend when it comes.

Thanks

Shane

Hi Susan

Jo mentioned that there are some outstanding HR policies that they hope to approve at the FGB meeting on the 16th March. Do you have them available from the Local Authority yet?


  *   Parental Leave
  *   Paternity Leave
  *   Leave of absence

Jo - you asked about the Freedom of Information Policy. This no longer exists as it was superseded by the (IGF)  Schools Model Information Governance Framework and (IGF) Information Security Policy which went to the B&G in January.

I'm sure these are already on your radar but I wanted to mention that the following policies are due for review at the FGB meeting on the 16th March:


  *   Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (GN)
https://huntingtonschool.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/Policies/EV4lsUCDfrlKmKyQZ2nVu3cB_F9uMoQYNIXjvL8voLvVhQ?e=raXi6F

  *   Instrument of Government (PJE/MAS) - It is likely that no changes are required to this Matt but just needs to be taken for approval.
  *   Governor Recruitment (MAS/COG) - This is going to be amended by JO

Or just the name - it's just on tight lesson changeovers it's one more thing to eat into lesson time.

At Scarcroft Primary School, we wish to encourage staff to have a healthy
work-life balance, and therefore we discourage the sending of emails
outside of the traditional working day. Where emails are received after
6pm, over the weekend or during a holiday period, it is likely that a
response will be given during the school’s normal working hours. Thank you
in advance for your understanding in helping us to promote a happy, healthy

Hi Rebecca

Please see below. Marfleet was due to change internet service provider at
contract end, which I believe is the end of March. It will be delayed
because of works needed. Can you contact your current provider and ask for
an extension, please, until the end of May?

Can you please let me know, and cc the others in the email below?

Thanks

Good morning



I hope you are well?



I’m just contacting you with regards to the new leased line order for
Marfleet Primary Academy. The order is placed and progressing with our
supplier; however, they have identified some extensive works that are
needed in background to deliver this service. They need to install a
hydracable and they’ve set the estimated completion date of the 23rd of
May. This may be completed sooner, but I can’t guarantee this.



I’m conscious that the new service has a required date of the 1st of April.
Please can you confirm if this is the date when your existing services end?
An extension may be required if this is an option you have, otherwise we
can look at a providing a contingency in the meantime, and until the leased
line is installed. Your account manager, @Helena Brook
<helena.brook@talk-straight.com> will look at what contingency options are
available to the school.



Should you have any queries at all, please let me know.



Kind regards

Hi Sam,

Thank you for getting back in touch with our team via my previous email.

Unfortunately our SIMS user, 'wondeuser' does not appear to have access to
the Personnel Assistant and Personnel Data Exporter permissions as a
minimum to allow us to pull through basic Contract data for at least of the
approved applications requesting this (Osborne Technologies (EntrySign)).

Could we request this is added to our existing user account please? This
appears to be the only failing report and is being requested via Wonde as
this has been authorised by your Academy to share such data.

Many thanks,

Steven Powis

Hi Steven,

This was passed on to our IT department and looks to be resolved from their
end. Please can you confirm if things appear to be back up and running at
your end also?

Many thanks,

this issue of students not being able to log on during music lessons has
now become so difficult that I may have to take the decision not to use the
mac computers. For every single lesson I teach, there are around 5 students
who can't log on. It's becoming unmanageable now and I'd really appreciate
this being sorted out please as students are sitting there for the full
lesson not being able to complete any work and all I do is go round the
class troubleshooting and not actually teaching.

The 5 students in my class yesterday who couldn't log on disrupted the
lesson so much that I had to abandon the lesson and do something else.

Everytime I log on to the teacher mac in L40 I have to change my password -
and then I have to change it on every single computer I work on.
Please, please, could you have a look and see what can be done about it as
it's such a shame not to be able to use them fully and it's causing a lot
of stress.

Many thanks in advance.

This is the colour veil I mentioned to you for my dyslexia.
A student has told me they use it for their dyslexia and it is very good.

Is it possible to download this for me, I understand it is a free download
and can be used across networks.

If we cannot, I will have to buy a new plastic one as I am struggling at
the moment.

,T20230301.0244,Visualiser software - H1,"Hello

I have tried to use my visualiser and I watched the demo and it says I need
to use some software called 'Sphere 2' - I can't find this on my computer.
I have tried clicking on the windows icon and scrolling down to search the
'S's and I have also tried typing Sphere in the search box and nothing is
coming up. I was given a visualiser about a month back but I am wondering
if the software was never put on then because it wouldn't have worked with
Google anyway and then maybe wasn't put on yesterday either.

I wonder if someone would be able to come check or let me know what I need
to be looking for?  - sorry if I am wrong and wasting your time
unintentionally!

Hi there,

Matt from IT county direct has called to try and divert the phones over,
but the new number is not recognised nor when he puts the diverter on
through the school's phone number. Error message says number is not
recognised.
Do you have an update yet? He has taken the divert off for now so we still
have a phone line.

Thanks
Steph

Brady chatterton refused to come to my lesson lesson 3 he came late think
he said he was with SL then came in realised we were in a new seating plan
when he found where he was sitting he refused said it stinks in here and
walked out saying he was not coming in. i may have oncalled to IE work
instead of IE support.

he refused to then enter to room so i on called him.

At lunch time he then started throwing water around at another yr10 boys
and it got a bit heated and Brady told everyone to fuck off and go k,ill
yourselves . he called another girl a fuck bitch.

not sure but i think something is going on with Brady he is not normally
like this in my lessons. could you look into this and see of he is ok?

worried it may continue this aafternoon and he may spiral.

Hi Sarah,

I'm not sure if this is the same for everyone, however, I want to use
Flipgrid (from Microsoft) which is an educational tool. I've suddenly found
myself blocked (at home and at school) so I've sent this email to Vital.

I really need access tomorrow, and I logged the issue on the weekend, but
as yet it has not had a response (either logged ticket or resolution or
response).

Karen said you might be able to escalate it for me?

Thanks,

,T20230301.0161,Thanks and headsup,"Dear Colleagues

Thank you so much to Ben and all that he has done for the school in these
tricky circumstances. His hard work (and ingenuity!) have been admired and
appreciated by all of us.

Just one final thing that I think staff are going to be asking for is to
have the Google drive show up as part of the Windows File Explorer.

Is this something that staff can install themselves or will it require an
administrator account to achieve this?

The problem at the moment is that, for example, PowerPoints open in Google
Slides. In addition, if using a non-Google program, the only option is to
save to the ""h"" drive and then drag it to the Google drive, rather than
saving directly to the Google drive.

Many thanks again.

With kindest regards

Simon

,T20230301.0142,Amplifier set-up S19,"Hi Ben,

I know we chatted about my speaker and microphone issues the other day and
I thought that since swapping the plug from the right side to the left of
the socket had fixed the issue but unfortunately it hasn’t and the system
repeatedly cut out whilst I was teaching today.

Do we think this is now a facilities issue?

Thank you
Lauren

Couple of things please- we have a chromebook trolley that keeps tripping
the electrics in a classroom when it's plugged in. I wasn't sure whether
this would be something that you'd be able to have a look at or if we'd
need to contact the council about it?

Also, the server in Class 8's cupboard is beeping every 20 secs or so and
occasionally rings?

Thanks :)

Good morning

I am emailing to ask if we can have a new email set up. We require it for a
new teacher - Emma Dewdney
Her email, to fit in with the current system, would I presume be:
edewdney@stbens.smccat.org.uk

I have also had a school governor ( Kate Hargerstrand) speak with me to see
that she is having trouble accessing her emails.  Her email address
is:khagerstrand@stbens.smccat.org
Would you mind having a look at it and seeing what the problem is, or look
at resetting it for her.

Many thanks

Gerard

Please see this request from one of our teachers, Emma Case:

Please could you ask Vital if there is any reason why my ipads are not able
to be accessed for downloading photos on the pc.. it says you don't have
permission to access this drive!

I have tried looking in settings etc... is there a quick fix for this?

It's just I need to access the photos electronically!

Hi Adam,

I hope you are well. We are wondering if anyone could remotely sort a simple language problem. IPAD No.1457 is now in a different language. We are guessing one of the children have pressed a button. We have gone into settings and also tried completing by looking at another iPad to revert it back to English. We still can’t do it as we are unable to read what it says. I wish I was that good at languages.
Thanks,

Thank you for updating all the English classroom PCs last week.  I know you
are still busy, but would it be possible for you to install the PaperCut
printing software onto the English classroom computers so that staff can
access the printer from their classroom computers?

I also wanted to ask when we can expect the computers in the workroom to be
updated back to Windows and when we can expect to see the GoogleDrive app
returned to our classroom computers (I know we spoke briefly about this
yesterday).

Thanks a lot.

I know you are really busy but just wanted to flag that the computers in
the library are still out of action following the incident at Christmas. My
computer is running Goole as is one other, which I needed for a student to
have touch type lessons but this one has now had its keyboard removed so is
not working.

Also there used to be a computer under the TV screen in the library that we
ran a display on, this computer has been removed and so the TV is also out
of action.

Hi ICT support,
There seems to be something unusual with Katie's phone line.  If a parent
rings school to report absence, the calls are automatically forwarded to
voicemail.  However, internal calls are fine.  Please can you look at this
as parents need to be able to call and speak to Katie directly.  The
attendance line is accessed externally by calling the main school number,
followed by option 1.
Thanks,
Victoria

17ellisk@fishergateschool.com is actually called Alice, not Ellis - I think
there was a miscommunication when she joined us earlier this month. The
Wonde synch had stopped working, I discovered when I went to look for Alice
and another new starer, but we've contacted Wonde to address this and it
appears to be back up and running now and Alice Kim is showing in the Wonde

,T20230228.0210,Printing difficulties at Haxby Road Academy,"From Ms Cookson <l.cookson@ebor.academy>: Hello,

I am a Speech & Language Therapist working 1 day per week at the Enhanced
Resource Provision (ERP) at Haxby Road Primary.

Since I have started I have had difficulties printing to the
Colour-Sharp-Printers on EBOR-NUC-ACS01.  Some weeks I can print, other
weeks the printer is not installed and when I try to add printer this
fails, with the message:

""We cannot connect to the print server.  this can happen if the print
server was renamed, deleted or moved to a different network..."" Error
#1722.

I use several different computers when I am here which likely doesn't help
but wondered if there was any way you could check what was going on for me
and, if possible, add this printer as a default for me?

Very grateful for your time.

Best wishes,
Laura Cookson

Speech & Language Therapist

Hi Adam

I could do with your help.  As part of my semi retired role, I am delivering training through the Teaching School and some of this is remote using Zoom.  I don't seem to be able to download and set up Zoom on my Dell XPS laptop.  Could this be due to permissions/access?

Can this be done remotely?  If so could someone help with this?

We noticed that your organisation is using the NCSC Mail Check service, but
you have not switched on the DMARC reporting feature.

This email explains why DMARC reporting is important and how to set it up.
Why DMARC reporting is important

DMARC reporting in Mail Check helps assess if emails being sent from your
domains are trusted as legitimate by recipients, based on the anti-spoofing
controls SPF, DKIM and DMARC. The feature provides both interactive email
traffic graphs, as well as our ‘Insights’ feature that will do some of the
analysis for you.

If these anti-spoofing controls are not implemented correctly your domain
is open to abuse from fake emails, and you may have issues with legitimate
emails being sent to spam folders.

How to set up DMARC reporting

There are two key actions to set up DMARC reporting in Mail Check. The
example below is specific to yorkhigh.southbank.academy. Both actions
require making small changes to your DNS record.

Note that DMARC reporting and asset verification will also cover subdomains
of yorkhigh.southbank.academy unless you decide to configure subdomains
separately.

These actions can be done in any order.
Action 1: Create or update your DMARC record.

Status: Not complete for yorkhigh.southbank.academy

This requires you to add the Mail Check address
dmarc-rua@dmarc.service.gov.uk to your DMARC record in DNS. Note you can
use Mail Check alongside other tools already set up. Detailed instructions
are available here:

https://www.mailcheck.service.ncsc.gov.uk/app/domain-security/yorkhigh.southbank.academy/dmarc
Action 2: Verify your domain in MyNCSC

Status: Not complete for yorkhigh.southbank.academy

Asset verification requires you to put a token that we will provide you
into your DNS record. Detailed instructions are available here:

https://my.ncsc.gov.uk/org/db4d7854-fa80-4ab0-ab72-893a51ab2617/assets/8115/edit/verification/?name=yorkhigh.southbank.academy
Feedback and support

If you have any feedback or further questions please get in touch using the
feedback button on MyNCSC https://my.ncsc.gov.uk, or email us directly at

This is just to let you know that I seem no longer to be able to access
emails from Vale using the academy email address. I don’t know if any have
been sent recently, but I just cannot see anything at all from Vale. I’m
obviously concerned about this because I would like to play a full role as
governor and feel at the moment that I am not sure what is going on. Any
help would be very welcome!



Very best wishes,

Hi Sean,

Sorry, but we're struggling to get into these online lessons. We have just
been on the phone with Jodie for the induction ready to start lessons
tomorrow morning, but when we get to the enter classroom bit it's blocked.
Jodie said to bring the laptop back to you tomorrow morning and for your IT
guy to ring her and they can sort it out on the phone together and Sam
could pick the laptop up later in the day and she can try and do the
induction with him again. Does this sound doable?

Thank you,

Jackie

Sam will have been emailed a consent form before christmas from Mr Tasker
regarding having his details used in the leavers stuff (e.g hoodie, leavers
book etc) Would you mind having a chat with him about it and asking him to
fill it out. It's fine if he doesn't want to do it, however it would be
nice to include him in this.

Let me know what you think.

,T20230228.0008,Hempland Staff iPads,"Good morning,

I was wondering how we could go about taking off the apps on the staff
iPads in our school? I have so many apps that are unnecessary and unused
yet don't have the power to cater my iPad to my class's needs as we as
staff have no control over the settings. Is there any way the management of
the staff iPads could be given back over to staff so we can manage them
ourselves? It's just incredibly frustrating now that we can no longer
download pictures through a USB and with all the apps my iPad can hold a
tiny amount of pictures and videos before it's full.

Please can you help,

Subject: Vital: SMART files on Chromebook
To: J Jones <jjones@scarcroft.southbank.academy>


Hi Jen,

Please could you ask Vital:

We have a teaching assistant who needs to access SMART Notebook files for 1:1 teaching.
I've added SMART Notebook Reader and Viewer extension for her but it seems a bit hit and miss whether it works (suspect WiFi signal is patchy in the room she works in).

SMART Notebooks system requirement info says it can run on Chromebooks but I can't find the option when going to download. The free download is fine (just for viewing not creating/editing).

Is there a way Vital can push/add SMART Notebook to her account? Account would be jgibbkirk@scarcroft.southbank.academy

Thank you.

Jacob Sweeting has joined ASA today as part of the PE Department. Please

,T20230227.0194,SIMS,"Hi

I have sent a few tickets through to Vital regarding my SIMs access

I am currently accessing it via the remote desktop but cannot produce any
reports, it just kicks me out when I try.

The only thing I can do is edit lesson marks.  It also logs me out of SIMS
when I have been inactive for a while, but instead of letting me go
straight back in, I need to bring up a new tab and log in via the remote
icon.  Can this be looked into?

I can't do my job properly as I cannot produce the reports needed!  I have
also tried to log in as per the instructions we were sent, but because I am
already on the remote access I cannot follow the steps (I presume this is
why?!)

If anyone has any time to come and have a look for me, I'm in the student
support office!

Thank you!

If Jack does have an alternative mobile device at home e.g a tablet it may

,T20230224.0156,CYC Phone issues,"Hi Vital team

Just to flag up something I’d spoken to Lewis about today and he suggested I raise it via this route.

As you know York Learning have an office at Huntington School from which aspects of our community provision operate. There has been an issue with the phones there for some time – I have spoken to CYC tech support and they say it is in your field not theirs as it is within the school.

The team working there answer the main York Learning numbers via a hunt group/Skype method – if they are logged into their CYC accounts the phone ‘rings’ and they can answer the call using headsets.

They have reported that approx. 50% of the time when they answer the call will terminate without connecting them to the person who has made the call.

Similarly, outward calls, although a better success rate, often do not connect and just drop out without warning.

We are getting a lot of pushback from learners saying they are unable to get through on the phone and/or they are having the phone put down on them, which isn’t true – but obviously it is cutting off and they are interpreting that as we’re doing it deliberately.

There was no pattern to this, apart from today – where it was noticeably better. It was raised that this was a staff training day in the school. The two things may be entirely unconnected but it has occurred to me that perhaps there is some kind of throttle/upper limit which means that on a regular day the calls are not getting through because of regular activity within the school meaning there is no capacity for the Skype call to connect through the system.

Would you be able to have a look and investigate if this is the case or there is some other reason why the calls keep dropping out, and if you can find a problem look at ways of sorting it, please? We get a significant amount of our bookings via phone especially for courses in the Wider Community Learning aspect of our offer and if we cannot rely on the phone connection not only does it cause immense frustration both to staff and learners, including much time spent having to placate people who have got in touch to complain they cannot get through, we are missing out on valuable revenue as people cannot get through to book and go elsewhere.

If you want to speak to me about this happy to have a chat – 07887 545795 – but it might also be worth speaking to Sarah Hammond, who works for me and is the Centre Co-Ordinator for the Huntington School site and is the team leader there. She’s experiencing it day to day. Sarah.hammond@york.gov.uk is her email.

Thank you very much for any help and guidance you can provide.

,T20230224.0142,Chromebook Trolley,"Hi Vital Team,

We were at All Saints' Federation on Tuesday carrying out a H&S Audit, and
in one classroom in the annex (where space is particularly tight) they
currently have Chromebook charging wires plugged in at every available
socket in one of the classrooms.  These wires then trail onto the floor and
are a potential trip hazard to both staff and pupils.

To solve this, we were looking to get a quote for a very compact Chromebook
charging trolley, similar to the style of the one in the picture attached,
but double sided to hold 30 Chromebooks.

Please would you be able to provide me with a price and the dimensions of
the unit to see if we can fit it into a proposed space?  Or if you have any
alternative solutions, your thoughts would be welcome.

Many thanks, Caren

Year 10  - As of today - we still have no photoshop as license is not
synced - The online version that we were using will now not allow students
to open or save work.
coursework deadline is may and this all needs marking

Yr 11 - will not be able to make improvements as we do not have photoshop
3 units need marking if improvements are made

I am unable to mark at home as we can not access the work out of school

I am getting to the point of not knowing what to do - as when the net thing
works it opens up a whole new set of problems and I can not get any answers
on time scale

,T20230224.0123,HR phones,"Hi

I'm getting feedback that the landline phones through to HR don't work and
having had a little try myself, it doesn't.

If I press 2 for HR and then 2 again for recruitment, there's an automated
message saying the person isn't there and there is no scope to leave a
message.  I believe this is because Sophie Sinclair has never been able to
make Cloudya work successfully but could be wrong.

If I press option 4 for general HR help I get cut off.  I don't have
Cloudya open on my laptop but use my work mobile for everything so it would

Please can we arrange a site visit to Easington Primary School to discuss
the below points:

1. Test the unused projector in the hall.  I feel it probably does not work
and it is as old as the hills so ideally we would love a replacement.
2. We also require a second projector in another space (currently not used
but we need to start).  Can you provide and install this?

I know this is costly but Patrington have recently had new all singing all
dancing kits put in there and they have said we may be able to have their
old ones.

Subject: IT Recovery and User Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) Security
To:


Dear Colleagues,

The professional and resilient way in which staff and students right
across the trust have responded to the IT difficulties we are experiencing
has been inspiring and I thank you for your patience as we have negotiated
this difficult situation.

I would also like to recognise the team of staff and technicians at Vital
that have worked significantly longer hours to get us to this point.

As we start to reinstate and make available the Windows network there are
some required security improvements that have been implemented as part of
the rebuild.

One of the changes required will have an impact on staff logins and network
access, so in preparation for this rollout please read through the attached
two documents.  If you already have MFA set up then this shouldn't change
anything but please read the FAQ document anyway.

   - FAQ Document
   <https://drive.google.com/file/d/16wGyc9fXHOh9IjOebnIQXRLUGqXZ3Csn/view?usp=sharing>
gives
   answers to some of the expected questions in relation to MFA and
   implications from our security improvements.


   - Multi Factor Authentication
   <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1StgEkdSWvW2kb_aXuGFSPe393m0xpccQ/view?usp=sharing>
   (Staff MFA setup and Password reset) All staff will need to set up MFA
   using the following instructions when they are given their new windows
   password.


If the documents raise any further questions please send them directly to
myself in the first instance.

Kind Regards

Simon Bryan-Smith

Good morning,

One of our members has reached out to ask the Network for some support -
the details are on the Padlet

you could help, please comment on the post.

,T20230220.0237,IT Equipment,"Hi Helpdesk,

Please can I bring to your attention a few issues we have with screens in
the Ebor main offices (The Leyes site).  I believe Andrew Robinson will be
emailing you to request an additional desk is set up with a docking station
and dual monitors for Cathi Shepherd (FBP), setup required on the bank of 4
desks near the coat hooks.  On that same bank of desks, opposite side,
there are 2 lots of double screens, one is not aligned (has a large black
border) belonging to Heather Measom and on the other set (belonging to
Ellie Ward) one of the screens doesn't work at all.  The laptop belonging
to Ellie also has a battery fault in that it doesn't hold charge, please
can that be fixed too (the 2 reference numbers on the back of the
Lattitude 3510 are, STDB21B63 and EX29022145995, I would be interested to
know how old the laptop is).

Please can you come to the site to fix these issues as soon as possible.

Hi Claire,

I hope you had a good half term break!

I saw the below e-mail regarding a message in “Teams”.  Unfortunately I can’t access Teams for some reason.  Stuart did contact I.T. but I’m not sure what the outcome was.

Please feel free to e-mail me directly if you need to check anything with the Y4 recitals.  I’ve got two pupils in Y4.  I could assess them tomorrow and let you know if / what they could plat next week?

Thanks,
Tom

As you may remember, my class computer wasn't connecting to the new
interactive white board, but it was fixed, thank you! However, when I
turned the board off the connection was lost and I don't know how to
reconnect. Now, the computer itself isn't working at all. The monitor turns
on and has blue, green and red (maybe more colours, I can't remember
exactly) symbols floating about but I can't do anything with it. Would
somebody be able to help me with these issues please? I think I probably
need some training as it's one thing after another these days!!

,T20230217.0076,New VLAN,"Hi,

Would it be possible to create a new VLAN In our unifi environment called SONOS?

Id like the VLAN to only be able to see the infrastructure network, and not staff or student.

Then I can add the SONOS devices in the academy to it, and hopefully no other users will be able to cast their music to the devices


Thanks

Patchett and the file will have been created by Mr Patchett in the summer

Year 9 student Joshua Light.  The document contains the details of a
conversation between Mr Patchett and the student.

This is a confidential request so please only liaise with either Mrs

Could you let me know whether you are able to find and send a copy of this

Subject: Confirmation of Acceptance to Connect the Classroom Programme:
Procurement Pack Attached CRM:0465872
To: Graham School <e.robins@gra.hlt.academy>


In regards to: Graham School

Dear Emma Robins,

Regarding your recent application for Connect the Classroom funding, we are
pleased to confirm that following a review of the information you submitted
regarding your ICT infrastructure in school, we will be able to support you
in carrying out upgrades. Based on the information supplied, our suggested
schedule of items to be funded is as follows:


   - Core Network Switches
   - Edge Switches with Power Over Ethernet and MultiGig capability to
   connect these to your network
   - Wireless Access Points
   - This is in addition to the installation and handover of that equipment

Please note, there are a number of reasons why what you finally need might
differ from the above.

The solution presented to DfE should be for campus-wide WiFi coverage and
as such quantities may differ to what you currently have installed.

We attach a procurement pack for you school containing several attachments.
What to do next

   - Before proceeding further, we recommend that you speak with your ICT
   Support provider about the scope of work in your setting.
   - You will need to issue copies of the attached Procurement Pack to your
   potential suppliers.
   - Once you have a quotation that you are ready to proceed with, please
   return the completed Document 3 Cost Matrix to us along with all supporting
   documentation from your chosen supplier. Return all documents to the
   mailbox address along with your URN in the subject line.
   - *Do not raise a Purchase Order or confirm works until we issue you
   with authorisation to proceed*. Your grant payment is only guaranteed
   after you have received a funding approval letter from us.

Help?

   - Webinars are running to go through the above, step by step, with the
   opportunity to ask questions. You will find a link to join them in the
   instructions or contact us for an invitation.
   - If you need any advice, contact us at:
   ConnectTheClassroom.DfEICT@education.gov.uk
   - If you need assistance in finding suitable suppliers, please contact
   us. We are unable to recommend specific suppliers to you but can direct you
   to places where you can find potential ones.
   - If a supplier has a question about the requirements, you can direct
   them to us for clarification. Please ask them to include your URN ( 146769
   ) in the subject line of any email they send to us so that we know which
   school they are asking about. There are also webinars for suppliers and a
   link is included in their instructions document in the pack.

Regards

,T20230202.0173,laptop issue,"Good afternoon

I have been having issues with my laptop this week. The keyboard will turn
on and off randomly and the laptop screen will turn black or just go off. I
have had this issue before Christmas. I swapped my laptop with another
teacher for the day and she experienced the same problem, so I'm assuming
it is not my account.

I did have my visualizer installed before Christmas but now it will not let
me install and use it. I thought it could be due to my account but then
signing in on someone's account, I still had the same problem. It is
something to do with me not able to select the developer mode on
extensions. I have asked various people to look at this for me in the
school, and nothing seems to be working. Everybody else's laptops and
visualizers work perfectly.

Any help would be appreciated
Thank you

Hi Holly

Would you be able to see if a log in to SIMS.net is possible on the SIMS
server with the Edulink details that are in the agent.

If that's not you then please forward to your IT support as they'll be able
to check this.

It seems as if we have lost connection with your SIMS server.  The log in
is the first thing to check because that's what Edulink uses for the
communication to SIMS.

Kind regards
Julie

,T20230118.0165,Printing to incorrect printers and potential GDPR issues- IMPORTANT,"Good afternoon, this morning I found a copy of a printed student “passport”
on the printer in G2. This is a confidential document to that child.

I went to find the  SENDCO, who said she had sent it to the SEN printer on
the drop-down list. I also know that the printer in G2 is not listed on the
Chromebooks as G2, instead it is listed as G5. I only know this after a
passing conversation with Chris the yesterday- do other staff know?

If staff cannot be certain that the printer that they are sending
information to is the correct printer, then we could very easily have
potential breaches of data. Not only this, at present staff will be wasting
precious time looking for what they have printed and potentially thinking
that it has go lost in the ”ether” and print again; compounding the issue
even more.

Can this be looked into as soon as possible. I would not like there to be
an incident of something confidential being printed, only to find that
confidence is broken.

I do appreciate how busy you all are at present, but this is something that
should not be overlooked.

Thank you

After Marcus came to site yesterday all teachers can now print and can even
print from the computer in Hadid class - Thank you to everyone who has
helped with our printing issues. over the past few weeks.

After speaking to all the teachers on Inset day, I've found out that its
not just the computer in Hadid class that is running slow. All of the
computers in the classrooms and the PPA computer are running slow and its
only mine and Karen's laptop that seem to be ok.

Apparently the issues are when they turn on the computer on first thing in
the morning, accessing websites on the internet and using the drive.

Please can this be checked soon?

,T20230104.0213,audio driver request for chromebooks,"https://www.asio4all.org/

Hi Chris,

this is the audio driver I've mentioned to you previously which has been
recommended for use with chromebooks/bandlab to reduce the latency (audio
lag).

Not needed immediately but for feb half term would be great.

Thanks,
Pip

Hi Warren, I should be able to get that installed on whichever machines you need, is it for specific people or is it general software you'd like in all the computer suites?



I should also be able to get it on the Chromebooks if you'd like too

,T20221124.0206,Students cannot see Google Classroom on the nine dots (waffle),"Hi a number of students are unable to see Google Classroom on their nine
dots. Do we know hey this is.

The reason I ask is that for some students this becomes an excuse not to
complete homework because they could not find Google Classroom.

I know that they can google Google Classroom and click on the right button
to then sign in, but it complicates things.

Is it possible that all students can access Google Classroom through that
nine dots?

Thanks

Well spotted Helen! How on earth did you find this email! :)

We would need to find a wall in Jupiter learning room with an electric
point close by (without an extension) that would be suitable and it would
have to be fitted at a lower height than Tony’s.

We will need to get a price for two more laptops like the one in the hall
from Vital. We also will need a cable like Tony has as well that links up
the devices.

If you get chance I’m happy for you to contact Vital to get quotes for the
computers and also the company (in the email) we used to fit the tv to see
if they would be available to do this. Tony knew this contact and had used
them before.

Thank you,

Caroline

,T20221108.0051,Library,"Dear Vital
I have a couple of requests for the library.
1. There are a lot of computers not working. The children come in to do
homework and there are only 4 that function. Could someone have a look.
2. The computer in the office is not working. We do not actually need this
one now - so if mended could go elsewhere.
3. I have a zoom meeting on 25th Nov -= i need a microphone and camera  -
the library computer has neither ... can anyone sort this out, or find me a
laptop which will work for that day ? Ideally - it would be great if the
library computer was set up for this.
4. There are a couple of questions I would also like answering re the
oliver library system, when you come in !
Thank you

Susie
