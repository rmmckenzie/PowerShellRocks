"","","Fully Funded Courses","From ""Nick Porter"" <nick.wefi@wefindanylearner.co.uk>: Hello,

We are absolutely thrilled to announce that we are offering not one, not two, but THREE of our most popular online courses completely free of charge! Yes, you heard that right - FREE!

But don't wait too long to register your interest, as spots are filling up fast. This is an incredible opportunity that you won't want to miss out on. You can easily sign up on our website at www.wefindanylearner.com/book-online/ or by contacting our team at 01226 958 888.

All you need to do is meet a few simple criteria, including being at least 19 years old by August 31st, 2023, residing in England, and not currently enrolled in an apprenticeship program.

Enrol today and let's make a difference together!

Counselling Skills Level 2
Many people find it helpful to seek counselling at some point in their lives, and a counsellor can provide support for people in all sorts of situations. If you’re interested in supporting people to improve their personal well-being, this course will provide you with the correct understanding, knowledge and skills to do that. You’ll learn about core counselling skills and how to use them in a counselling relationship. You will also be taught about counselling theory and the ethical framework that informs how counsellors use their skills.

Mental Health First Aid Level 2
It’s important that employers are transparent and open about mental health issues, and this qualification builds an understanding of mental health problems and the support available to colleagues. Increasing the understanding of the mental health of staff at all levels builds a culture of care and support.

Understanding Autism Level 2
This course will give you an understanding of autism and the principles of supporting individuals with autism. You will look at the person-centred approach and the influence that positive communication methods can have and will gain an understanding of how individuals with autism can be supported to live healthy and fulfilled lives.

Hi Hannah,

Sorry, I forgot to ask today - I’m working from home on my laptop and the
antivirus software is due for renewal. Is there a specific software package
I need (there were different types listed) and should my laptop have
anything else such as encryption?

This has just sort of evolved and I’ve never thought to check!

Thanks,

Having had...numerous issues with printing recently I have had a response
from Andrew. It seems that the PaperCut software has decided to stop
working on a number of machines (mine being one). He said that if, when you
next start up your computer and you don't see the little box
displaying your current printing balance, then your software has also
decided to stop working.
Andrew will need access to your computer for a period of time when you are
not teaching (anything between 10 minutes and half the day by the sounds of
it!) to reinstall the software.

Hope this helps.

Ok, so the username will be for the PC in school so ignore that for now.

For accessing just email you should only need to use the email address and
password provided.

If you continue to have problems we may need to get Vital to reset your
password.

Let me know how you get on.

"","","St George's (York)","Hello Vital

Shannon is having an issue with the audio on the touchscreen in Y5 at St
G's. Whenever the audio cable is connected there is an extraordinarily
annoying buzzing noise! I popped in today with a replacement 3.5mm jack
cable to connect the PC to the AV faceplate but unfortunately it was no
better. I assume that it is an elecrical inteference issue with the cabling
through the trunking from the faceplate to the sound bar.

Could someone nip in and see if you can do anything to improve it? I don't
know if it is feasible to get a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable long enough to go
directly from the PC to the input or something, to bypass the cabling and
see if that helps...

Thanks
Kat

"","","Touchscreens and ActivInspire in Naburn - odd problem","Hello Vital

Naburn are having an 'odd' difficulty with using ActivInspire on their new
touchscreens. I was in Acorn class where Clare showed me the issue and had
very quick poke at it but couldn't see anything obvious (checked that board
was connected and interactive etc) and had a class of littlies learning to
animate to contend with at the same time (they did ace, btw) so couldn't
spend a lot of time or attention on it! I was later told this also happens
on the touchscreens elsewhere too - I think in the other downstairs (Y3/4)
classroom and the hall.

The touchscreen interactivity is sort of working ok - so i could use the
touchscreen to select and open activinspire from the desktop icon, and once
it was open I could use the touchscreen to select eg the
text/shapes/select/pen tool. I couldn't, however, write into the flipchart
using the touchscreen. I could write/draw using the ActivInspire pen tool
with the mouse/laptop trackpad but attempting to do so on the touchscreen
seemed to treat touch input as a select tool, even with the pen tool
selected.

I think I saw a similar think once somewhere before but can't for the life
of me remember where or what the solution was!

Could someone pop in and take a look please?

Thanks

Hi Adam,

I hope you're well.

I've been asked to contact you due to frustration at St Paul's Nursery regarding the Vital support. Apparently they've been experiencing lots of issues which they keep reporting, that are not being dealt with. Claire and the team are feeling quite unhappy and need some help. Please can I ask you to investigate and progress?

I have had Lenny in my lesson today and he has started out exactly as he

It is intentional, repeated and done to cause distress. This is harassment.

I attach the Edulink log below:

*Making silly noises, calling out, shouting repeatedly. using the Internet
inappropriately repeatedly looking at pornographic images of naked men.
Personally abusive to the teacher, calling me ""weird man"" telling me
repeatedly to ""shut up"" saying ""are you actually ok?"" Shouting this out at

Could you please check the fonts on Louise's pc so that it is the same as
mine.

We have both opened the same file today and one stayed on one page and
Louise's ran into 2 pages.

I believe this is a font that is missing. This is an issue for us as when
staff send files to print they expect it to be the same as they send it
when we print it. For the repro pc's not to match with the rest of school
is an issue for us.

I can supply you the file if you need it.

Afternoon,

Room *C12 *does *not *have a projector or a whiteboard on which to project
power points.  As a geography class has been timetabled in this room (to
facilitate supply cover for AWO's year 8 class) could this infrastructure
be reinstated - hopefully for Friday?  CPR - I have AWO's class set of
exercise books until the room is confirmed.

Kind regards,

Dear Mrs Carr

Please take a close

[https://ssl.gstatic.com/docs/doclist/images/icon_10_generic_list.png] 240318_083114_079_FH.MP4<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fe161bthQ63qXlmU1lIlEYdW5OZbepxj/view?usp=drive_web>[X]

 look at the attached dashcam footage concerning the flagrant misuse of the controlled crossing outside the school.



The footage shows one of your staff dashing across the crossing despite the road traffic having priority. Had I been traveling above the 20mph speed limit then he would now be either seriously injured or worse dead.

You will also notice that one of the school's pupils is correctly using the crossing in order to cross over to the school.

It is not setting a very good example to be setting to pupils, when one of your staff (his name is known) shows total disregard for the rules, incidentally he disappeared into the sports field.

Yours Sincerely

Mr M. Slater

Dear Vital,

The above link is part of our PSE teaching materials. Please could you enable it asap?

Oliver, when it is enables, please could you share with 4s as we were unable to complete. It is about male puberty and growing up. Gareth, hopefully it will be enabled in time for your lesson. If not please could you liaise with Miss Ri so she can share with 4R?

Kind regards,

I'm having problems with Word today and have had similar previously.

Is there a limit to the number of subfolders on google drive that I can
save in?

I'm getting an error message saying 'can't save here' when I try to save in
a folder, but if I go up a level it will then save.

If I then go into file manager I can move the file where I want it but then
when I try to open the word document it behaves very strangely. Word
appears to load but the document doesn't appear, although I don't get an
error.

I've tried restarting my laptop incase that helped but still getting the
same thing.

I really need to have lots of subfolders because I am storing documents
according to the financial chart of accounts categories and they need to be
in the right places.

Many thanks

Dear Mrs Carr

[https://ssl.gstatic.com/docs/doclist/images/icon_10_generic_list.png] 240318_083114_079_FH.MP4<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fe161bthQ63qXlmU1lIlEYdW5OZbepxj/view?usp=drive_web>[X]

 look at the attached dashcam footage concerning the flagrant misuse of the controlled crossing outside the school.



The footage shows one of your staff dashing across the crossing despite the road traffic having priority. Had I been traveling above the 20mph speed limit then he would now be either seriously injured or worse dead.

You will also notice that one of the school's pupils is correctly using the crossing in order to cross over to the school.

It is not setting a very good example to be setting to pupils, when one of your staff (his name is known) shows total disregard for the rules, incidentally he disappeared into the sports field.

Yours Sincerely

Mr M. Slater

"","","Small Basic","Hi James

We are using Small Basic with year 7 after half term. Please could you test it on a student account to check that it will ring properly. I know last year there were some issues with it when we first started, I think it wasn't working when they ran code and a window should appear. There are a lot of non-specialists teaching it and they won't know what to do if it doesn't work.   smallbasic-publicwebsite-code.azurewebsites.net<https://smallbasic-publicwebsite-code.azurewebsites.net/>

Thanks

"","","IT Issue","Good Afternoon

I've received a call from one of the chairs at CWR who has recently got his
pmat email:

ckeeler@cwr.pmat.academy.

He is raising that when on his computer the Find and edit box keeps
appearing so he is unable to write in his emails for example as every time
he types it brings this box back up . Is there anything you can do your end
to help him? I've advised to make sure the keys aren't stuck, which he says
they are not but I'm unsure what else to advise.

Many thanks

with her class. Apparently the projector isn't working and keeps saying
something about a filter needing replacing? If you could please look into
this issue and let her know the outcome that would be great.
Many thanks for your help!

"","","Remote Desktop issue","Hi,

We are unable to access our (original) remote desktop server. The ""temp""
one is unaffected and still works. However we do sometimes need the
original one specifically, as it has some additional admin software on it.

Error is below; I have tried a remote shutdown but to no avail:

I had previously initiated a reboot last night in order to reinstall SOLUS3
for a SIMS update which failed, but the server never came back up.

I have spoken to Adam and he asked me to raise this as a ticket.

My laptop and Jo Sawyer's laptop need upgrading to Windows 11. Whilst the
rest of our school are having their upgrade work done over the Easter
break, Jo has requested that her laptop and my laptop please be upgraded
before the close of school on Thursday please - as the laptops are needed
next week.

Is this possible please?

Many thanks,

Over the last few working days, my laptop has been quite slow. It keeps
restricting access to the shared school server apart from Autumn of this
year. The few times that it has happened I have had to restart my laptop
and this has been during lesson time more than once.

There has also been several occasions where it has not responded to
requests to open SMART notebook slides.

Do you have any idea why this might be happening or suggestions of how to
fix it?

Thanks,
Vicky

At Scarcroft Primary School, we wish to encourage staff to have a healthy
work-life balance, and therefore we discourage the sending of emails
outside of the traditional working day. Where emails are received after
6pm, over the weekend or during a holiday period, it is likely that a
response will be given during the school’s normal working hours. Thank you
in advance for your understanding in helping us to promote a happy, healthy
and productive workforce.

Hi Adrian



As promised, please attached “Example Print Policy”.



In addition, can you please provide a copy of the PaperCut Licence, which
can be found on the print server as follows:



C:\Program Files\PaperCut MF\server\application. license.



We need to use this licence file when requesting pricing from PaperCut for
change of device and/or adding software assurance. By doing so you will
receive discounts.



When I have the licence, I will ask Martin Jeffrey, a colleague to call
your IT person to discuss the existing set up etc. Therefore, I will need
contact details please for said person.



Many thanks



Carl

Hi



Yes, that’s helpful.



Also, I am interested in the following:



   1. Do you have any volume data for each machine, colour / mono split?



   1. Any issues you currently have, what you think the solution to these
   issues look like?



   1. Your IT plan for the coming 18-24 months.



   1. Print Management at each location (papercut etc)?



Regards



Carl

"","","Projector/board 106","Hi Craig,
Attached are some images to show the recent quality of the projector in 106.
These were taken Friday and this morning (Monday).
This is with the blinds down and the lights off.

If it is a sunny day the board becomes pretty unusable as it cannot be
seen, I had the visualiser on this was not seeable at all (not
photographed). Even on non sunny days I frequently have to teach with the
lights off so students can see.

As second in Department I often host meetings and there have been several
complaints from staff who have been unable to read the board due to the
lack of quality.

Due to ASA policy we have to use blue background slides - these slides are
blue but this is not shown and often it comes out as white on the board.
The lower part of the board often lacks focus and is blurred.

I can then look to update the firmware to see if we can get the 2 Sharp machines working with Airprint.

Many thanks

Please can you help me with my V: drive access?  I haven't been able to

I went to the offices (Osbaldwick) and when I returned to work from home,
it no longer let me get into it.  I have tried resetting the machine (and
it was switched off over the weekend) but there is still no access this
morning.

It's quite urgent that I get access back as I have 8 reports to type and
all of the information I need for these reports is on the V drive!

"","","FW: WAMP server installation","Hi,

We are looking to move from our current web hosts and are a bit concerned they will play games (as they are to lose their contract, which is extortionately priced). Accordingly, having a WAMP backup makes sense before we make the necessary requests for transfer keys and so on (for info, the current and the new site will be on siteground). To do this, I understand we need access to the C drive by default (or at least using www.wampserver.com/en seems to suggest). Is there a better way on our system to do this? The website is just under 4gb in size. Any advise or help appreciated.

With my best wishes,

Stuart

Subject: WAMP server installation

Hi Stuart

I've been speaking to a software engineer as part of my bid to ensure we'll be okay if we sever ties with Reborn and that he could carry out maintenance outside the regular updates.

He said in his experience, hosts can play dirty if you try and switch so with his help I've downloaded our website as a back-up.
We now need to test that it will work as a mirror version and for this we need a WAMP server, which we have to download. He'd like to talk you through how to do this, and also clarify our connection with IONIS.
He'd like to speak to you, as our resident IT expert. Are you free to do so, please? He reckons the WAMP download will take 60-90 minutes.

Thanks

Claire

"","","Fwd: Logging into Phone","Good morning,

Further to my email below, it would appear that I am still unable to log in
to the phone system whilst I am in school.
Interestingly I was unable to access the system from home.  Would this
therefore be an issue with TalkStraight as I'm wondering if it's the wifi
that is stopping me from logging in.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards

"","","CE Laptop","Morning,

I am reporting an issue with my laptop from Period 1 today. Midway through
my Year 10 lesson, the computer spontaneously shut itself down without
warning. I tried plugging and unplugging the charger, and plugging and
unplugging the physical battery pack in the back, but could not get it to
work. I took my next class to the library and used this opportunity to drop
off my laptop and charger at the IT desk. I had previously reported issues
with its running speed and USB ports, so my instinct is that it has become
unreliable with age.

Today, I'm borrowing a colleague's machine, but will need a functioning
device ASAP.

Thanks,

Carrie (F8)

Charlotte cannot login to her Google Classroom tonight. The message is that
her password was changed 3 hours ago (so at the end of the school day,

The clock in student reception is definitely out by at least 4 minutes (probably a bit more).
Please could this be corrected as a matter of urgency as I use the clocking in system to issue detentions based on minutes late.
(e.g. I saw Jake Sutcliffe on the mezz stairs going to form at 0844 and I logged into Inventry and it said he signed in at 0846)

transfer parentpay and Edulink over (she is currently at Manor). Please let
me know so I can pass this on when needed.

Alison - I've got the paperwork for her but it's probably going to be
through a managed move rather than through council and I need to get the
go-ahead from Louise Scaum at Manor first (which may need to wait until FAM
next wednesday). I'll get it to you as soon as I can.

Hi Toni,

Sorry I missed your call (assuming it was you).

When on print properties if colour is selected it should automatically override the machine settings and print in colour.



If this is not happening which seems the case, this will need to be looked in to via the IT settings on that users desktop/laptop. This will be something for the schools IT provider to do.

I would strongly advise asking them to set up a call for assistance with our IT support team as they will know also how to locate this issue immediately (unfortunately I don’t). The email for them is softwaresupport@riso.co.uk<mailto:softwaresupport@riso.co.uk>

This may be a slightly random question, but I'm looking at ways to be able
to record students' work and upload it to google drive or to classroom with
ease. If I were to get two cheapo ipads for school use, would you be able
to set them up so that they could log in using the music logins?

It'd only be a couple, but it's working really well in another school!

Good morning all,

We are in the process of streamlining the school contracts for Sign In App
and aligning them into a central portal. In order for this to happen, each
school is required to provide their consent to join the trust contract.

Please could the main user for the Sign In App email support@signinapp.com
(and cc myself in to confirm this has taken place) with the following
wording:

*I can confirm that I am happy to proceed with our school's account (name
of school) to merge into Pathfinder Multi Academy Trust - reference number
SD-22754.*

It is vital that the main user must complete this from the email address
they access the Sign In App system with in order for this to be authorised.

I would be grateful if this could be completed by next Friday.

Many thanks,
Mia

If I attempt to log in via the focus tab on SIMS it says I am logged in but
there are no folders from previous years which should appear on that
screen. If I login through the windows or the google icon this happens
either way

If I attempt to log in via the web site sims-options.co.uk (which I had to
use last academic year) I get the error message below. This happens if I
use the microsoft log in or the google login
[image: image.png]
Please can someone advise how I get onto the system as I need to be doing
this, essentially, yesterday!

Thanks
Karen

Is it possible to have this installed on the exam laptops?

I need to distribute lesson material in digital format to students on the day. Therefore, I would like to find out what methods would be available for me so that students could access the files. Furthermore, I also wanted to check whether there would be any speakers in the room to play videos, if necessary.

Hi Melanie



Please forward this email on to a contact within Danesgate Community or an IT contact who manages your email system.



I have had a look into this and the issue does look to be with your email hosting providers end and not with us, and will need to be resolved by your email hosting providers. Our email filter system will quarantine emails if they are sent to us with a different sender IP address that is significantly different to what is specified in the senders SPF record, this a security feature used to verify if a sender is who they say they are. I have done some further investigation and can see emails being sent to @york.gov.uk addresses, are using a different IP address to that specified in the danesgatecommunity.org.uk SPF record, which is causing the emails to fail SPF checks and to be quarantined. Please see below.



Screenshot from our email filter of a received email (Sender IP: 209.85.208.176):



[cid:image004.png@01DA75F3.A42EBC80]



The danesgatecommunity.org.uk SPF record:



The syntax of the SPF record is correct though, so no issue with the record itself, just the SPF record domains that are included (ie: secureserver.net), which do not contain an IP address that the emails were sent to us on.

[cid:image005.png@01DA75F3.A42EBC80]



The danesgatecommunity.org.uk MX record:

The MX DNS record for the danesgatecommunity.org.uk domain.

[cid:image006.png@01DA75F3.A42EBC80]



Resolution:

To resolve this issue, the email hosting providers for the danesgatecommunity.org.uk domain will need to amend the current SPF record through your external DNS provider to add the current sending IP addresses of the emails that are failing SPF. Alternatively, your email hosting provider can set the externally facing mail server to send out all emails to any domain through the IP addresses specified in danesgatecommunity.org.uk SPF record.



If you need any further information, please let me know.



Thanks

"","","Issues P23 PCs","Hi again James

I didn't get a response yesterday but not sure how to find out if you're in work ATM. I'll try this today.

Having a lot of issues in P23. Several PCs at a time refuse to log on - a reboot fixes most of this sometimes, but it's a bit annoyance when a class is trying to get set up.

I've removed the towers from 2 workstations as they are failing. One just blue-screens every time it's rebooted and the other I emailed about yesterday. It's not uniform with the other PCs, doesn't connect to the network, needs reimaging.

I have the towers on the teachers desk in P23 ready to collect. I'm happy to bring them down to your office if needed.

We have a double class in here on Thu P1 from next week - we need all PCs working or we'll have students unable to work.

Another issue I asked about yesterday - some PCs do not have the Cubase desktop shortcut - how do I get it back? Also some have no file explorer shortcut on the taskbar - how do I get this back?

Thanks
Ian

"","","Issues P23 PCs","Hi again James

I didn't get a response yesterday but not sure how to find out if you're in work ATM. I'll try this today.

Having a lot of issues in P23. Several PCs at a time refuse to log on - a reboot fixes most of this sometimes, but it's a bit annoyance when a class is trying to get set up.

I've removed the towers from 2 workstations as they are failing. One just blue-screens every time it's rebooted and the other I emailed about yesterday. It's not uniform with the other PCs, doesn't connect to the network, needs reimaging.

I have the towers on the teachers desk in P23 ready to collect. I'm happy to bring them down to your office if needed.

We have a double class in here on Thu P1 from next week - we need all PCs working or we'll have students unable to work.

Another issue I asked about yesterday - some PCs do not have the Cubase desktop shortcut - how do I get it back? Also some have no file explorer shortcut on the taskbar - how do I get this back?

Thanks
Ian

Subject: Memory Stick

Hi Adam,

I will be leaving Heworth on Friday and would like to save my folder from the staff shared network so that I can use planning etc from it in the future.

I understand that I can't use a memory stick but the folder is so large that to compress it as a zip folder says it will take 10 hours.

Is there a way you can save the folder for me or override the no memory stick rule at all?

Thanks for your help!

Good afternoon

Apologies for the delay in getting Ellie's rugby video's to you.

We have tried various methods and none seem to work as the footage is too
large.

We will try again this evening, could you advise the best method of
achieving this from previous experience please?

Also Ellie sent an email sometime ago with dropbox links which I believe
you said you never received, would the school email block such emails as
they contained videos?

Any help and guidance would be much appreciated.

Thank you.

We are without a careers advisor and the company that provide us with the
service have arranged for an online advisor to be available.

We are going to do this through Google Meet and Google Classroom - through
the Careers classroom page. For this to happen though, I need to add an
email account to it.

Please can we create an email account:

careers@mce.hslt.academy

that I can have ownership of, to place in the google classroom. This will
allow me to set everything up.

Many thanks,

Morning Rachael,



Can we make the session for 11.30 as that's the end of morning break - he
should then be able to do the session with you in the hour between break
and dinner?



Also, please can I check which on-line platform the meeting will be over?
Tracy raised a very good point that due to the increased security systems
we have in place on the students' accounts, we made need to get something
unblocked specifically for the meeting.



Thanks very much

Good morning Rich and Tracey,



Thank you for getting back to me. I have just had some mandatory training
booked in for 9am-11am on Wednesday 20th March. I have tried to see if I
can move it but frustratingly it is not going to be run for another 6
months. I appreciate that I keep giving you different times, but would it
be possible to book LW in for 11:15am instead? The session will run for
around 40 minutes so he won’t miss his lunch break!

Hi Rachael,



The 10am slot would work best on the 20th out of the times you gave me
although 10.15 would work even better if that's possible as we have a
lesson changeover then.  I`ve copied my colleague (Tracy Fountain) into my
response as I won`t actually be in school on the 20th so I`ll be relying on
her to set this up in school.



Thanks very much

Unfortunately the 2:30pm slot on the 21st has now been taken, but I do have
space on Wednesday 20th March now at 10am or 11am if either of these would
work better than 12pm? Apologies for the confusion.

Hi Rachael,



Thank you for the email on Friday and of the sessions you've listed I think
the session on either Wednesday morning or Thursday 21st at 2.30 would work
better as the session which would start at 12 noon risks going into Leon's
dinner break and I guess he'd be less keen to engage then!



If we went for Thursday 21st I could make sure there's a room and a
computer set up for him to use....if that would still work for you?



Thanks very much

Good afternoon Richard,



The student is L Webb (DOB 2nd October 2009).



Yes, February was a typo – apologies! My availability next week is now a
session at 9am or 10am on Wednesday 13th March, 12pm on Wednesday 20th
March, or 2:30pm on Thursday 21st March.



LW’s sessions are due to take place online via Microsoft Teams (I will
share a link with you), and are scheduled for an hour (although typically
they last between 30-45 minutes).



If you could let me know which of these times would work best with Leon’s
timetable that would be great.

Hello!

I am having some issues with my microsoft surface & wondered if you could
help me please?

I mainly use my ipad in school, but need the surface as a back-up. At
current, it is completely unusable. When I turn it on it comes up with an
error message that it did not reset correctly (I set it off on a factory
reset, and the charging socket was then turned off without my knowledge,
the computer died mid-reset) and will just loop through restarting &
bringing the message back up!

If possible, I am in the shared workroom (L5, in sixth-form) this hour and
P3 if you are able to pop by, or I can come to you if it's easier?

Please let me know!
Thanks,
Christie

Good morning.

We are experiencing difficulties looking at the detentions on ClassCharts today.

When we click on the 3 lines at the top right hand side and select detentions, the detentions are not appearing on the screen.  We can make them appear by clicking on the past tab and then moving to today, but then the filters are not working correctly.

Please can you have a look at this issue to see if it can be resolved?

Hi Jake,

Apologies for the direct email. I think we might have met in Madrid, and I
got your email from @Grace Kelly <gracetk@google.com> . I'm reaching out
because of a recent change we have made to SSL inspection on ChromeOS that
my engineering team has flagged might be affecting your domain when users
sign into ChromeOS. You may already be aware or have solved it, but if not
there are some steps that your Network provider or content filter might
need to implement. I'll copy below the MSA that was sent to admin in
January. Please let me know if you have any questions!

should across all computers. The server needs to have its client also on

"","","Apps needed for computing","Hi there,

I am going to be teaching 'Changing digital images' in computing and need
an app that the children can use and save their work to the google drive.
The suggested apps from the framework are :

○        paint.net (www.getpaint.net)

○        BeFunky app (www.befunky.com)

○        LunaPic (www341.lunapic.com/editor)



Are any of these ok to be installed please? Just one is needed, whichever
is best.

Also there is an app for another topic needed in future called 'turtle
playground' it is a programming app.

Many thanks!

"","","File Recovery","Hiya

One of my year 11 students has screwed up his film coursework and
deleted most of his edit. Because I wasn't in the room he shut the machine
down and then reopened it so isn't able to undo.

Can we recover the save file as it was on his windows profile last week? (I
don't know how the backups work now but I know this was fairly easy with
the old system)

The student is Lewis Wells 19gra-lw21 in Year 11 and the file would be a
*.mlt file; I think in his user profile/documents/videos

Cheers

PaperCut Security News Update 8th March 2024



Hi there,



This is a pre-notification so you can prepare for an upcoming security-focused maintenance release for PaperCut NG/MF.



On the 14th March 2024 (Australian Eastern Daylight Time), there will be PaperCut MF & NG maintenance releases containing several security fixes for newly discovered vulnerabilities.



After a risk assessment of the remediated vulnerabilities, PaperCut has decided to adopt the pre-notification approach for this release. This is to allow organizations to prepare for an upgrade.



We understand these high-priority security patches are disruptive. To protect organizations against potential n-day attacks, PaperCut will not be sharing specific details publicly until the maintenance releases containing all required fixes have been made available on the 14th March.



We are sharing this information with you now to prepare you for the release, and to allow you to plan for scheduling upgrades.





Security issues being addressed



PaperCut has reserved and allocated the following CVEs.

[CVE-CVSS Rating Table]

Recommended customer actions at this time



The upgrade is recommended for all, however, those with PaperCut NG/MF servers that are accessible from the Internet (e.g. open ports), or have untrusted clients within the network (e.g. a large University) are strongly advised to upgrade. These organizations should prioritize and schedule this upgrade for 14 March 2024 AEDT. The upgrade will be available using the existing in-app “Check for updates” link.



We encourage everyone to keep up-to-date with the latest releases. Please see our March Security Bulletin<https://mail.papercut.com/e3t/Ctc/RI+113/cZ-nR04/VWJ87z4SdFSsVp3ypS5QCFthW33LWhB5bnX9NN8GDX6z3lYMRW7lCdLW6lZ3mZW2nMs6k769CpsW7TS6NN69xkYXW2kqRbk61l9RNW4pQMT84TWCzwN4L1K0TW66MWV5R5wt8TwdT2W62Khl27TbPZhW1sm9xC2ntZw8W5yvxrs1Dv1qZW2kJ7nJ1V1P7hW3qXZv27l08qFW5f0XSM6Hnn6xW7N4bPP2Glp1gW6S83XT7LVmh_W16WW275Tjdp-N7x7xncCLNpVW3rly1W6wkDkyW5WTL6x4463VYW6XbpFr3Y486mW7VsnkX3FlYL2N54GG2JC81dlW2RLvNF8fHt8VW5PHfdp41NPtrW6X8jx-7XdWK1f3D-cHd04> for additional information about this release.

"","","Password fix - urgent","Hi,

See below. Governor account, fairly new, seems not to be working properly. The password shows as incorrect, and when I tried to reset, it gave an error message.

We have a full board meeting at 4pm, and the governor needs access for then. Therefore urgent.

With my best wishes,

Stuart

Similar to a problem raised before, I can't access my work account at home

"","","Issue with logging in","Hi,

Please see the photos below - I'm having issues (and another teacher
currently teaching in there) logging into the computer in MA10. It was fine
this morning, but then we went to switch user and this has happened. This
also happened last week after I locked my computer. I think we resolved the
issue by shutting down the computer and restarting it, but is there a way
to solve this problem so either it doesn't happen again or doesn't involve
shutting down the computer because it's slightly frustrating when this
happens at the beginning of a lesson!

Thanks,

Also an issue that has been in place since I started in September. My

be able to drop the Chromebook off, please?

Abigail Bowling needs a Chromebook charger, please can we sort one out for

"","","Hempland Primary","Hi

Please can you advise if it is possible to have replacement chargers for
the laptops that we currently have in school?

Head@Hempland
3 x spare laptops which do not currently have a charger with them.

Recently, Jonny visited school and amended a setting on staff computers to
enable the microphone/camera for the laptops when staff were joining Teams
or Zoom.

We still seem to be having the same problems that when staff join a virtual
meeting they cannot use the microphone or their camera doesn't work.  It
seems the microphone is the more common problem.

If you could advise what setting we need to amend that would be great.

Many thanks

Hi Mr Keens

Sorry to bother you but I am currently having a problem receiving any emails from school to my yahoo address.

I was receiving them, then replying, and people weren’t able to reply to my reply. But now it seems that I am not receiving any emails at all from the @terringtonhall.com domain.

I have checked everything my end - i have no blocked addresses or domains and my inbox is empty. I have tried on several devices and my device is up to date in terms of tech updates.

I am also receiving all other emails as usual and can reply and others can reply.

I have googled the issue and it does seem like others have had the same problem. I am wondering if any other parents with a yahoo address are having a similar issue with school emails?

Any help appreciated!

Many thanks
Catherine

*George Middleton*
SIMS initial Access:

Classcharts initial access:

Class charts will send a link to their school email address.
All initial passwords will expire on initial use, and they will need to
create their own for future access.

Please do send them my way if they need support with any of these, or
Markbook use.

Penny,
Could you add '2 factor Authentication' to the 'to-do' list, as this cannot
be set up out of school.

Hello Mr Peattie I hope all is well.
I wonder if you can help me with login details for edulink. Apparently
these details were sent out in 2021 but the family have no record of this.
We're trying to get an appointment for parents evening on Thursday but that
needs to be done through Edulink so if you could please resend the login
details, I'd appreciate it.

or search for Ebor Talk on Spotify.

In this special, feature-length edition, we explore how and why Ebor
Academy Trust was set up and speak with key people involved. Former Haxby
Road governor Rachel Totton, now chair of the trust, explains how the
school was ""rescued"" thanks to local intervention. Founding chief executive
Richard Ludlow talks about the beginning of a remarkable journey a decade
ago, which led to 23 schools joining Ebor - so far.

Finally, chief executive Gail Brown reflects on how the pandemic changed
everything and, looking ahead, how a school-led system can champion school
improvement.

*Sophia's persuasive letter makes a difference*

A Year 4 pupil at Sigglesthorne Church of England Primary Academy has
helped stop nuclear waste being stored nearby - thanks to the strength of
her argument.

Eight-year-old Sophia, pictured with her little sister Louisa, wrote a
persuasive letter to MP Graham Stuart, expressing her concern at plans for
a geological disposal facility in South Holderness. She said she was
worried for her and her eight months (and at the time, one day) old baby
sister.

Sophia's letter was read out at a council meeting which voted to withdraw
from talks.

Jenny Marsden, Sigglesthorne headteacher, said this is a: ""really inspiring
story of the power of the pen and how children can make a difference.""

*Be aware of our whistleblowing policy*

While Ebor is rightly proud of its track record of high ethical standards,
the trust is not complacent and keen to make staff aware of what to do if
they suspect malpractice.

There is a whistleblowing policy on our website – which you can view here
<https://academy.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5586cab741f740b46ecbb892c&id=e00f1f9351&e=1185becab7>
– that explains the steps to take and the procedures which will be followed.

The trust wants everyone to feel able to raise their concerns and know that
any reports will be taken seriously and investigated. We would rather any
matters are raised early, when it’s just a concern. Remember, as a
whistleblower you have employment protection.

Many current – and distressing – news stories make reference to employees’
concerns not being taken seriously and matters escalating, sometimes
horrifically. Please be aware that the trust wants to be one step ahead at
all times so that everyone is protected.

Your line manager, headteacher or chief executive should be informed,
preferably in writing, if there’s anything you feel uneasy about at work.
Andrew Winter is our whistleblower trustee, and he can also be contacted
confidentially, via Wendy Harrington.

All details are in the policy.
*New Coaching Professional apprenticeship can help you and others *

If you're interested in cultivating excellence and in helping others unlock
their full potential, then Ebor's new Level 5 Coaching Professional
apprenticeship programme is for you.

The programme, expertly designed to meet industry standards, will support
not only your personal and professional growth but also provide you with
the ability to empower others to make a transformational impact. Completion
of the 15-months programme leads to certification as a Coaching
Professional. There is no financial cost to the participant - like all
apprenticeships, funding comes from the apprenticeship levy. Ebor is a
pioneer in apprenticeships for education.

Sue Hinchcliffe, director of apprenticeships, said: ""In a world where
personal and professional development is paramount, training as a coaching
professional has the potential to equip you with the skills, knowledge, and
mindset to make a meaningful difference to both individuals and
organisations alike.

""I really hope colleagues will embrace this exciting opportunity to become
a catalyst for transformation.""

For more information, see our website here
<https://academy.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5586cab741f740b46ecbb892c&id=94f04c5cb7&e=1185becab7>
.
To register your interest, email apprenticeships@ebor.academy. Application
deadline is 31 April.
*Consider our HLTA programme*

Headteachers, have you started thinking about staffing for next year? Why
not unlock potential and save money by investing in Higher Level Teaching
Assistants?

*Cost-effective solution:* Investing in HLTAs offers a cost-effective
alternative to hiring additional teachers. By leveraging the talents of
HLTAs, schools can maximise resources without compromising on educational
quality. A wise investment strategy which yields long-term benefits for
both students and schools.

*Career development opportunities:* Promoting the role of HLTAs not only
benefits schools but also creates rewarding career pathways for aspiring
TAs. Through our Preparation and CPD programme, HLTAs are empowered to
advance their skills and contribute meaningfully to the educational
community.

*Positive impact on student achievement:* Research indicates that schools
with a strong support system, including HLTAs, experience higher levels of
student engagement and academic achievement.

By investing in HLTAs, you're investing in the future success of our pupils
and fostering a culture of excellence in education.
• *If being a HLTA is something you're now thinking about, have an
initial chat with your headteacher.*

HLTA training dates:
  Date Time Focus
Day 1 Tuesday, 16 April 2024 9.30am - 4.00pm Preparation Day 1
Day 2 Tuesday, 30 April 2024 9.30am - 4.00pm Preparation Day 2

Just wondering if you could help with the audio on my dell laptop (class

where the audio settings are to reduce the bass or maybe it needs new

"","","Papercut login","Hi,

I used to be able to log into to the papercut to add printer codes for
staff or to remind them of their printer code if they cant remember,
however when I tried to log intoday it came up with site cannot be reached

I have got this saved as a bookmark so I am not sure if anything has
changed.

"","","More problems with pupils' accounts","Hi Vital,

I'm trying to teach an ICT lesson at the moment, and am again coming across problems with children's accounts. At the moment Jake Seccombe in Year 5 is logged onto one of the laptops, and is able to access the internet, but his OneDrive is not syncing. He can log into his email, and from there he can get into OneDrive through the browser, but it does not let him access one drive through File Explorer - when I click on the little cloud icon in the bottom right hand corner, it says that he needs to log in, and takes me to the 'Set up OneDrive' window, asking me to enter his email address. When I do that, it says that the username is incorrect.

I've restarted the laptop several times but it has not helped. Any suggestions for what to do in this situation?

Thanks,

"","","Re: New starters","I have just done the tour for this family. They were lovely. Dad explained
the move of schools is because they live closer to AHS than Jo-Ro. They
moved to the UK in November 2023.

I have agreed a start date of Wednesday 13th March. Dad will let us know if
we need to push this back, however I said this was the earliest we could do.

Both Albertina (Y9) and Andre (Y7) are currently studying French, if that
needs to be taken into account in terms of banding.

In terms of GCSE options for Albertina she would like to do Geography,
History and Media. These are the options she picked at Joseph Rowntree. Are
these options ok Alexis?

Can you shed any light on this? Is it anything that needs to be actioned?

Email from harry Parkinson

Hello! I recently found a potential problem with the computers, completely
by accident*
By creating a shortcut on the desktop and opening its properties, you can
change the icon for the shortcut.
image.png
By default, most icons are stored in the Shell32.dll file in the System32
folder, C drive.
The C drive is not normally accessible with the permissions in place, but
by pressing ""Browse"", we can access it.
image.png
The user can copy over some important files to their desktop from the newly
opened window, e.g: Command Prompt; basically complete control over the
computer.
The command prompt is also disabled - which is good - but by navigating out
of C:\Windows\System32 and to C:\Windows, the user can copy another tool
called Powershell.
Powershell is an alternative to the command prompt, but it works if you
move it out of the folder and is not disabled.
It could be used to disable restrictions, corrupt the computer and most
likely more. (Note: most actions require admin rights, but someone smarter
than me could probably figure it out from there)

I have found an article showing how to potentially fix this issue:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/683011/prevent-an-user-of-editing-desktop-shortcuts-addin

*Basically I was just changing an icon and I wanted a different one - which
was in a separate file called Imageres.dll - so I pressed browse to choose
it and discovered this

Thank you for reading!

And also, Powershell can be used to download content that would be normally
blocked through the browser.

The issues addressed in this release were part of our existing security
uplift program which involves internal teams reviewing their code,
penetration testing from external parties, and leverages the strong
relationships we’ve built with researchers in the security industry post
our 23 March 2023 security incident.
<https://infotechnologysupply.com/c/AQjpqQUQqNrtBhiEj7bRAiDohOSbAQURPW--GKk7-FSQeYBgc0SIfN0F4b3kxY9JaxkSQPQS>

Many of these issues were found by researchers working with TrendMicro as
part of their ZDI program. All of these have been responsibly disclosed to
us by Trend Micro. We've worked closely with Trend Micro’s ZDI team over
the last 12 months to ensure any of their findings with PaperCut’s products
are consistently disclosed collaboratively.

"","","Your help/advice please","Hello both

A different issue I'm hoping you can help us with.

We have a number of recordings of Zoom meetings that we have to crop and
send off for Quality Assurance purposes.  We cropped them using
Moviemaker software (advised by an IT teacher!) but can't open on Google
Drive and they take forever to open on a computer.  Should we have used a
different software or can we convert them into a different format?  I can't
really see any options.

Thanks,

I understand there is something called MCE-Guest. I've copied in the IT
team to ask them how you access it. Carl copied in - this is for music

If you’re interested in supporting people to improve their personal well-being, this course will provide you with the correct understanding, knowledge and skills to do that. You’ll learn about core counselling skills and how to use them in a counselling relationship. You will also be taught about counselling theory and the ethical framework that informs how counsellors use their skills.

Mental Health First Aid Level 2
It’s important that employers are transparent and open about mental health issues, and this qualification builds an understanding of mental health problems and the support available to colleagues. Increasing the understanding of the mental health of staff at all levels builds a culture of care and support.

Understanding Autism Level 2
This course will give you an understanding of autism and the principles of supporting individuals with autism. You will look at the person-centred approach and the influence that positive communication methods can have and will gain an understanding of how individuals with autism can be supported to live healthy and fulfilled lives.

Classroom is still not working after you spoke to me last night. It's
really frustrating as I've had no problems with it until yesterday.

I really need to be setting catch up work for students, so please can it be
resolved asap?

Thanks

They hasn't got WiFi at home or the use of a computer and is really struggling to keep up with her A Levels. I just wanted to try and help if there was any way I could. They are so badly off but are not eligible by pence to claim the bursary. Jaime is often hungry and has no phone.

No worries if not, just thought it was worth a try. I know we aren't a charity.

I have just gone to print release this afternoon and the same issue has
occurred, with a fault regarding the finisher. This same problem occurred
to me this time last week and meant the printer was not working for a
couple of days. This may not be the solution, but I'm wondering whether it
is something to do with the paper we at the ERP are using that is causing
these problems.

Please could you check and, if necessary, disable t eaccounts and remove
them from the directory/all.governors?

Graham Whitmore gwhitmore.governor@fishergateschool.com
Francesca Moxon fmoxon.governor@fishergateschool.com
Tamsin Tinkler ttinkler.governor@fishergateschool.com
Charlotte Johnson - I think this has already been removed
David Allen - I think this has already been removed

It might be handy if I could get a current list of the membership of

There will be a couple of new governors to set up I think - I'm just
getting their details together,

Can you create a new account for desktops called Guest2 with the password

Can this account have Youtube access as the Guest account we currently use
doesn't seem to still be working with youtube for whatever reason, it's
probably best to start a fresh.

This account will be for visitors who need youtube access for their

Unknown To address

How to Fix It
The address may be misspelled or may not exist. Try one or more of the following:

  *   Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and choose Send Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link ""To send this message again, click here."" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send.
  *   Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct.
  *   The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly.
  *   Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532972>, and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send.

If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below.

________________________________

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.1.10

This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:

The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.

Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.

Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature.

Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit).

Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.

For more information and additional tips to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532972>.

Just for a bit of extra information (sorry, I don't know what ticket number
it will be, but hopefully you can merge) this is the Y4 classroom (had a
similar issue in the Autumn term but that eventually resolved) and from
memory it is AP6 in that room. In fact - checking through ol email, please
see attached a pic of it!

Hello! I recently found a potential problem with the computers, completely
by accident*
By creating a shortcut on the desktop and opening its properties, you can
change the icon for the shortcut.
[image: image.png]
By default, most icons are stored in the *Shell32.dll* file in the S
*ystem32* folder, C drive.
The C drive is not normally accessible with the permissions in place, but
by pressing ""Browse"", we can access it.
[image: image.png]
The user can copy over some important files to their desktop from the newly
opened window, e.g: Command Prompt; *basically complete control over the
computer*.
The command prompt is also disabled - which is good - but by navigating out
of *C:\Windows\System32* and to *C:\Windows*, the user can copy another
tool called Powershell.
Powershell is an alternative to the command prompt, but it works if you
move it out of the folder and is not disabled.
It could be used to disable restrictions, corrupt the computer and most
likely more.

* (Note: most actions require admin rights, but someone smarter than me
could probably figure it out from there)*I have found an article showing
how to potentially fix this issue:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/683011/prevent-an-user-of-editing-desktop-shortcuts-addin

*Basically I was just changing an icon and I wanted a different one - which
was in a separate file called *Imageres.dll* - so I pressed browse to
choose it and discovered this

"","","Chromebook Trolley - Animal care","C Dixon
12:50 (1 hour ago)
to me

Hi Craig, I'm missing 3 laptops from the animal care trolley. Students turn up from cooking to ask to lend them and sometimes people let themselves in and take them when I'm not in the room. I've rang the classrooms asking if they have them but they say they have brought them all back. I stress to them everytime to return them and they do, but now 3 are missing and I can't find them anywhere, which makes me think they've been taken when I'm not here. Is it worth putting a note in the breifing to ask if anyone has spotted them?
I will keep the trolley locked when I'm not in here and I'll say no if they ask to borrow them, until the other 3 are found.

Thanks

We have GL assessments scheduled for 3 weeks from the w/c 8/4/24 so will
need at least 60 Chromebooks with internet access via Chrome.  This has
usually involved redeploying the machines set up to use Trelson software

"","","St Barnabas Primary - IT inventory","Hi,

Please can you help with the following re the quantities of kit at St
Barnabas:

Ipads - the school has 20 which are school owned but we are being charged
for 31.

The school has 30 leased chrome books and 22 school owned plus 3 old D of E
Laptops which I understand are now chrome books? However I believe they are
being charged for more than this?

Lap tops - 3 leased and 1 school owned. There are 2 that have been waiting
to be collected since the new laptops arrived last year? I believe we are
being charged for more than this?

I also attach an inventory list - please can you advise if you can support
and add in the lease dates and for the ones that we own the date they
become defunct as they are no longer able to accept updates.


Thank you for your help with this,


Viv

Recipients
Unknown To address
Couldn't deliver to the following recipients:
louise.burnell@woodlesford.leeds.sch.uk, jessie.johnston@woodlesford.leeds.sch.uk

How to Fix It
The address may be misspelled or may not exist. Try one or more of the following:

  *   Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and choose Send Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link ""To send this message again, click here."" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send.
  *   Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct.
  *   The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly.
  *   Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532972>, and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send.

If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below.

Was this helpful? Send feedback to Microsoft<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525921>.
________________________________

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.1.10

This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:

The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.

Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.

Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature.

Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit).

Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.

For more information and additional tips to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532972>.

Subject: :: Please reply : DfE Schools Gigabit Broadband Connection for Your School :: Site Survey Visits


Referring to 121564 Green Hammerton Church of England Primary School

Dear Sarah,

This is to follow up on our email of last week. Since we sent it we have been able to revise some contact details, so if this email is new to you and needs further explanation please don’t hesitate to get in touch using the information at the end of this message.

BT plc or BT Openreach, are arranging survey visits to sites in the coming months and have asked us to confirm some information for them.

Action

If you are not the best person for them to speak to, please let us know by replying to this email with the correct details.

Below is some information they will need to do the survey for your school. We have filled in the details for you, based on what we know. If you can either confirm they are correct or change anything that needs to be altered and reply by email that will save us calling you.

URN: 121564

Site (School) Name: Green Hammerton Church of England Primary School

Listed Building (Yes/No):  No - this is to allow us to alert the supplier if the building the connection will come to is listed so they can take the necessary steps. If you do have a listed building, but it isn’t one that the connection comes to, we should answer this question as “No.”

Is the router required to be rack-mounted?:  Yes - this is to tell the supplier if they need to mount any equipment in a rack or cabinet. We would usually advise answering “Yes” to this for now. If you have this kind of equipment on a desk or table, we can change this answer to “No.”

Floor:  Ground- this is the floor of the building the connection will go to. We will assume the Ground Floor unless we are informed differently.

Room:  Server/Comms Room - this is the room the connection will end in. We have entered a default answer here, but you may wish to tell us of a different location such as the main office. Obviously, it is important the connection ends in the right room in your school.

Cabinet/Rack Name: Main - for a school that has several communications cabinets, we may need to talk about this with you, in most cases the answer we have entered here will be sufficient.

Building Name:  Main Block - We will need to tell the supplier which building at your site the connection must go to.

Does the site belong to a 3rd party?:  Yes, North Yorkshire – if you are an academy this should be the name of your academy trust, otherwise it would usually be your local authority.

Primary contact name:  Sarah Barker

Primary contact telephone number: We will normally give them your main switchboard number. Please advise if they should use a different line.

Primary contact email address:  admin@greenhammerton.n-yorks.sch.uk

The supplier can also have a secondary contact to use in the event that the person above is not available – we would need a name, email and phone number for them.

Sufficient power & space available for the ONT?: Yes - the connection will be terminated with a small box on the wall, which needs to be plugged in when in use. We will assume that a power socket will be available,

Is an induction course or training required for attending field engineers? We will assume this is No. If your site has special requirements, over and above those normal in a school setting, please let us know.

Is security clearance required?:  We will assume this is No. If your site has special requirements, over and above those normal in a school setting, please let us know.

Is an Asbestos Register available?:  We will assume you have an Asbestos Register at your site (it is a legal requirement) that can be shown to any visiting engineer and answer Yes on your behalf. Please let us know if this presents a problem.

What to expect

As part of the process, BT plc will usually arrange three surveys.

One will look at the route to your area from the exchange. You probably won’t be aware this is happening.

The second will be outside your school in the street. They would not normally need to come onto your premises to do this.

The third one means an engineer visiting you, and they will need the information above to do that.

The surveys can happen in any order, and we are working hard to have the all completed as quickly as possible so that we can get your connection arranged soon.

Once all three surveys are done we will expect to be given an indication of when your installation will take place.

If you have any questions, please contact us at Schools.FIBRE@education.gov.uk with your URN and School Name in the subject line.

Regards

Inventry isn't working again.

I need a more permanent way to access this because I'm using it more and
more.

I don't understand why it seems impossible to stick it to my desktop and
every time I go to use it it has gone again??? - Is it something I'm doing
wrong?

Much appreciated

Janine

I know I have contacted you on a number of occasions about the password
spreadsheet we have. As you can see from this email more login and
passwords do not work. This spreadsheet is the one sent back to me by
yourselves a couple of weeks ago as it was checked and reviewed. However we
are still having the same issues.

I have attached the spreadsheet sent back to me and is the most updated.

One of our students (Lacey Fewlass) is unable to log on to her account.  A
message pops up saying that the account is no longer active. This may be
because she left us last year but has now returned. Please can this be
looked at? She needs to complete coursework on a computer and therefore we
need to her logged on ASAP. Her previous username was

I have several members of my form who have an ipad and smoothwall and
cannot connect to the internet, I have sent them to the IT office for
support during form time and they have come back either being told to wait
and see if the student ipad network appears (which it has not) or given a
chrome book and a warning that they won't be able to borrow one in the
future (their words). Can we have some clarity on this? I am sure there are
good reasons for it but as teachers/form tutors we feel confused and left
in the dark as to why students who have smoothwall and done everything
correct still cannot connect? Tomorrow, when they come in and again won't
be able to connect where should i send them?

It is asking for a username, serial number and tenant id on several, how do
we fix that?

All the best,
Stephen

I'm not sure that you would be the people who sort this out....
I have just been asked by a TA how they would have their name put on so
they can print their own documents from print release on the photocopier,
rather than share with a teacher.
Is this something you sort?

Could we please request that a reboot of the dreytek on site is performed
in order to restore the connection. Could you also please double check the
cabling as well as we do not see the dreytek plugged into our main router.

Is there possibly a reason this device was unplugged and could this please
be reconnected?

If you have any further trouble with the connection please do not hesitate
to contact us for assistance.

"","","Showbie slow","Hi Vital,

please can you check the permissions for both the showbie iPad app and the
www.showbie.com website.

I noticed last week some students couldn't upload videos to their online
music book (on Showbie) and others could but it took 15-20 minutes to
upload a 10 second clip - it used to take 5-10 seconds to upload. I've
tested it with my own 4G connection and Showbie was working instantly, so
it's a Wifi connection issue.

I'm now using the HSLT-Hotspot for my teacher mac and I've got similar
upload problems although mine is slightly faster than the iPad - still
takes a few minutes to upload. One additional thing I am struggling with
today - to mark work I have my work email set up to receive automatic
notifications with hyperlinks from Showbie when each piece of work is
handed in - this allows me to click on the link in the email and mark the
work instantly without going through the reams of menus to find the piece
of work. This morning each click is taking longer - feels like extra
security is stopping the Showbie site from loading as normal. According to
the Showbie admin dashboard I've marked just over 5,000 pieces of work in
this way so far this year, so you can see the scale of the problem.

Please can you look into it for me

cheers

Dave

"","","New Photocopier Info St Georges Catholic School - Requires Drivers and Scanner Setup","Hi,

Old Printer
Model - Share MX-5070V
IP Address - 10.18.84.14
Mac Address - 34:5A:06:83:56:24

New Printer Info
Model - Kyocera Taskalfa 6054ci
Mac Address - D4:F0:C9:0A:06:42
IP Address - 10.18.84.78 (currently on dhcp)

Drivers
https://dam.kyoceradocumentsolutions.com/content/dam/gdam_dc/dc_global/executables/web/Kx84_UPD_8.4.1716_en_RC5_WHQL.zip

I would usually do install printer manually, have disk and point it to the
64 bit folder extracted from that archive. In the list the printer is the
Kyocera Taskalfa 6054CI.

The Admin password for accessing the printer via web interface
Username - Admin
Password - Admin

I've included the address book of the old machine for the scanner it was
setup to scan to email. They would like that setting up again.

They also had whats called Secure Print. On this machine once its setup on
the print server its basically a tick box in printer properties, printing
defaults, on the left hand site one of the last tabs it has print location
which needs to be set to secure print - prompt for password.

Feel free to give me a call if you require any more info Mike - 07874215011

Cheers,
Mike

"","","Projector in hall","Good morning

The projector in the hall is flashing between a blue screen and off every
few seconds, when trying to duplicate the computer display. It seems like a
connection fault, as when not connected to the PC, the screen stays blue.

Please can you ask Jonny to call asap as not sure if it's something he can
fix or we need to go to Elementary who it was purchased from?  It's only a
few months old.

Thanks

Gill

"","","BBC iplayer Smoothwall","Morning,

I'm blocked from BBC Iplayer which I'd hoped to use to show my Year 9 group
a dramatic reading of the Lonely Londoners text we're teaching this term.
Other English teachers don't seem to have this problem and have been able
to access the site, rather than the smoothwall block appearing on screen.
Could you adjust smoothwall settings so that I can use the resources on BBC?

Thanks,

Carrie

Good Afternoon,

I was chatting with Claire Wainwright who says there is an alumni email address (Alumni@terringtonhall.com). We tested out sending an email to it and it automatically forwarded to  Claire -'office' email and to Claire White. Is there a way that I can have access to the email and if the forward can be taken off it?

Thank you,

Hi Craig

I've got visitors from St Mary's College coming in next week and they need to use the WiFi, purely just to be able to show a Youtube video during an assembly they're doing. Do they still need to sign that big contract if it's a one off and only for a few mins?

Hi Adrian,



The office have some guest codes I asked them to hand out to the Parish
council for the schools guest network.

I created some 90 day codes specifically for the Parish to use on their
laptops.

if they have a physical PC please let me know and we can do something
slightly different for this.



There is a new CYC switch in that cabinet that I can see, we haven't
changed anything with this device, is this just for the CYC staff that use
that office?



Thanks

If you get the school office to log it as a job through the helpdesk our

Hi Russ,



This is fantastic, big thank you.



Ref the hardwire device config – the tenant will yes be looking to connect
up a fixed pc in due course to the data points in the office. Is there a
set one they must plug into or can it be any port in the room and then the
back switch room config will sort the rest so it works?



Thanks again,

Mark

Hello,

Sorry to bother you but if I was to buy Lila a 2nd hand ipad for the
purpose of being used as school equipment, what would the minimum technical
requiremts be in order to add smoothwall and successfully use it at school?

How old can it be and what level of memory capacity would it need?

Many thanks

Dear Mrs McNair,

Please can you add Lila Russell to the list for a stock Ipad?

Lila shares an ipad with her little brother, and both are home from school
by 3.35pm, so we don't wish to have the ipad under school rules until
4.30pm, nor do we wish to be bogged down by some of the problems others
with smooth wall have complained about.

As such, at this time we do not wish for smooth wall to be added to our
personal Ipad. If we meet with unforseen problems using the stock ipads, we
can revisit this decision, but hopefully that won't be the case and Lila
can pick up and return the stock ipad as is needed, while using our ipad
for any homework etc outside of 0830 to 1530.

Kindest regards
Julia Russell.

*Subject:* iPads and WiFi


Good afternoon


* Firstly, apologies to those parents who have already responded to one of
my previous emails.


* Secondly, this only applies to students in Yrs 7-10.


* If your child is in Yr7 or Yr8 and has an iPad through the school scheme,
they will already have Smoothwall on their device, so please ignore this
email.


* *But, this email does apply to students in Yrs9 and 10 who have a device
through the school scheme, and to all students in Yrs7-10 who have an iPad
which is not through the school scheme. *


As you may be aware, we recently changed the WiFi at Manor CE Academy which
means that devices without the Smoothwall software can no longer be used.

The safety of our school community is paramount and in line with Keeping
Children Safe in Education 2023, we are now required to ensure that
appropriate filtering and monitoring software is in place within our school.


In order for your child to use their iPad in school, Smoothwall must be
installed on the device.  This software is a safeguarding tool that
monitors keystrokes which can help identify when a student is accessing
something online that may cause them harm.  The software will be active
from 08:00 - 16:30 Monday to Friday, school days only.  It is not active at
weekends or during school holidays.


We are in the process of adding the software to all school IT, including
personal iPads.  To that effect, if you are agreeable, please would you
complete the consent form here
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2ht9f2c9ISX1iVQKAY1nFvFaUaItVQg0aZKQEMRPIK2Uvnw/viewform>.
Once we have permission, your child will be added to the list for a stock
device until such time as Smoothwall is added to their iPad; group sessions
are being organised to facilitate this.


If you do not wish for the software to be added to your child’s iPad, they
can use a stock device, on a first come first served basis, but you must
respond to this email advising that you do not want the Smoothwall software
on your child’s device.


Should you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact me.

As briefly discussed, can I please make a request for 3 of the

the following please;

Computer 1 (Lindsey's) to the corner area
Computer 2 (Jodie's) to first station area
Computer 3 (with card machine/Infinity built-in) to the middle station

Lindsey starts at 9am, so if there is any chance this can be done in the

The supply in 105 has reported issues with the projector.
Someone has used the room earlier in the day and changed the display
settings but when I've reverted this back to one screen the Projector will
not connect to the screen and is just blue.
When on extended it was displaying but then wouldn't once I did above.
The supply said during P4 they could not get it on at all, or their
monitor.
So I'm not sure what's going on. Could you please come and have a look?
She is not teaching there until tomorrow.

"","","Inappropriate Website","Hi,

I am not exactly too sure who to contact in this instance but it has been
brought to my attention that a Y6 pupil, Margaret Connors (
24m.connors@staelreds.npcat.org.uk), has been using 'SoundCloud'. We are
concerned that she is accessing songs with inappropriate lyrics. After
looking at SoundCloud's Privacy Policy, it states that it should not be
used by children. I am not sure if she's signed up for an account or is
just able to play songs. Please could you block access to this website for
our children?

Children

Subject: WAMP server installation

Hi Stuart

I've been speaking to a software engineer as part of my bid to ensure we'll be okay if we sever ties with Reborn and that he could carry out maintenance outside the regular updates.

He said in his experience, hosts can play dirty if you try and switch so with his help I've downloaded our website as a back-up.
We now need to test that it will work as a mirror version and for this we need a WAMP server, which we have to download. He'd like to talk you through how to do this, and also clarify our connection with IONIS.
He'd like to speak to you, as our resident IT expert. Are you free to do so, please? He reckons the WAMP download will take 60-90 minutes.

Thanks

Claire

Hi both
Hope you are well. I am raising a concern regarding the broadband at GPS.
In the last few days we seem to be having regular issues where the internet
is slowing down / cutting out altogether. I am getting messages from staff
recording concerns as all our work / registers / everything really is now
cloud-based. Is our broadband connection sufficient? Are you able to tell
if we are reaching capacity and if this has happened this week? As an
example, I had 40 minutes today where Google would not open for me in a
lesson......
I asked Andrew and he said we seem to be topping out at 12 megs?
Thanks for looking into this and letting me know
Lesley

"","","Pop up window still not appearing","Hi All,

This is still an ongoing problem.
We have 2 seperate classess which have a problem sending their registers to
the database.
the other classess have never had a problem. The reception class has had
this problem for months and the year 5/6 class has only had this issue
since half term (one and a half weeks).

When the teacher closes the browser down and opens it up again, does the
register and saves, the box to click ""ok"" usually appears. But if the
teacher then takes the afternoon register in the same way, the box to click
""ok"" seems to appear about 50% of the time.

Let me know if I can answer any more questions.

I'm finding my laptop incredibly slow and it needs restarting constantly.
This week one of my USB ports has given out, so it no longer recognises my
visualiser when I plug it in, which has meant that I have to disconnect my
mouse if I want to use the visualiser which I do often, probably with at
least one class a day.

I'm not sure if it's a long shot, but do you have any devices available

To: l.brett@nsj.hslt.academy <l.brett@nsj.hslt.academy>


Hi Elisabeth,


I have taken a look into the imports for you and it looks like we have
temporarily paused them due to some changes on the server at your school
that has Groupcall Xporter installed, the program that transfers MIS data
to CPOMS. We do this to safeguard the data held in CPOMS until we can
verify the changes that have occurred.


Specifically this appears to be a change in server name detailed below:


Old server: NSJ-SIMS01

New server: NSJ-ADMIN01


Are you/IT able to confirm that this is simply a new MIS server, as opposed
to a rebuild of SIMS data, and that the details above are correct?


Kind Regards

Kelvin McLean

I'm encountering difficulties logging in to my account with Evolve, which

The password has been reset several time including by York City council and
I still cannot access it. They can log in to my account on their computers
so the account is fine.

I've tried clearing my cache as this worked previously, but it isn;t
anymore.

Can you think of any reason why it may be failing? When I put the password
in and submit it seems to just reset the page. It dosen't say that the
password is incorrect.

I have tried logging in from several different computers around school.

"","","Specialist sound and music equipment","Dear Vital,

Please can I ask you not to unplug or reconfigure any of our music and
sound equipment in P5 (in addition to P4).

There has been a situation this afternoon where one of my team has been
unable to deliver his lesson as needed as the speakers had been unplugged
and not reconnected properly. If P5 is used for cover lessons, the mac
speaker system we use for our lessons cannot be used as it requires the
wiring with the additional interface. The placement of these speakers is
also very precise for how we use them and they are easily damaged if not
used well (£1200 each to replace them). For cover lessons, if video
playback is needed, the smart TV speakers should be used.

I've fixed the system and retested it.

Many thanks

Dave

"","","Plagiourism","Hi I have an issue with 2 students actual BTEC Sport work being identical.
I believe Archie Burley has copied Nicola Rodwells work on a piece of
coursework in their classroom. They had a prep document and then the actual
assignment. The prep document is called Warm-up for Colin the cyclist and
the actual assignment is called Task 3 actual assignment - Component 1.
They are both in my and their classroom 10A/Sp1 under a file called
Component 1 : Task 3.

Nicola is convinced he has hacked her account and copied her work. We can
see the history on each of their documents of when they have been edited
but am wondering if you are able to see if they have had any email
interactions? It looks like a lot of his copied work into his prep document
was done on 19th January.
My question to you is A) Can you see if there was email interaction by the
2 at any point?
B) Does he have a document saved anywhere of her work? This maybe tricky to
see. I doubt Archie logs in that regularly as he isn’t great at doing any
work out of school.
 C) There is a section in red on Archie’s actual assignment - this is from
Nicola’s assignment on her resubmission. They have to write in red font any
additions for ease of marking.  Archie missed the first submission due to
absence and so was never asked to write in red! Can this be traced?
D) Just any other info would be great
Thanks in advance

It keeps giving me the message “contact your domain admin for help” Please

Hi,

I've got a new phone and need to get it connected to the New Earswick wifi so I can get my emails and 2 factor authenticator set up.

Can you email the wifi login as nobody seems to know it?

We have a visually impaired pupil at the Junior school who needs to have a
book on his iPad for this week. The iPad was purchased through Vital and
paid for by the East Riding Sensory Team on his behalf. The book he
requires can be bought from Amazon, the Kindle edition, but I just
wanted to query if that can be done by me and that it could be downloaded
and added to the iPad by us in school or is this something that Vital has
to do?

Re *Limited stocks of reconditioned Chromebooks,* three years old, are
available for purchase from Vital at £60-70 including licence each (new

Can you let me know if these are still available - potentially if we could
get the PTFA to give us the money to purchase these we would be looking at

Janet Parkinson, one of our employees cannot access her emails as when she

Hi Yvonne,

Rachel and I briefly caught up about this tonight.

The main purpose for these Ipads was to allow our children to access
virtual stories in the reading areas via the QR scanner.

There are a lot of features on the IPADs which we wouldn't want our
children to click on / they would need.

Bar the below, are we able to wipe/ hide all the apps and features bar the
ones listed here for nursery please?

On main page:

   - QR code scanner
   - Camera


Other apps to add (I would need to double check these when they are loaded
but I have found some other apps that might help learning in other areas):

   - Play 1,2,3
   - Sand draw
   - Glow draw
   - Doodle Buddy
   - Bee-Bot
   - Singing fingers
   - The wheels on the bus


I currently have one new Ipad in the nursery. I can return this for this to
happen along with other new ones for nursery.

Please could you let me know if this is possible.

Thanks,
Jen

This is just to follow up from our conversation regarding the teaching
school hub conference room and office being painted over the half term
holidays.

I'm not sure if any of the computers etc will be being unplugged but the
site team are aware and will be moving furniture etc.

If someone could be on hand the first thing on the first day back after
half term (Monday 19th Feb) that would be great as we have a Conference so
we'll need to make sure everything is back to normal.

Thanks.

Please can you see how I would be having all these issues using my laptop at home. I never had any issues like this before and it is stopping me from doing my work. This link for Evolve doesn't work https://evolve.edufocus.co.uk/evco10/evchome_public.asp?domain=leedsvisits.org.uk and won't let me use it. When I use SharePoint, I have to refresh every page once both I can view it so as you can imagine that would waste a lot of time.

Linda did say before there were loads of issues with SharePoint or it not working which I could never understand but as I've got Linda's old laptop it must be something to do with the settings I'm guessing.

Also the laptop I have the caps lock light never goes off. Not a big issue but again an issue with a laptop.

Please can you also update me on the Chromebooks you have got that you are repairing and when they will be due back to school.

As discussed a moment ago on the phone, we had a bit of a 'mare in y3 last
week and this! The first 20 or so Chromebooks to log on were fine, but then
it got increasingly complicated - reporting network not available or giving
errors on sign in. Feels *very* much like insufficient bandwidth - devices
were reporting strong signal.

Please could some take a look and give it a poke/kick/threaten it with a
hammer as necessary?

Let me know if you need the access point number - I can ask a teacher to go
take a snap of it, as I'm not on site now.

"","","Redundant trolley and laptops","Hi Lee,

At the back of the drama classroom we have a redundant laptop trolley with
around 7 laptops in which I believe haven't been updated since the IT
issue. Please can the trolley and laptops be removed?

If possible, we could do with a couple of the laptops to run audacity for
student use, as this doesn't work on the chromebooks but we certainly don't
need a trolley full.

Thanks,
Alethea

"","","Re: DT6 password suggestion","Good morning Jimmy,

We have a group of students in Year 7 who have a range of challenges,
however a common thread amongst them is organisation and memory.

As you will see from Ed's email, this presents difficulties when trying to
access anything that requires a password and username.

Would it be possible, if we identify these children to you, to change their
login details to something simple to remember or for you to share said
children's login details with myself or me to store and give to staff as an
when they can't access technology?

Thanks very much

Rob

Multi Factor Authentication for Edexcel Online

Dear Colleague,

We have introduced our new app-based multi-factor authentication (MFA) for
all users of Edexcel Online. This will replace our current email-based MFA .
*The app is now live and will become mandatory to access Edexcel Online via
the Pearson Portal on the 5 December 2023. You will need to download the
Pearson authenticator app to a smart device (such as a smart phone) to
continue to access Edexcel online via the Pearson Portal. *


This follows on from the communications we sent to *head of centres*
