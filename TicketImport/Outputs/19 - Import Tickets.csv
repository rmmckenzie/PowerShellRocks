Hi Jo,

 

This is just to let you know that I seem no longer to be able to access emails from Vale using the academy email address. I don’t know if any have been sent recently, but I just cannot see anything at all from Vale. I’m obviously concerned about this because I would like to play a full role as governor and feel at the moment that I am not sure what is going on. Any help would be very welcome!

 

Very best wishes,


Paul

Second as we discussed last week would it be okay to give me Anna's
password for the windows system so that I can give it to her on Thursday,
It will (hopefully) reduce the level of anxiety that she is currently
experiencing as she is worried that she won't be able to get on when she
comes back in.

"","","Photos","Hi,

I'm after a bit of Google Drive advice. Currently trying to download and
print photos from our new iPads but not able to do so with individually
adding photos to another document such as Google Slides.

There isn't the option to print in Google Drive - and when I try to open
the files through Windows Explorer, they won't display. I just get this
message...

[image: image.png]

At first I tried using a non-live photo on the iPad to see if that was an
issue, but to no avail.

Do you have any guidance on this?

I was under the impression that we ought to be able to print directly from
the iPads, but it can't locate any printers.

Simon

"","","Laptop to screen link","Hello

What cable do I need to extend my laptop to the screen which is on my desk
at the Offices?

There isn't anything there at the moment (apart from a screen on an arm) -
I don't need a mouse or keyboard as I type directly to the laptop and take
my own mouse with me when I work from the offices.

Thanks, Caren

Hi Tim,

Hope you had a good weekend.

A lady just called trying to get in touch with someone for a job advert she
saw for Tadcaster. She used our main line and used option 2 then 2 again
which brought her to a voicemail in german. Your voice was on the main line
and I think we are directing all vital queries to you. Could you change the
voicemail?

I bought a new USB for myself and office staff, and they work when using on
PCs, however when connecting it to the printer for scanning (the main

I have tried formatting, which has not worked. Is there something else we
can do?

We are unable to scan from the printer to a drive or to emails so we need
to be able to use the memory sticks ideally.

Hi

I hope you’re well.

Oliver collected his iPad earlier tonight - we were in the process of
setting it up but he ended up being locked out and we can’t now get the
passcode to work. It looks like he will need to completely reboot the iPad
connected to a laptop - really sorry about this as I know he needs it in
the morning (he’s got himself a bit upset about it tonight saying he’ll get
into trouble!) Would it be ok for someone in IT to look at it for him
tomorrow?

Again, apologies for this, hopefully it can be sorted in the morning.

Many thanks

"","","Smoothwall issues URGENT","Good morning,

PSHE teachers across all year groups are advising that they cannot access
many of the lessons due to the new Smoothwall.

This is unacceptable, the teachers must be able to access the lessons - the
lessons will contain reference to drugs, body modification, suicide,
harrassment etc but this is becasue they are elements of the PSHE
curriculum and are vital to our safeguarding curriculum.

Please can this be looked into urgently as lessons are due to be taught
from tomorrow.

This is the link to the lessons -PSHE Lessons
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19zboZScH9Ft953w79ol51SyFXWJQTy6P?usp=share_link>

This must be permanently resolved as a matter of urgency, please let me
know if what you need me to do to help this get resolved.

"","","St George's York - font query","Hello Vital,

Kevin Atkinson in Y3 has recently got a new PC at home. He has asked if he
can get the font that the school bought and uses as standard so that he can
lesson/resource prep etc at home on this (their licensing for the font
should cover this).

There used to be a copy of this in the CD Roms on the server, from memory,
but of course I can't access that from off site, and neither can he.

Would it be possible to put a copy of this on the GDrive somewhere that we
can access it? He says he thinks it is called ""XCCW Joined 1a"" - from
memory there was a suite of fonts (including bold, outline, dotted etc) all
in the same folder although I have to say it is quite a while since anyone
has asked me, so that memory is a bit hazy. If you are able to find them on
their server and send me them or stick them all on the STGY staff shared
GDrive and let me know where, that would be phenomenally helpful.

Thank you!
Kat

Three things as Y12 start practical work:


  1.  Is it possible to unblock access to Youtube for the Y12 Media students please?
  2.  They will also need Canva from Monday - there shouldn't be any issues there, should there?
  3.  Finally, it wasn't possible to use Wix on the Macs today (even when they tried going through the school website). Is there anything that can be done there, please?



Thanks for all,

"","","Smooth wall issues","Hi,

I am trying to plan the PSHE curriculum and the smooth wall keeps blocking
me from accessing my own lessons on things like drug awareness, body
modification etc.
This is incredibly frustrating as these things are all in the PSHE
curriculum and I need to address them. I understand we need a sensitive
smoothwall but this is hindering my ability to plan the curriculum.
I am also concerned that teachers will not be able to access these lessons
when they need to if the smoothwall decides they are problematic.

Can this be looked into?

"","","Plug issue with LMG mic","Hi Ben,

Lauren has reported that her mic, amp and speakers were turning off during
lessons today.

This problem was solved when students pushed the extension plug back into
the socket.  However, the plug was not unplugged from the socket which
would suggest that their is an issue either with the socket or the
extension cord plug.

Would we be able to troubleshoot this by using a different extension lead?

Thank you,

Adam

As discussed with James, I have put Michelle's start date to tomorrow (24th) on SIMS, so that the log-ins can be generated overnight and Claire can complete her log-ins.

I will amend the start date on SIMS to reflect the real date later next week, as I presume that then won't cause problems.

As discussed with James, I have put Michelle's start date to tomorrow (24th) on SIMS, so that the log-ins can be generated overnight and Claire can complete her log-ins.

I will amend the start date on SIMS to reflect the real date later next week, as I presume that then won't cause problems.

Thanks both,

is it possible to make the default printer the black and white one rather
than
the colour one to save on printing costs ?

We use printix.

Also a teacher was asking if it would be possible for staff to use codes
to release prints (currently they just print and the job comes straight
out).
As we don't have a print server not sure if  printix supports releasing
prints
with codes ? This is only a request to know if it possible, the head would
need to
approve it first.

We have one printer / MFD from agilico Sharp MX-4061

Hi Ronnie

Unless Claire knows any different you would need a PDF Writer to adapt the form you have sent (and school doesn't have one). I would normally just print it, complete and re-scan.

Claire - would you do anything different?

Hi Ronnie,
It was lovely speaking to you,
Please find attached an order form for 50 credits along with a customer information form, both need completing and returning to myself, along with a Purchase Order number should you need one, the customer information form would need your contact details and any other colleagues you would like to have access to the account.

Could somebody please come out and have a look at our year 5 teacher's PC.
The problem has been reported before and the PC has since been replaced but
the PC itself keeps crashing and needing rebooting. This is becoming more
frequent and is now happening 2/3 times a week.

We also had an engineer out to set up the PC and board in the year 6
intervention room to enable us to use this as a working classroom. We were
told that an adapter was needed and that he would return to complete the
job. This is yet to be done so I was wondering if it is possible for this
to be carried out on the same visit.

"","","AD account creation","Hi,

It appears that Edulife may not be creating AD Accounts?

Milena Williams has a google account but does not have an AD account.

I also have 2 students who started after Xmas who also don't have AD
accounts? I've checked in the account reset tool and on Edulink's LDAP page
and neither students or Milena appear.

Please can this be looked into?

At the moment, Milena has no internet access on her chromebook as there is
no way to authenticate against the smoothwall.

Many thanks,

   1. The website does not seem to be an official government one.  This has
   also been blocked since 08:57 AM today
   2. It looks like the student e-mailed from a mobile device as per the

I am currently using my desktop computer for work and have to connect a

busy or out of ink, it would be useful for me to use the one in my office.

It was this account that printed:

[image: image.png]

We can see in Kieran's emails that he received a message from Kayden
Grabham's personal Gmail at 11.54 with the image that was printed.

Kevin is just asking our broadband provider to check the logs to ensure
this content didn't pass through school filters but the likelihood is it
was accessed on Kayden's phone and sent via JPEG to Kieran.

Thanks
Sam

On my desktop I have a shortcut to the Integris system for York and North

disappeared.  Please can you tell me how I can get it back.

Also, can you tell me what is happening with the Remote Desktop.  I know a
ticket has been raised (ref. T20230210.0085) by Lara Pearson and an email
address link has been provided.  Are there any plans to update the remote

It's still saying NOVA is running even though I'm not running it. Angela,
have you been able to get on it?

Hi all,

Unfortunately, the printer has jammed at least three times today and we
have been fanning the paper. The last jam happened about an hour ago and is
completely stuck so the printer is currently out of action. Can someone
please come to have a look at it asap?

Team English, I have just printed one copy to maths (printer 4) and then
gone down to the photocopier in the office to print out a full class set.
It looked like the Maths printer may have jammed today (due to some
scrunched up paper by the side) so I didn't want to overload it.

Kind regards,

Natalie

A teacher previously requested installation of the Crumble App, however, she had found it for a child in her class (year 5 LDS/ LE) and thought it was ok, but it doesn't seem to be on any other accounts, and it is Year 3 who apparently really need it right now.

She has also asked if it could please be added to the teacher's network applications. As the year 3 teacher needs it asap (Year 3 Mr Cole)

Please can this be sorted as a matter of urgency?

Links for the app are:
For Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crumble/bnhpbkockjdlpabghffolflefoekodob

For Windows: https://redfernelectronics.co.uk/crumble-software/

Really sorry, more time would have been preferably but i have only just seen the email from the teacher

Subject: ACTION: PC and Projector request in po2 and po3?

Hi Jonathan

I have had a few conversations with James about the computer and projector provision within the Drama department.

The laptops in both PO2 and po3 are causing problems with my team's day to day teaching as the laptops are proving to be pretty unpredictable. eg. when they turn on - sometimes class charts is missing or SIMs, or this morning the printer didn't link up.
From speaking with James a PC would hopefully prevent these unexpected issues from happening.

Also the projector that the Drama department bought many years ago is not great. It regularly freezes and the projection onto the wall is so faint we have to turn out the lights every time we want to use it.

Therefore please can I formally request that both laptops in po2 and po3 get replaced for pcs ( James informs me they are due to be replaced soon). Also can I request a new projector that can still be projected onto the large white wall in po2 only with a brighter image and one that is more predictable.

As a focus to develop our Drama provision for our VL students we are working hard to improve our use of PPT's within our lessons and so this will really help with this departmental development focus.

Any more information that you need, please let me know
Many thanks
Beth

Thank you.

Westfield Primary School have recently paid to update PWW's iPad as it was no longer supported (I believe). She is in Year 5.

School have requested some apps be added to her iPad:

  *   SeeingAI
  *   PrizmoGo
  *   SnapType
  *   Dolphin EasyReader
(They are all the free versions)

Please can you let me and Gill know when this has been done as Gill is working with the student and her TA to develop the use of her iPad.

"","","Paxton Fob Access","Hi

My colleague Debbie Delaney got in touch with you in October 2022 re the
Paxton Fob Access that wasn't working in school to see if you could help
with problems we were having. We were unable to programme new fobs as two
of the access points weren't working. Despite a few phone calls with Paxton
and yourselves we ended up having to have engineers on site from Elementary
Technology to solve the problem, at a cost of £375+VAT as we were told it
was too technical and specialist engineers were needed.

When the engineers arrived they could see straight away that on 22
September 2022, two patch leads had been removed from network points Z22
and Z28. Once they had replaced the leads the fobs started working straight
away.

I can see from our Inventry report that one of your engineers did work in
school on that day. Please can we make sure this doesn't happen again as
this has cost school highly for replacing two leads!

Thank you.

Tracey

Dear school staff,

This morning I phoned school and I was kindly assisted to try to get access
to Classroom Chart  for Iñaki's (11Wb) notifications. I have the app, I've
been using it for Iker (8Er) and I'm embarrassed to say I didn't know class
chart was also for Y11.  I'm trying to add Iñaki, but after several
attempts, I keep getting a message about an error.

Could you help me with this?

Thank you for your time.

"","","Sixth Form secure release printing","Staff would like to implement Sixth Form students having to log in to MFDs (mainly regarding the main library printer) with a PIN, the same way that staff do.

Apparently there's been too many times that students have sent something to print and then never been to collect it.

I've tried my best to have a go on Papercut/AD to sort this out but it seems that there is something I've missed or not done right.

To clarify here is what I've done so far.

In AD:
Created a Universal Security Group called ""PaperCut-Sixth Form Student"" in the Papercut OU within 'groups'
Created a Universal Security Group called ""all.sixth form student printing"" in the Misc Groups OU within 'groups'
Added all.16 and all.17 (current sixth form students) into ""all.sixth for student printing""
Added ""all.sixth form student printing"" to the ""PaperCut-Sixth Form Student"" group
On PaperCut:
Added the ""all.sixth form student printing"" into the 'Groups' section
Added the ""PaperCut-Sixth Form Student"" into the 'Groups' section
Created a new Account called ""Sixth Form Student""
Within the ""Sixth Form Student"" Account in the security section, I added ""PaperCut-Sixth Form Student"" group
Changed the settings within the ""all.sixth form student printing"" to match the settings for ""all.staff"" to be able to select a shared account and to charge to a shared account.
When running a test on the account 21studvi which is in the group 'all.16' the virtual print queues don't appear like I thought they might do.

Are you able to take a quick look and see if you could potentially help please?

Hi Jackie
I am having a problem with my laptop the HDMI socket is not working properly, my laptop keeps going off so will not show on the whiteboard all the time.  It has been like it for a bit and I have managed so far to sort it using bluetac (sorry know this is not the correct way to do it, needs must) but its very hit and miss.  Can I ask who I need to speak to, to sort it out.
Thanks

"","","English Printer Access Issue","Morning Ben,

We have a new printer problem that we need some help with.

During most of the last half term we could access the printer in the
English workroom from the desktop computers in our workroom and our
classrooms.

However, during the last week or so, the English printer has disappeared as
an option from our English computers.  Strangely, we can still see other
printers, such as the Maths and Humanities printer.

Do you have any idea why this might be and is there any way this issue can
be solved?

Thanks,

Adam

Id though like to block the shorts section of youtube, as it seems to have nothing of any educational value on it, but I cant find a way of doing it. Is there a way?

Also, I tried adding a specific video URL to the youtube blocked videos category on our smoothwall, and it has made no difference. Could you please check that this category is applying to all students

"","","Missing charging cable for monitor in training room","From Jane Lovejoy <j.lovejoy@ebor.academy>: Morning,

We are missing the charging cable for the monitor in the training room at
the Leyes Business and Training Centre - I think someone mistakenly took it
thinking it was their laptop charger, but unfortunately, nobody has
returned the charger and so we've been using a laptop charger in the office
which nobody seems to be using on a regular basis.

We're mindful that using the laptop charger in the office is not a long
term solution and so we were wondering if you could provide us with another
charger please? If so, would we need to pay for this? Also, is there any
way to lock the charger to the monitor to prevent it being
accidentally taken again?

I've attached some photos below of the monitor / charger entry point for
your reference.

Hi Mark

Are you aware of this? I received one from her yesterday about a court
order and replied asking for more information so we can investigate.

It has raised suspicions as I don’t know anything about it, the content of
the email sounds odd and when I just clicked ‘reply’ to this one it came up
with a strange email address for you. I’ve selected ‘Forward’ and entered
your email address manually.

Thanks
Mike

Hello Michael,

I have just received a follow up email from Kirstie, a lawyer from Taylor
Wessing LLP representing a firm we worked with last year regarding a late
bill issued to us for the amount of £39,328.46 and I asked her to contact
you regarding this but she kept coming back to me. She is threatening with
legal action if this is not paid today. I am aware of this invoice as I
assigned their client to negotiate a contract on our behalf.

Attached you will find a copy of the due invoice for the services rendered.
Please see below email from Kirstie and I understand the invoice was sent
before but it was not entered into the system for payment. Can we pay this
today to prevent a lawsuit against us?

Kind Regards,
*Mark Hassack*

Good morning Mark,

I have sent the invoice again to you as a reminder. I wish to inform you
that this invoice is overdue with no justified reason from you and as such
we request payment of the overdue invoice today. Failure to make payment
for the overdue invoice will leave us no alternative but to bring legal
action against your company.

I have opened a PowerPoint on the remote desktop as a slide show and it has

I have opened up a second desktop, so I can do some work, but PowerPoint
will not open on this second desktop at all, so I am a bit stuck.

If there is anything you can do, this would be much appreciated.

We have identified that some plugs in our server cabinets have not been
Portable Appliance Tested since Nov 2017.   Our site manager has completed
testing but one of the plugs has failed.  We believe that this is due to
this being an extension cable that is coiled up inside the cabinet.  Due to
the location of the plugs we are unable to uncoil the cable and require
support from someone at Vital to achieve this as we may need to
disturb some of the equipment inside the cabinet.

Could someone please add Microsoft Office and Activinspire to the supply
laptops held in the OLQM office? Louise Haritakis left her old one and it

"","","Remote Desktop","Hi Kev,

I am struggling to get onto the remote desktop. I have been using it fine
this morning, but now it has lost connection, and says that it can't
reconnect. About ten minutes prior to it losing connection it also said
that the remote desktop license had been reviewed and I would only have 60
minutes before it logged me off.

Just checking to see if there is anything amiss, or whether I just need to
try again in a little bit.

Many thanks,
Sally

"","","Remote Access not Working - Expired Certificate?","Hello Vital. Hope you are having a good half term.

The SSL certificate for remote.allsaints.york.sch.uk has expired.

You can bypass the warning for the webclient but it doesn't connect anyway
as it complains about an unexpected certificate. (as shown below).

Note the certificate for remote access service and the webclient website
don't seem to be the same.. not sure if that is normal or not???

Can we renew this certificate?.. Can we use LetsEncrypt? If not then I can
raise a PO if required. Let me know how much.

Charles.

We've found these accounts on one of our MFA CSV files that was sent

however for some reason they're duplicated? So majority of these accounts
are new staff, however they're duplicated on Sam Willsden's list with
their @ahs.pmat.academy email and have MFA set up.

Please could you confirm that the accounts on the attached list are
duplicates, and if so can be suspended, and why duplicates have been

Hi Gill,
has something changed with logging into shared areas from home?
I have always been able to get in from old pre covid link. That has stopped
working this morning and I looked up the new link that you sent earlier in
January and that just displays an empty screen when I log in. I have some
work to do today so am going to come into school but I often access the
system from home in the evening etc. Help!!

I was just wondering if there is something I need to do to the laptop in PO3 as it won't let me run things (like teams) and is being a bit temperamental. It keeps saying not enough disk space - free up some disk space.

Thanks

has been approved.

I believe that we would now just need your DBS checks to come through
before you can attend a meeting. I will double check with Lauren in the
Central Team to confirm that your email address is still live (let me know
if you have any issues accessing this) for accessing Decision Time.

Toby, please can you start (if you haven’t already) the DBS and ID checks.

Good evening Toby, Patrick and Louise

I trust that you are all well and had a relaxing break.

I haven’t heard anything back regarding the Trust appointed governor role,
although I suspect this is a combination of my parent governor role ceasing
and my email (voy.hslt address) no longer working, the later could be due
to the recent cyber attach.

Could I ask that any correspondence is via my hi.its.mrt@gmail.com address
please.

Kind regards,

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for sending this through so quickly.

I’ve spoken to Tony and I’ll get this added on their next agenda,
unfortunately as your Parent Governor term has now officially ended you
cannot perform any governor related tasks until the Board approve you as a
Trust Appointed governor at their next meeting.

Their next meeting is before the next Vale LGC so it shouldn’t affect your
attendance there.

If you have any questions, let me know.

I contacted you last week (3rd Feb) regarding issues with my laptop. I have
not heard anything back and today we break up for half term. I was told a
member of your team would be in, however they haven't.

I am still having issues with my keyboard and screen turning off when I am
trying to do something. This has been happening since September. Although
it has been on and off, no one else in the school is having this problem. I
also cannot connect my visualiser, again I am the only member of staff that
cannot do this. Swapping laptops with other teachers so I can teach a
lesson using the visualiser is not a long term solution.

I look forward to hearing from you

Sophie.

"","","New Ticket - 09/02/2023 10:03","Hi,
We had a corrupted shortcut to our planning folder late last week. I
attempted to creat a new shortcut but ended up replicating it by accident.
Yesterday, I checked all team’s folders and thought I’d copied all items
that had been created/edited back over but, in the process, deleted our
trainee teacher’s work!

It WAS in the Planning 2022-23 (one of them) > UKS2 > Literacy > Spring ii
> Narrative.

There were up to four Activ Primary IWB resources and I’m afraid I can’t be
certain of their names but they were created/last edited by miss d.maisto
over the course of the last week.

Thank you so much - mortified and clearly can’t be trusted!

"","","Controlled assessment tech","Hi

For our Criminology course students have to sit a controlled assessment over an 8 hour period using computers. I was wondering how best we can facilitate the requirements of this using our current computer rooms or laptops.


My current plan is for students to sit their controlled assessment in January. This will be a total of 35 sixth form students.
If we use lesson time to do this, it will be one class of 20 and one class of 15


  *   The first 3 hours require students to complete tasks without access to the internet.
  *   The remaining 5 hours allow internet access.
  *   Students are not able to access their work in between sessions (so we can't get them to save their work to teams or their normal account)
  *   We mark the work then upload the documents of selected students for moderation to the exam board.

Just wondered how we can do this? I am thinking we create exam accounts for the students and they save their work there?

Also, would this be something more suited for the laptop/chromebooks or actual computer rooms.

Many thanks

David

"","","Re: Printer jamming","Hi Natalie

Thanks for your email.

I can appreciate how frustrating and inconvenient these continuing issues
with the printer are, and I think things have got to the stage where
repeated engineer visits are not helping; and I believe Ben feels the same
way.

Unfortunately, our contract with Kyocera is due to finish soon, and
because they are not sure if we are going to renew that contract (I will
have to speak to our Procurement Officer at the Trust), they won't install
new devices.

Ben has put a call out for an engineer to attend to the English printer as
soon as possible.

Sorry it's not better news, but our hands are tied at the moment.

Rachael

"","","Account access and resources","Good Morning,

My name is Will Wrathall, I started as a science teacher at the start of
this term.
Given the ongoing IT issues, I have been unable to access important
resources, which is completely understandable, such as briefing updates as
they do not get sent to this email address.

I understand that some services are now available and so I am contacting
you in hopes that I can be provided a permanent email address and gain
access to resources that I currently don't have access to.

These include access to:
Edulink
Behaviour Logging
Registers
On-Call

and access to appropriate mailing lists:
General
Science Department
Tutor Resources (Yr 9)

If there is anything I need to do, or if some of these requests should be
directed at someone else, please let me know.

I hope you can help! Thanks!
Kind regards, Will.

"","","Internet issues today - reassurance required","Good afternoon

Following the issues that we had yesterday and this morning I am concerned
that the temporary fix completed by Johnny (apologies if I have got the
name wrong) will mean that we could find ourselves in the same position in
the morning.

He mentioned that Vital knows what the issue is and is hoping to fix it
today but as he has signed staff into the hidden network manually their
computers will not reconnect to this in the morning.  This obviously won't
be an issue if everything is up and running but I need assurance that there
is a back up plan in place.  The school cannot have another morning without
connectivity as this has a significant impact not only on teaching and
learning but also on our ability to complete our registers (a safeguarding
concern) and do simple things like order lunches for the children.

Could you please provide me with an update on the fix as soon as possible
but no later than 4pm?

Many thanks
Jo

Computer 6M82DD2 : Service Tag
Express Service Code : 14404497446

When logging in as Julie Coulter-Bell and other users, the whole computer
is laggy, the mouse moves all over the place, typing is slow and then
suddenly appears afew seconds laters.

Also, the sound has been played with when logging into these accounts and
now only comes out of the actual computer rather than the big monitor that
it is attached too, this all moves on wheels and goes around the school, it
usually lives in Class 19, Paula Wilkinsons' room. In the sound settings
there is no option to connect the sound to the HDMI/TV Screen.

However, when logging in as a guest account the sound comes out of the
front of the monitor.

Hi Clare,


I can confirm that you have been booked in for a site visit on* 23/02/2023.*

Your engineer is called *Jordan Ellis* and will arrive at site between 09:30
 and 11:30.



Please could you make sure that everything is in place ready for the
engineer to complete the site visit and a member of your IT support team is
available, either onsite or remotely, for our engineer's visit. If any
issues arise which are outside of our control (including IT related issues)
which prevent our engineer from completing the visit within the allotted
timeframe, a chargeable revisit may be required.

Please note, you will require an RJ45 network socket in the location of
where your QuickScan unit(s) will be installed. The cable supplied will run
up to a maximum of 5 metres in length from the installation location. The
QuickScan is a PoE device which will need patching into a PoE network
switch. If there is no PoE switch available, InVentry will provide a PoE
injector for this purpose and the PoE injector will require a power socket
in the switch cabinet.

Please review the* QuickScan location/mounting options here
<https://inventry.co.uk/location-and-mounting-options/#:~:text=1x%20Power%20Socket.-,Quickscan%20Device,-**For%20both%20Indoor>,*

this provides important information about what needs to be in place prior
to installation.

If you require our engineer to take a Lateral Flow Test on the day of your
site visit, please make us aware of this prior to the visit.

have access to the staff folder on google drive so that she can access the

Friday when MFA is rolled out.

Following on from 'Cyber attack friday' the admin team are high alert for
suspicious emails, Michelle has just mentioned that she has just had the
same email from a company called sporting dreams come into the inbox on the

"","","Internet Access S11","Hi Ben,
I am aware this may be a general issue but just in case it wasn't I wanted
to raise it with you.

My PC has been running shockingly for the past 2 days, with really slow
processing and connectivity issues. Sometimes, whilst using it, the screen
goes blank and has to wait until it's buffered and it takes about 2 mins to
get logged in to CPOMs, then further delayed time to navigate through the
tabs.

Last night for Parents Eve I had to keep refreshing it as it would not
connect mic and camera imagery to calls, and in the end had to go on to my
ipad - which worked better but not great.

As above I know we are having general issues, but am aware some
people aren't having this much of an issue as I am, so just wanted to
check.
Thanks
Hollie

I am moving sites today to Wingfield, there Is no laptops at the Wingfield
site. The hp and dell laptops we were using before the IT nightmare began

Can these be used now?
I will need them on the Monday we return after half term. The printer that

"","","15 Chromebooks to transfer","We have a spare 15 chromebooks at Robert Wilkinson Primary that are not in
use and we would like to move them to Staynor Hall.  I would like them to
be checked before they are transferred to make sure they are all working
properly (no reason to think they are not) and wiped of any data on them.
I also think you keep a log on them for us and when the licences expire so
they would need transferring in your records.

Could you arrange for someone to pick them up, make sure they are all ok
and then set up at Staynor Hall.  There is also a charging trolley to
transfer with them.

I don't know if there would be an additional charge for this but if there
is please get in touch and I will get a PO created.

Hi Vivienne
I just wanted to finish the week by saying thank you. The way you have
handled the whole situation has been exactly what you would want from a
Chair both in terms of consultation with the trust prior to the complaint
and supporting your HT throughout.

I think Chairs at Ebor, and you in particular, are truly amazing for all
the time and expertise you provide for your schools. Your LGB and school
are really lucky to have you.

I realise the meeting was quite formal this week but you articulated
everything you needed to. It will have been quite a day having the LGB
straight after, I hope you get a well deserved break this weekend.

Wendy

"","","HSLT Central team member setup initially at merger as asa in error - issue accessing HSLT remote after ASA reboot today 07.02.2023","Good Morning Vital Support

I am a HSLT central team member but am based in the hull central office and
my logins are set in error to be linked to ASA and not the central team
automatically I believe (even though my email and login is
j.kirkham@hslt.academy) and so I appear to be affected when any reboot
occurs at ASA.

We have been given access as the central team to remote working in order
for us to access the accounting system PSF (remote.halt.academy) as of the
wednesday of last week by Simon Bryan Smith .

I have been able to access this no issues until Callum onsite at ASA
(vital) rebooted ASA due to an issue with the wifi here.

I am now getting the following error message and cannot access the remote
access - my colleagues who are set correctly as central are having no
issues.  I have also tried to access via my work phone hotspot in case was
issue with the wifi and this comes up with the same error message.  I have
also tried rebooting prior to me sending this query.

[image: image.png]
Please can someone help me as I think my setting needs amending again
from ASA back to Central?

NB just FYI as I am on a chromebook I an unable to allow teamviewer login
for vital

Thanks for your time and assistance

Hi Steph,

I know this will have already been asked but would it be possible to get in
touch with Vitl to ask about setting up classroom visualisers? I imagine it
wasn't a priority when we first came back because of all the other cyber
issues!

Many thanks,

I have a bit of an odd request and I'm not sure if it is something that you
can help with.

We are currently investigating an unusual transaction on our credit card
but hte credit card company has told us that they are unwilling to do
anything as the transaction occurred via the same IP address as a lot of
our other transactions.

We know the IP address 80.94.201.42 and the date/time of the transaction
16/1/2023 @ 14:22 and I'm wondering if Vital have any way of looking at the
activity on that computer around that time?

I realise it's a long shot but I need to ask the question.

Hi James,

It doesn't look like the ITT student email addresses have been generated.

James can you do this manually, so I can do Sims and ClassCharts logins please.

Susan - can you look at the set up in Sims to try to work out what is missing.  Perhaps compare them to a previous ITT student?

Thanks,

CRM:00668133
To: Babs Tunley <b.tunley@ebor.academy>


Hi Babs,


I can confirm that you have been booked in for a site visit on* 16/02/2023.*

Your engineer is called *Matthew Jarrett* and will arrive at site between
08:30 and  09:00.



Please could you make sure that everything is in place ready for the
engineer to complete the site visit and a member of your IT support team is
available for our engineer's visit. If any issues arise which are outside
of our control (including IT related issues) which prevent our engineer
from completing the visit within the allotted timeframe, a chargeable
revisit may be required.

Please note, you will require an RJ45 network socket in the location of
where your QuickScan unit(s) will be installed. The cable supplied will run
up to a maximum of 5 metres in length from the installation location. The
QuickScan is a PoE device which will need patching into a PoE network
switch. If there is no PoE switch available, InVentry will provide a PoE
injector for this purpose and the PoE injector will require a power socket
in the switch cabinet.

Please review the* QuickScan location/mounting options here
<https://inventry.co.uk/location-and-mounting-options/#:~:text=1x%20Power%20Socket.-,Quickscan%20Device,-**For%20both%20Indoor>,*
as
this provides important information about what needs to be in place prior
to installation.

If you require our engineer to take a Lateral Flow Test on the day of your
site visit, please make us aware of this prior to the visit.

Kind regards

Hello Julie



I hope you and your team are well.



I have been informed by our Data Comms team the equipment has now arrived
in stock so they would like to visit to connect your new circuit to the ER
network.



Would you be able to provide access to your site on 16 February 2023 AM?
The Data Comms engineers will connect the new router and filter server to
your new circuit and switch over from your current connection to the new LS
Hyper.  This will require some downtime for the switch over and testing.
  The downtime usually takes approximately 10 minutes but can take up to an
hour.  We would also ask if your ICT Support provider can be on site at the
same time so they can carry out the configuration changes etc.



Can you please confirm if 16 February 2023 is convenient, if so, can you
please provide your caretaker name and contact information.  If this date
is not convenient, can you please provide some dates so we can make the
arrangements.





Kindest regards





Sue

That is very odd, I know Emily uses Teams all the time in my lessons and at Home, James any ideas? Is there anything different about the set up of Janes French Teams?

Subject: Issues with Teams

Hi Sarah,

I have a couple of Year 10 students, Lola Atkinson and Emily Blunt, who say that they can access all of their subjects on Teams at home except for French! They can access their French Team on the computers in school but not at home.

Is there anything I can do to resolve this?

Thanks,

Jane

HI Lewis.

Thanks for sorting the iPads out. Got them yesterday.

Not sure if this me, but I can’t find the app store on them? There is an Apple Store, but this just takes me to apple products, not to apps?

Am I missing something?

"","","Unable to access online content following Smoothwall update","Hi Callum,

My device has been restarted multiple times since your email on 19th Jan
but I am still having trouble with certain websites and applications.

   1. For example on this page:
   https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/z9prkqt/articles/zfn792p I can
   scroll up and down the info but if I click on any of the interactive
   activities I get a message saying 'this page has been blocked by an
   extension'. This was not the case previously as I have used some of the
   interactive activities (e.g. the synagogue) in lessons before.
   2. I am not able to play GCSE pods in the classroom.
   3. I have been unable to access zoom for work purposes on either my work
   or my personal device. Clicking on the meeting link gets me a blocked
   message or a loading screen that never progresses. I was able to join zoom
   training/meetings previously both on my work device or using the school
   WiFi but this is not longer the case and has caused repeated issues.
   4. This BBC Sounds clip would not play in lesson -
   https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001g8m4 (intention being for pupils
   to listen to Steven Spielberg talk about growing up in a Jewish household).

Sometimes my work gmail comes up as blocked by Smoothwall, or a particular
email does when I've opened it, but this problem usually rectifies itself
so is not a big issue.

Dear all,
we have had our Inventry system upgraded at the Leyes today and as part of
that we were given the old hard drive from the system.  This may be just
because our system had to be replaced as it had failed completely or you
could all have been given this item just in the normal upgrade.

I have attached a picture of the hard drive we were given.  If you have
been handed something like this by the Inventry technician please can you
confirm how you have disposed of it.  There is sensitive data stored on
this hard drive so it needs to be kept secure and destroyed correctly.

You only need to confirm if you or your team have been handed a hard drive.

Regards
Andrew

Dear All

*This is not a task or requirement but an additional CPD opportunity, being
shared as it may be of interest?*

NCFE, our independent assessment organisation and awarding body are
delivering a series of student conferences and next week one specifically
aimed at Education and childcare/EYFS students/apprentices. It is taking
place on Wednesday 8th February between 2-4pm.
It is focussed on '*Seeing the World through a Child's eyes.'*

*Please note: You don't need to watch it then, (I am aware some of you have
a training workshop taking place at the same time) but if you sign up for
it here,
<https://ncfemail.org.uk/ncfelz/lz.aspx?p1=MscDU2NzI0NlMzNzg6MEVDRUVEQjM4NTgyMDhCRkRGQzZGRjAwMEJCQ0NFRTk%3d-&CC=&w=18369>
you
will get the recording to watch at a time that suits you. *

By watching/attending you will get:

   - Insight into the importance of positive relationships in a child’s
   life for holistic, healthy, enabling opportunities that lay the foundation
   for future outcomes
   - A summary of the impact of the physical and relational environment
   against a pedagogical and theoretical framework
   - An opportunity to ask questions to our panel of subject specialists
   and professionals.


*Please see the email below forwarded for any further details.*

Best Wishes

"","","Short cut to the calendar","Hi James

Tom has asked if we can have a short cut to the outlook calendar on our desktops as staff as struggling to locate dates.
I know it is possible to see it in outlook, we have given those instructions out more time that I can count.

I think it is technically possible, could you have a  look at it, so we would have a link to the 2022-23 school calendar in outlook on the desktop.

Also could we look to remove some of the links on the desktop that don't work, there were some last time I looked.

Thanks

Can you please check if the staff passwords have the 2 month update set, as in staff get a password renew message occasionally for improved security.

"","","Laptop not charging","Hi,

My laptop (Sam Dykes - 6D Classroom) is no longer charging.  It was working
perfectly fine yesterday morning however I have come to learn that during
the afternoon lessons, all the cables were pulled out of the Dell and put
into an older PPA laptop, which was placed on top of the DELL laptop.

I tested a new charger however it still didn't charge so I think the
problem is with the actual laptop charging port.

King regards

Subject: FAO VItal help - No google drive on desk top
To: Claire Neal <cneal@dringhouses.co.uk>


Hi Claire,
Please can Vital come in to potentially fix the following...
There is no way to access the Google drive on my laptop other than through
the chrome (9 dots).  I've sent a screen shot to show where it turns up
on everyone elses' computers...
This causes a font change on each slide/doc that anyone opens which is
really difficult to read.  Currently we are changing the font on each slide
etc which is very time consuming!


Also - sadly I am unable to download at home and there is still a problem
when recording with zoom - sorry!

Please can someone come to have a look.

Many Thanks
Clare

"","","URGENT - no internet in Y3","HI,

Please could I raise an urgent call for our Y3 classroom - there is no
internet.

Mr G believes it to be the ethernet connection - he has changed the cable
and internet worked for about 5 minutes then stopped.  He believes it to be
the actual connection point.

The internet has been on and off for several weeks (previous call has been
raised about this) but now it is not working at all.

"","","Re: hi","Hi Richard,

Thank you for your concern

We were made aware of the email last night and have investigated.

The account has been temporarily suspended whilst we speak to the student.
Whilst unusual we don't think this is malicious.

Just for the future Richard, if you do receive an email that you think is
bad please can you send a screenshot and not forward the email itself.

Many thanks
Sam

"","","Wifi details","Hi James

I am trying to collate some information in preparation for the 'OFSTED' call (don't worry we haven't received one, I just want to ensure I am not scrabbling about at the last minute). With this in mind I am creating a 'help' reference sheet which will include how to access the Wifi.  This has always been a bit of a minefield for me - do you have a crib sheet with codes etc etc that I can have? They are likely to be based in the Research school but would also need codes to access Wifi in main school as and when required.

Many thanks

headphones and chromebooks). It will be located in L6 ( sixth form)
This is to be tested prior to the test, as last time the student had
technical issues.
I will confirm the time as soon as we know.

Many Thanks

Just a query regarding the joint files that I have put on One Drive, that we discussed the other day.

I am the only one allowed to amend the main SCR file but if I have it open on my computer for a while then go back to work on it, it has changed to read only, so if I don't notice I make changes then it won't save them.

Is there a setting that I have wrong or is it something I have to live with?

Please could you check which email you have used to add Lucas to your TEAMS?
It appears that there was some problem with his original email in Y7, and he was given a new one. Some teachers have used his old email when setting up their TEAMS and he has therefore been unable to access work set.

the correct email to use is:

Hi Adelle,



Looks like the power switch was turned off at the wall, gave it a test and all seems to be working properly.

Good Afternoon,
Tyler has been unable to complete his work today as unfortunately we are
having issues with the laptop being unable to connect to the Internet for
some reason and I have no idea why!
I have tried all day to fix the issue and to be honest I am at a loss.
Would it be possible to borrow a crome book from school so he can at least
complete his work for the rest of the week?
Thanks

I just wondered if anyone would have a minute to help me access my school emails on my phone please? I can access these without any problem on both my tablet and laptop but on my phone I am being asked for my provider's account details because I have tried to log in unsuccessfully too many times. Obviously not urgent but I am in until 2.10 today and not teaching so if you have time, that would be great.
Many thanks,

Last week I asked our admin team at Sproatley Endowed Academy to email and

The wifi is working without issue in other classrooms around the school,
but is losing signal and not picking up the wifi in my classroom.

The main ethernet link to my desktop works without issue, but my iPad and
chromebooks do not work well in the class.

I would appreciate your assistance with this.

2. The printer in G12 is on the list of working but it states it cannot
connect to the server. Again, students need to use this in their lessons if
possible please? Serial number: 85136767. Sharp MX-5070v

Please can you help. We have our new behaviour and well-being lead

I really need her to have this as it’s preventing her from doing quite a

It was requested several weeks ago by the school. Is there any way if this
can please be escalated and the laptop arranged to be delivered to her asap.

Subject: Missing folders AGAIN

Hi

Sorry but had a call to say two more Yr 11 folders are missing but I’ve checked and the folders are there but there is work missing…………is there any chance you could restore the back up from the 26th Jan, this is the last time they were in their folders.

I’ve spoken to staff and told them to back up to Google but obviously they now have missing coursework from their folders!!!!

Many thanks

This has started happening more and more with different microsoft documents but this is the one I need to be able to access the most. I have attached one of the documents to this email.
Many thanks,
Mike

Further, is it possible to turn any login to a website, for example
Purple Mash or TTRockstars?
We are just exploring some options at the moment to try and make
logging in an easier process for some children.

I called earlier to get some help with this issue and have been asked to send a screenshot.

i can log in to the main FFT Aspire home page but from there I can't access any other areas of the website.

This is the screen I get.
[cid:a838b026-6b93-4482-b96a-400d4a1b25bb]

I can access the website from a different device at home but not my work laptop.  The people at FFT aspire suggested that it may be an issue with the developer tools on Chrome.

Hi,

Not sure if you are able to change settings for the following or if it's
something I need to talk to Vital about but I've struggled to get zoom to
work these days for the wellbeing assemblies.  I think there isn't
enough space on the school system for it to be saved to?  It's always
worked in the past but not anymore...
It currently sends videos to this place:
\\SERVER089.DRINGHOUSES.LOCAL\Staff\csmith\Documents\Zoom
I've tried to relocate to desk top - or anywhere but it only sends it to
the above.

Google Meet doesn't give me an option to 'record'  - Is this something you
can give permission from at your end?  I've watched the help videos etc and
it should be easy by clicking in the 'activities' bit but the option to
record is just not there to click.

I then tried Loom but sadly it won't allow screen and video at the same
time.

Any help greatly appreciated.

Clare

Subject: Network access/ DHCP issues
Morning, were experiencing a problem this morning where lots of users are struggling to access the network, weve initially restarted some acess points, but it in fact looks like a DHCP issue, ive just looked into client iP addresses and theres a selection of users who are being assigned addresses out of the student scope.

Please could this be looked into asap

Good morning



I hope you are well?



Just a quick email to let you know that BT have completed the FTTC
broadband installation. We need to agree a date and time to test and
install this. I’ve arranged for the router and modem to be shipped to the
school this week.



Please could you let me know when your IT support are next on site and
available to do this? If we could arrange to test after 3.30pm, that would
be great as there will be a short amount of downtime in service.



Thanks in advance.

Hi Adam,

Sheely and I are both having problems saving any work we do at home on our laptops. It has been a problem since we got them back in Sept. When I save word that i've done at home , it doesn't then appear in my saved files on laptop in school. I have to switch my proxy server off at home to use the internet.

If you can think of anything we can do, would hugely appreciate.

Thanks Hazel

"","","iPad update","Hi,

I have an update pending on my iPad but it keeps giving me an error
message.  There are 2 updates, actually, and I get the error on both of
them.

I got rid of a load of apps I don’t use, but it didn’t help.

I’m attaching the error message but it doesn’t reveal much!

Obviously, with our system problems right now, this probably isn’t urgent.
But I wanted to log it in case it’s an easy fix.

Thanks
Lauren

The assistant head who has just left (Lydia stonelake) had some school

Ihave tried today the username is wrong, so I am guessing that she has been

gone forever - she didn't have a copy of them at home.

Hi Jackie,



I’ve got three HP Chromebooks that were brought in from you that wouldn’t turn on, I believe they all have faulty motherboards.



The motherboards could be replaced but generally this makes it a more expensive process than simply replacing the devices.



Would you like for us to dispose of the Chromebooks for you?

Thanks for setting us up with the three Default settings.

"","","A few things","Good morning,

I have been asked to raise a query regarding the teacher PCs.  They tell me
there is a 10-second lag when running presentations on their PCs which may
not seem a lot but the teachers are finding it very frustrating.  The lag
is even longer then when presenting it on the interactive screen.

A further concern is the PCs in the PPA room.  I am aware these PCs are not
managed and we have had these since we opened in 2016.  Could someone
please advise me on how I can clean the PCs up as this may speed them up a
little.

Finally, please can you let me have a price for the cost of 4 new
Chromebooks.

Many thanks
Clare

The students couldn't get onto the tests last time and we had to kind of
fudge it so they could access the tests. It would be really good if we

The surface pro I’ve got, do you remember me saying vital could convert it to a Chromebook for about £30? Has anyone been in touch about it? It’s just sat in my cupboard and I could do with it up and running.

Subject: You Tube live streams - access


Hi Adam,
I have signed up for a couple of online workshops for my class (not till way after Christmas), but they have told me I need this...(see below), so I thought I'd check with you whilst I remember!

Many thanks,
Laura (Green Hammerton Primary School)

Technical bit – Please check with your IT department that your internet will allow you to access YouTube Live streams. Please note this is different access to normal YouTube.
