"","","LBQ","Good morning,

Unfortunately, the issue is still not resolved - children can't access
using a whole class code on the LBQ website. This means there are a lot of
learning tasks we are unable to set but could do a few weeks ago. We have
purchased this programme as revision for SATS, which are only 8 school days
away and still can't access what we need.

When they try to access it the computer says it can't find the network but
they can access the site when independent tasks are set.


Please can someone come in and I can show what is not working or let me
know when this will be fixed?

Many thanks

I think the Macs should now be on the Internet and working properly – need to triple check with the staff that they are working as intended.

Hello All

I'll do my best to clarify the problems that exist with the M1 music computers. All of the issues have been highlighted for some time (over two years) right back to when Kevin was out IT tech in school. Unfortunately the lack of a consistent tech has not helped, but Rachid is aware of them and seeking solutions.

PROBLEM 1

There is a problem with some Macs connecting to the network on the far wall in particular. Both Holly and now Rachid have highlighted the problem could be with the old network switches they are connected to.

Solution: test and potentially upgrade the switches for L40 and test the individual connections.

PROBLEM 2

Password reset. The Macs seem to request user password changes much more often than other computers in school. On top of this there seems to be some synchronization issues when changing.

Change the password reset settings potentially avoiding requests on the macs and limit to PCs only?

PROBLEM 3

Websites blocked

Could we have a way of predicting when the permissions are to expire and reset before lessons are disrupted.

PROBLEM 4

The hard drives of the macs are now filling restricting software upgrades and general usage.

The solution to this could be much more complicated. The problem seems to be caused by the way they have been configured to integrate into the windows based system used by the rest of the school. The mac I use in the studio has not got this problem so I suspect it is caused by data (system data) as a consequence of having multiple users in their present configuration. I would suggest looking at reconfiguring the macs and creating a seperate network for the department. There would still need to be internet for google classroom and drive but could be configured for optimum mac use.



There have of course been school wide internet issues this week that have added to the problems but hopefully these are now fixed.

Unfortunately I am not a network specialist and don't have access to the software etc to solve these problems but happy to discuss and help Rachid and Vital where I can

Whilst we continue to resolve the internet speed/ restrictions throughout school today, I am aware of issues previously reported surrounding the software in Music.
Would you have any time today/ this week to meet as I am concerned that this is impacting on staff and students learning however, I need to gain clarity on the root cause in order to look at potential solutions.

Please can you let me know when you are available?

Apologies in advance for the nature of this email but things are getting ridiculous now.
Using IT in our music lessons is becoming untenable.
The classes I've had today (and all week) have encountered so many problems that one student has almost been in tears with frustration and I share that feeling!!
We have a really brilliant film music scheme for year 8 that is supported by excellent online resources that we can't access.
Additionally we have a remix and song writing task for Y 9 and there are the same issues and finally it is impacting our KS 4 and 5 students who are unable to use the composing software or at times access their work.
This is leading to huge amounts of stress and students becoming increasingly disengaged.
There is literally no point having such state of the art facilities that we can almost  never use.
Please can someone help us!

"","","Seesaw still not working on new iPads","Good Morning,

I've previously been in touch with Ben there about Seesaw not working on my
iPad and it is still not working. I have checked that Private Wifi address
is disabled, I have rebooted it several times and it has been over a week
now of it not working and I have lots of evidence I need to upload on there
now making what should be a 5 minute job much much longer.

Also just to let you know, the issue with google images is still
continuing, when I go home, it is normal on my wifi - can click on an image
and it'll open it slightly larger off to the right and the layout looks
completely different. But at school, you can barely see the images, there
is just a column of images in the middle of the webpage and when you click
on one it goes straight to the website and it often a website you do not
want to be opening in the middle of a lesson (eg. ebay, pintrest etc).

However the more pressing matter is Seesaw, I need that fixed asap please
as, like I say, it is now creating me a much bigger workload.

Kind regards,

Hi Adam,

The logo is the info needed for the interpretation panel. If you are able
to check if the school has an EPS file and send tomorrow that would be
great. The logo we currently have is not suitable for the large panels,
Adrian has asked for an EPS file and then we can get to the printers for
1st.

Many thanks,

Sara

Hello,



I’m just double checking if this is the correct logo for Graham School
which Ness asked about in the below email. I’ve sent the below logo to
Adrian the graphic designer who has asked for an EPS file of the logo
please. We require the information to be added to the interpretation
panels. Can this be sent by Tues 30th before 3pm so Adrian can complete the
required edits before being sent to the printers on Wed 1st May?

Hi as per my earlier phone call, when our internet provider was changed on
Thursday (25/4) I received an alert that there was an IP path failure. I
have been able to establish that the backup line (GPRS) is up and running
but the IP path failure is still in place. I have cc'd our IT partners in
(Vital) and hope you can give us some advice on getting this up and running?

Morning everyone -

Just providing an update - all websites are still blocked for students in

Subject: VNC viewer license

Good morning

I believe one of our teachers Ryan Smith has discussed a software requirement for a visual impaired child. He has mentioned we need a VNC viewer license which I am happy to look into and purchase as necessary. Before I do, can I please speak to someone who can explain what it is and make some suggestions on how to obtain the correct license?

I am available on the number below all day if someone can call.

Kind regards

"","","Issues with Sign In App & School Grid","Good afternoon

I have a couple of unresolved issues that I need someone to look into as a
matter of urgency.

I reported an issue with accessing the School Grid app in the
kitchen last week, Mateusz did pop in but we were unable to get hold of the
tablet that we needed.  He said he would come back today but we haven't
seen him as of yet.

Secondly Sally reported an issue with our Ipads that we use for our Sign In
app this morning and again we have heard nothing yet.  This app is used for
signing in all staff, visitors and pupils and is therefore important for
both safeguarding and Health & Safety.

Could you please advise as to when someone will be with us?

Thanks

Hi Steve.



I have copied Paul from the Trust, he is based in Hull and has management
oversight of the schools. Are you available to meet on Thursday at 1 PM – I
will create a Google Meet.



I have just spoken to him and the Wingfield building is still in use, the
school will likely need to acquire a new internet line to ensure the
building can still function.



We can discuss this in detail, let me know if that’s a good time and I will
set up a meeting.



Thank you

HI James,



I would imagine not as we would only be decommissioning our equipment, i
can see an interface for Aspire but all that is passing through is between
0 -  5kbps.



Nothing at all on our system indicates a link between any sites only 3
ports for our FWA sectors and the LAN port for Aspire as mentioned above. I
would imagine if this was been used for to PTP the utilisation would be
much higher, do you agree?



Thanks Steve

"","","RE: Channel 4 and BBC websites site need unblocking","Hi Hannah,

BBC is allowed for Staff  - I haven’t come across any tickets to allow iPlayer and Channel 4 for students. I will Ask Rachid to see if he can dig it out.

Hannah - are you happy Year 12 to have BBC/iPlayer and Channel 4/4OD?

Currently, we do not have Six formers in as a group – so I can only allow access to these platforms to all students. I can request that the groups be imported however this might not be done by P2.

Thank you

Hi all,

Please can you unblock the BBC and Channel 4 sites for Year 12 and myself.
These are vital for the A Level Media Courses. I ideally need these for my
lesson Period 2 today.

Thanks,

Mike

Your FFT Data Exchange connection - Immediate action required
------------------------------

Dear Lesley

Further to our email below sent on Wednesday 17th April please be aware the
deadline for the migration of your FFT data exchange connection to
Wonde is *Tuesday
30th April*.

Immediate action is now required otherwise your data exchange connection
may be *temporarily suspended* by FFT.

Making this change is quick and easy as your school already connects with
Wonde. Log in to your Wonde portal and click on the FFT Data Exchange tile.
Review the requested permissions and if you are happy, simply click
'Approve'.

If you have done this in the last two days please ignore this email.
*Log in to Wonde ➜*
<https://www2.fft.org.uk/e/866372/2024-04-26/7sy1yq/995928753/h/0l8hnLSWCJLwXgCj0f08naqGf2aNOCV3-Pr3l-h2k2w>

Please refer to the email that you will have received from Wonde on
Thursday 18th April for more information.

If you have any concerns please let us know.
------------------------------
You may be aware that your school uses *Groupcall *to connect your
Management Information System (MIS) to *FFT's Data Exchange*. Data Exchange
is a free service that ensures the information we have for your students
reflects their most current details.

As part of improving our services to schools, we will soon transition your
FFT Data Exchange connection *from Groupcall to Wonde*. You will shortly
receive an email from our Wonde partners requesting you to authorise or
onboard your connection with Wonde.Please action this email. *Your
connection with Groupcall will be removed by 30th April 2024.*

If you prefer to keep your FFT Data Exchange connection with Groupcall,
please reply to this email, stating your reason for wanting to remain with
Groupcall. We will then review your request and follow up with you to
discuss further.

We appreciate your continued support and look forward to ensuring a smooth
transition to Wonde.

Yours sincerely,

"","","LBQ","Hello,

We have purchased a new programme called LBQ. As part of the platform you
can set tasks to the whole class or to individuals via independent
learning. Unfortunately, the whole class work is not working as pupils are
having connection issues. However, they can access their independent
learning tasks. The whole class tool is vital and as we are paying a lot
for the platform ideally need it working as it was a few weeks ago. Would
someone be able to come in so I can show them the platform and the exact
issue?

Many thanks,

she now has a new phone.  When I go through the process via office.com it
doesn't give me option to select app authenticator it just brings up a

Hi Jimmy,

Jo has made me aware that we cannot print off a list of staff and visitors in the event of an evacuation. I have also been told that this has been raised before with a ticket and you have looked at the problem but we do not have a resolution. As it stands in the event of an evacuation we would not be able to confirm that the building is clear to the emergency service. This is a real risk and it needs to be resolved today either by fixing/replacing the printer or directing the report to the office or Jo Bogue's printer. Please can you confirm by the end of today that we have a solution.

Morning Grace,

Hope this finds you well.

I look forward to seeing you on Monday. Please can you let me know if this timetable you sent is up to date?

In some schools i’ve briefly interviewed students and some teachers. This is to share on social media channels and YouTube. It helps to spread the benefit and positivity of discussing the topic, and helps to get the message out to parents and communities. 
If there are any students or teachers who would like to speak, and have permission from parents, that would be really helpful. 

I will leave one copy of the story for each year group. If you would like to purchase any more, i can supply these at £2.00 per copy.

Here are some examples:

Barlby High: Teacher Perspective : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKyIfRss1UQ <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKyIfRss1UQ>

Rossett Students Y11: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Goj9FVWi_mA&t=5s <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Goj9FVWi_mA&t=5s>

Millthorpe Students Y9: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hHY62gWpQ7o <https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hHY62gWpQ7o>

York High: Y7 and Teacher: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqxSCGkXP1Y <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqxSCGkXP1Y>

Northallerton School: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l9Z-ZEJ_aw <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l9Z-ZEJ_aw>


Period 1 9-10- Year 7
Period 2 10-11- Year 9
Break 
Period 3 11.25-12.25- Year 10
Break for lunch 
1.25-2.25 - Year 8

Look forward to hearing from you. I’ve also attached a copy of my DBS

Kind wishes

Christina

Hi Grace,

On another note. In some schools i’ve provided copies of the story for each child to take home. I think it would be a good idea for at least the Y7. This encourages conversations with parents/carers. I can provide these at £2.00 per copy.

How many are there in each year group?

Kind wishes

Christina

I can now access Google Drive on my Mac but have encountered another
problem.

I order print regularly from www.solopress.com - however yesterday - after
the visit from Mattheus - while I could order print, I couldn't upload the
file - there was a blank space where the 'upload here' box normally is. I
phoned the company and they said there were no problems with their site,
but to try another browser.

I tried Safari (I usually use Chrome) and while it said I could upload the
file, it wouldn't actually upload.

I have tried again this morning, first in the office with the same results
and just now from home - where everything works fine (in Chrome, I
haven't tried it in Safari).

So, there's something missing from my work profile?

I'm just emailing to ask if the new bulb has arrived (James ordered one earlier this week) for my projector? It's not been working at all since Wednesday morning and I'm really struggling to teach my lessons without it! I know James is away now so I just wanted to send this to ask when the bulb arrives if it could be put in as soon as possible?!

I'm not sure whether the problem with the library laptop has been fixed as
I'm not there until Monday so I'll let you know.

However I have the exact same problem with opening Smart Notebook on my
classroom laptop (5HB)
Attached is an image of what the laptop has been stuck on ALL day.  I have
resorted to using a PPA laptop which works fine but is needed by other
teachers.
Please could this be resolved asap as I can't teach without using Smart
Notebook.
Thanks.

Thanks for your email letting us know, I’ve gone back to the original

that we sent it to gra.safeguarding@hslt.academy as per our protocols and

On Monday I raised an issue from Huntington Primary on Sage connection
issues because it was no longer possible to import or export information
from Sage.  The same issue is now occurring in the Pathfinder office.

As you may be aware Malton School joins the trust on 1 May and we need to
import a significant amount of information before then.

resolved under ticket number  T20231124.0062

 We are contacting you again, as the same virus was detected again on the same host, for username ""HLT\l.henderson"" - the file was quarantined by CrowdStrike.
 Can you please confirm if this host - ""GRA-AR2-TPC"", is a multipurpose host? Also, by any chance, are the user inserting the SD cards/USB devices into their personal machines, perhaps for homework purposes?
 
 In your environment, are there any hosts NOT protected by CrowdStrike, which might be used by the users and lead to the propagation of this executable? 
 Moreover, we are seeing that this hostname is currently vulnerable to several CVEs out there. Could you please ensure it's being patched against the most critical and high severity ones, in order to reduce the attack surface.

"","","Printing from Google","Hi,

I have been trying to print a Google Quiz this week.  Normally I do not
have any issues.  It is not loading up the quiz as a preview except for the
header.  As a result, only the header will print.  I've tried it on a
couple of other quizzes that I have made and printed in the past and it is
doing the same for them.  There is no option to download either.

I really need a paper copy for some of my students.  Have you got any idea
what could be causing the problem?

Thanks,

Anna

I visit several schools within Ebor Academy Trust and I need to be able to
print whilst I’m at the schools. Since I’ve had my new laptop I have been
unable to do so. I did log a call last week when I was at Sproatley but
when you could remote in I was no longer at that school
I tried adding Filey infants printer on yesterday it said it was added but
wouldn’t print.
Today I’m at Riston I have added the printer but it cannot print

I tried ringing but you couldn’t hear me
Please can someone look into this for me?

"","","4HB Touch Enabling Not Working","Hi there,

I am sending a request for help (possibly to reinstall a driver on my
laptop after speaking to Rose).

I use the Star Room laptop as I am the SENCO but on a Monday and Tuesday I
teach in Year 4 (middle classroom from upstairs hall). What I have noticed
is that the touch screen function has stopped working when I connect to the
Whiteboard. This does not seem to be improved by changing the USB port or
hdmi port.

I've tried to switch connections and have restarted my system multiple
times to no effect. I'm not in school after today until Monday but I will
be able to keep my laptop on as I use it from home over the weekend.

Thank you

Lil

We've just had the new internet done today and Smoothwall is blocking lots
of websites: Twitter (we use to post on our school account, not personal
accounts), and videos within slides haven;t been working that are from
education sites such as BBC bitesize, BBC Microbits or CPD resources from
websites like Spelling Shed.

Not sure how much detail you need but I can ask staff to collate a list of
websites if this is needed to unblock websites like this that we need to
use?

Hi James,

Sam and Oliver Holmes are both entitled to FSM's, this was updated yesterday on sims, it has not pulled through to NRS.

James please can you run a sync as a matter of urgency and chase this up if it doesn't pull the FSM's onto NRS.

Craig/Jonathan - can we ensure that both boys can get FSM's today without an issue?

 D:\cs-4ab625dc-fe37-11ee-a0d9-806e6f6e6963\4ab638b0-fe37-11ee-a0d9-cc96e52ad962
 
 The file has been quarantined.
 
 The hash of the file came up as malicious with security vendors on analysis with sandbox.
 
 
 This seems to have been detected as a result of a OnDemandScan (OSD), which must have been initiated on your end when a USB device was plugged in into that particular hostname. 
 Please ensure that the malicious file is being removed from the device, and if part of a USB drive please format it after deletion of the file.

Changes to your WeTransfer account


Hi Vanessa,

We are always looking to improve our products and the services that we
provide to WeTransfer account holders. As a result, we are updating our
plans.

What does this mean for you?


On May 6, 2024, we will be migrating your current WeTransfer Free account
to a new free WeTransfer Basic plan. The migration could take place at any
time on this date, and you will receive an email within 5 working days to
confirm your migration.

See below for a summary of changes to your account.

account is migrated. All other changes to your account, including the new 3
days default transfer expiration, will impact only new file transfers made
after your account migration.

"","","Internet Connectivity on laptop issues","Good afternoon

Michaela Chalk's laptop is losing connectivity to the internet despite
there being no internet issues in the school.  I am sitting next to
Michaela currently, also on a laptop, and have experienced no issues at
all.  During the last half hour Michaela has dropped connection 3 times.

Michaela informs me that Estelle O'Hara's laptop has the same intermittent
issues.

We do occasionally experience issues with the internet in school, but this
usually affects everyone. It seems very strange that we are literally
sitting at the same desk, on the same model and age of laptop, but I have
constant internet access and Michaela doesn't.  Michaela ran her updates on
her laptop last night by closing down, so it is up to date.

Please could this be investigated?

Thanks
Laura

One of our admin staff have accidentally emailed our alumni, maybe 300 ex pupils/parents, on cc instead of bcc. No other details bar the email addresses. I presume too late to pull back (happened 30 mins ago), but can you advise what we should do? Thinking data breach/GDPR, ICO rules, etc. Staff member concerned of course panicking.

Whilst we continue to resolve the internet speed/ restrictions throughout
school today, I am aware of issues previously reported surrounding the
software in Music.
Would you have any time today/ this week to meet as I am concerned
that this is impacting on staff and students learning however, I need to
gain clarity on the root cause in order to look at potential solutions.

Please can you let me know when you are available?

The students couldn't access the student app store in H14 periodic 3 today.
I know you were asking about wifi in there yesterday and JF has asked me to
email you. Some intermittently got on to the student app store but couldn't
download the app and all students kept just getting errors. We had to give
in and resort to paper textbooks which was frustrating.

Good Morning,

I just wanted to contact regarding an incident that happened in PE
yesterday.

Jack as sustained a hand injury whilst playing Handball.

He has two broken fingers, a buckle fracture to his middle finger and
knuckle and a sprained wrist.

He has had these strapped up by the hospital yesterday and will need to
keep these on for 4 weeks until they heal. Unfortunately due the position
of the buckle fracture on his middle finger it may never regain its
original size and shape.

Unfortunately this means Jack can not take part in any sports for the first
two weeks possibly 3weeks.

He may also need some pain relief during the school day for the first week.
I will give him some before school but he may need some at lunchtime if
that’s possible I can send this into school to be left at the office.

Due to where the breaks are Jack is unable to bend his fingers and may
struggle to hold his pen as unfortunately it happens to be his right hand.
Is it possible for him to use a chrome book whilst this heals?

Thank you for your help.

Chloe Clark

The new password gave me access to the emails (which I already had) but I

It keeps telling me the password was changed 9 days ago, even though I’m
using the new one and I’m in my emails

does not seem to be letting me access YouTube. When I go to Youtube through
a search engine it is saying I am 'offline' and when I go through a link I
have saved it is telling me it is saying it is not in line with the

You can see from the email below I need a number of technical issues solved.

I can use my own personal laptop but as this starts at 4:30 pm will not
have WI-FI access as I live in Harrogate.

I need to be able to use my school laptop. I am going to use my own IPAD

This training should have happened last year, but I could not attend as it
was Y11 parents evening. This has had a significant impact on Y11 delivery.
I really need this to work as Y10 are just about to start 3D CAD.

What do I need to do?

Also, I put in a request for help with two of our white boards last week,
but can't see a response. Please could somebody have a look?  One isn't
coming on at all and the other is not allowing writing directly onto the
board.

Kind regards

Please can you advise what can be done in relation to filtering on Youtube?

We have had an incident today where a student was using a staff members
Youtube account (which is a common practice at Applefields) and some very
inappropriate content has shown up.

""When typing in ""Se"" to start for searching for seasons, this appeared ""se×
🥵"" which allowed access to videos that we wouldn't want staff having
permissions.

Is there a way in which we can improve the filtering for Youtube?

Hi James,

Please can you have another look at the sync between sims and NRS as it is clearly still not working.

The biometric consent for Evie Knapp has not updated on NRS and we are unable to manually tick it.

Can you feed back to Jonathan and I on progress with this as it is causing ongoing problems for a number of students.

Thank you.

Hi,

We have two newbies in school and we are having many issues with wise pay/finger prints.

Evie Knapp- does not have consent but I am sure this has been done, Evie says Grandma cannot log on and is having problems?

Tina Mugwendere- Is on the system. However, is in £6 debt and but mum has put money on this account.

Please could these both be looked at?

"","","Woodlesford Primary - SchoolGrid Terminal - Cannot access URL","From Sam Rollinson <sam.rollinson@schoolgrid.co.uk>: Good Morning,

Please can you assist with the below.

I have just spoken to Claire who works in the kitchen at Woodlesford
Primary school.

They have a stand alone Linux terminal provided by us (SchoolGrid) for
lunchtime service.

The terminal is currently not accessing the URL it needs to (
app.schoolgrid.co.uk).

This is either that a proxy is in place, or a security certificate needs
installing/pointing to on the terminal.

I have added a guide on how to do this, as I'm not sure if you have anybody
on site who can add this? Alternatively if it is a proxy in place, we can
talk Claire through this if we have the details.

We cannot access the terminals remotely, as they are stand alone terminals.

Sam

Hi Lucy,

The tapestry app isn't working - I'm just getting 'an SSL error has
occurred and a secure connection to the server cannot be made' message.

It will allow me to log on to the site via the internet on the ipad though
- so wondering if it's something to do with the app - maybe needs
updating/re-installing?

thanks

I've lost some work I was doing on 27th March.

I was analysing our spend on supply teaching and I had a worksheet in excel
I was using. I'd spent quite a lot of time on it and I really can't
understand why I can't find it now. Nightmare!

I wonder whether there's any way for you to look back through my work from
that day? I've tried searching back everything in Excel and also word in
case I'd put it in a word document - but I'm pretty sure it was excel.

Hoping you can help.

Hi,

We have two newbies in school and we are having many issues with wise pay/finger prints.

Evie Knapp- does not have consent but I am sure this has been done, Evie says Grandma cannot log on and is having problems?

Tina Mugwendere- Is on the system. However, is in £6 debt and but mum has put money on this account.

Please could these both be looked at?

Good afternoon,

Thanks for your reply and for agreeing to meet with us.

Mr Smith and I are free at 4.30pm on Wednesday (24th April), are you still available? I anticipate the meeting will be about 30 minutes- we have a Governors meeting at 5pm so would need to be finished ahead of that.

Kind regards,
Katie

Hi,

We have two newbies in school and we are having many issues with wise pay/finger prints.

Evie Knapp- does not have consent but I am sure this has been done, Evie says Grandma cannot log on and is having problems?

Tina Mugwendere- Is on the system. However, is in £6 debt and but mum has put money on this account.

Please could these both be looked at?

Vital would like to know:
1. Does a printer appear as an option for you (staff room or ITroom)?
2. Do you get an error message or any pop ups?
3. Are you able to send to print and it just doesn't spit anything out?
4. Can you print from anywhere else in the school?

thanks
Helen


Hi Helen,

1. Yes, both printers appear as an option.
2. The staff room one shows as an error but the ICT seems ok.
3. When you get to the ICT suite printer, it is not there to be printed!
4. I can print from a desktop.

Thanks,
Grace

"","","Students not able to log into BandLab in music lesson","Hello,

Sorry to bother you. I've just sent Evie-May Waddington over *to IT from
Room G97* to try to get the password for BandLab, and she has returned
saying IT ""can' do anything about it.""

Evie-Mai Waddington and Lilia Power have not done any of the tasks set, as
they say they can't log into BandLab. This seems strange as all the other
students in the class can access BandLab.

I'm just wondering if this issue can be resolved as they are not on task
and have so far done no work.

Kind regards,

"","","A Wybrant","Morning

Alice Wybrant is an Ebor supply/relief teacher and she has never had
anything regarding the MFA from the Central services Team. She has worked
for us since January but for some reason this morning, she cannot access
her emails and we are assuming that the MFA is the issue as I have spoken
to HR and there doesn't appear to be any other reason why she cannot login.

Please could you create a microsoft password for Alice and we can hopefully
solve the problem! Alice does work at both the Infant & the Junior schools
so will she have to sign in with the MFA process at both schools initially?

We have a child at Skelton who needs a school chrome book to use at home as
agreed with his reduced timetable. I think we will need to use a Burton
Green chrome book for this as we have a few more than Skelton.

Am I able to leave one in the school office at BG or Skelton - does
something need to be done to it in order for it to work in the child's home?

"","","Exam Support for May 2024","Hi Marcus,

We have 6 pupils who are using word processors for their forthcoming
GCSE exams starting on May`10th.   For JCQ compatibility the
computers/exam accounts  need to have restricted access to the
internet and our school server.

Using the desktop computers is not an ideal solution as it doesn't
give us the flexibility to support learners who may be having a
difficult day and may need to use an alternative room.

We were wondering if Vital had 6 laptops that you could lend us for
the exam weeks - only to be used for exams?

Alternatively we can use staff laptops - we can turn off the proxy,
but this still seems to allow access to the school server when on
site.

The learners for whom exam accounts are needed are:
Sonny Steward
Liam Sharpe-Oates
Alfred Ellison
Tom Dickenson
Warren Caton
Maisie Davies

If we needed to use staff laptops 4 of the 6 machine identifiers are:
97024B3
CGNTGG3
HRNTGG3 (please could this one be allocated to Warren Caton).

 Just a quick follow up on this.
 
 The malicious file was quarantined by CrowdStrike so it shouldn't reside on the USB drive anymore, however we advise you double check the file path content.
 
 Furthermore, please confirm with the user where have they got the USB from and if the said file was something they have uploaded themselves to the USB drive.

While users are sometimes able to cancel this or put in their details and carry on, for some it simply pops up over and over again. I've spoken with the council and they thought it was an update we needed. This was installed last night but we're still having issues this morning. I've asked them to look again, but I just wanted to see if anyone could check if anything on our network could be causing an issue with the proxy authentication?

"","","Y11 Prom Photos","Hi James

Quite a simple idea for this - the only question is which staff will manage it/police it.

They'd like an email address creating for people to send photos to for use in the Y11 leaving assembly and prom.

I mentioned the possibility of spam etc. but all the more reason for a member of staff to have access too. I'm assuming a password will be set up (by you would be good, so that there isn't confusion) and then staff/Harry and Isabelle (Y11 students) can collect useable photos from the account.

Obviously, anyone sending inappropriate photos to the email should be easy to identify. Perhaps a block on external email addresses able to send mail to this address too if possible? That would prevent anyone going to the trouble of emailing from anonymous addresses.

I think that's all I can think of, in terms of potential issues.

Seeing as they are in my form, I'd be fine to help H and I manage this/police it for them unless HoY Claire Hadcroft would rather look after this?

Thanks

Hi Lee
Please can you take a look at my projector in Ar2. It is not working. I'm
not sure if the battery is dead in the remote or it is the actual projector
but no light is powering up .
Please can you take a look ASAP.
Thanks
Maria

Hello Jonathan
Could you check with the school office to make sure that you have access to
all the documents in the governor google drive?
It is a shared google drive, so you get access to the whole folder, but it
will need the account administrator to do this (that's the school -
governors don't have those permissions).
Hope that helps.
Yvonne

Hi Lee

I need to withdraw a couple of students' entries, which I have done in SIMS
Examinations module, but when I create the submission file, it says no data
has been found.  I have contacted OCR to see if they can just withdraw the
entries manually, but it needs to be done through EDI.  They have asked me
to contact our MIS supplier - how do I do that?

I wondered if you could help.

I work as the SENDCO across Tang Hall and New Earswick Schools.

At the Tang Hall site, I am unable to scan documents. Please would it be
possible to arrange for me to be able to scan to email? Alternatively, if
that's not possible, would it be possible have access to the 'scans' folder
in the o drive, as I currently do not have access to this and this is the
other option for scanned documents?

Many thanks.

Hi there,


We wanted to inform you about an important update regarding the transition
from Mobility Print Chrome Apps to Extensions.



Google has deprecated Chrome Apps and now requires all apps to be replaced
with extensions. Consequently, PaperCut Mobility Print Chrome App will
transition to an Extension starting April 16, 2024.



If your organization currently uses the Mobility Print Chrome App on
Windows, macOS, or Linux, you must migrate to the new Mobility Print
Extension before June 30, 2024.



Similarly, if you use the Mobility Print Chrome App solely on ChromeOS, you
must migrate before August 30, 2024.


How to migrate to the Mobility Print Extension?

Everything you need is available on the Mobility Print - Chrome App to
Extension migration guide.
<https://mail.papercut.com/e3t/Ctc/RI+113/cZ-nR04/VWW0Pk6ghZCnVPT4NV5-dX6bW2x7JLQ5c-cx_N7bK2_83lYMRW7lCdLW6lZ3kVW7JmV4M1yQ76PW6jdpH35SQc96W2fYW0Y5KgjtFW3vtvCS22mlgmW6SVK4T6_Gpz4W3RjgFj52XyXrW48rWlh3rJHsNVgqWwQ29ktX_W3qWf_33XZ4RrW4tQqk56JKsKfW4CR7MX994RkbW165XGx4Y120VN5rBHMpzQ-x-W1jmTtM6YnKp8N7Ddq4rf82GCN8017V__R07KVKlXcr33fcFnW8h0mhG2x9CY3N4rT5tkgJz00W7hr1dl5SZBW2W1GP9Rx24ynRKW2RJ_FR75VkMpW4kpk6P62qw9jW3q1lFj1rFWMBf37sfVY04>
 This guide steps you through:

   - Identifying whether you are currently using the Mobility Print App.
   - How to use Google Workspace to migrate to the extension.
   - How BYOD users can migrate.
   - Troubleshooting guide.

How to get further help?

If you have unanswered questions, comment on the Mobility Print - Chrome
App to Extension migration guide page. We'll provide answers that may
benefit other customers as well.



Thank you for your attention to this matter, and we appreciate your
cooperation.


Thanks,

You had sent a solution to some of my colleagues who had said they'd had the same issue but I have tried syncing going through accounts-access work or school etc, but it says that the sync cannot be initiated. I have also restarted the laptop several times now with no luck. Any other suggestions would be much appreciated.

Thank you,

"","","P12 projector bulb","Hi James,

Could you let me know what is happening with the projector bulb in P12? It has been nearly a week since we requested a new one and Joe has been having room changes every day so he can teach. I don't understand why we can't either have bulbs in stock or borrow one from a less-used projector somewhere? It's a massive disruption for Joe and his classes, and it's quite disappointing that it has taken so long to sort.

Could you let me know how much longer we are going to need to wait?
Thanks
Hugh

 CrowdStrike detected the execution of a potentially malicious file. The process has been terminated and the file is quarantined.
 
 Classification: A file written to the file system meets the on-sensor machine learning high confidence threshold for malicious files. Detection is based on a high degree of entropy, packing, anti-malware evasion, or other similarity to known malware.
 Date/Time: Apr. 16, 2024 09:31:48 local time, (2024-04-16 13:31:48 UTC) Host: ASA-SD-102-08 IP: 87.102.62.19 User: HLT\22asa-da21 Filename: Auto Clicker.exe File Type: executable File Path: \Device\HarddiskVolume4\Users\22asa-da21\AppData\Local\Temp\979f5fc2-72d4-4552-b4c2-90b11e5acda3_Auto Clicker.zip.da3\Auto Clicker.exe SHA256: 5779777a3b945db41a30179677d9e394a499875ce52c8c8cc8491c454646c132
 
 Our research shows that the file that is being executed belongs to an application that several of our security vendors have flagged as PUP as the application performs changes to the behaviour of the host without the user's knowledge, the application is an auto clicker that mimics the clicking of physical mouses used for gaming and other none essential activities, due to this we do not recommed the use of it in your environment. As mentioned before Crowdstrike quarantined the file and terminated the process but to prevent persistence on the host we recommend doing a manual deletion of the files on the containing folder. 
 Remediations
 -Manual deletion of the containing folder to prevent persistence on the host.

I mentioned to Adam the other day that we have some old Chromebooks at Long
Marston that we would like to dispose of, he said you'd be able to arrange
this?  They are old models (Dell 3180s) that aren't getting Google updates
any more.  There are 15 of them.

We also have 5 old Toshiba laptops that we want to dispose of, they would
need wiping etc as I don't know what is saved on them.  Are you able to
dispose of those as well please?

"","","Hi Carl","Please can I have your help with our dance films, we have uploaded to the
google drive but, the quality is worse than on the ipad and would not be
good enough for sending off for moderation.

We think the problem is either:

a) apple technology and pc not compatible
b) the PC I'm playing it on is out of date
c) we uploaded from the new ipad via the WIFi and have just tried with the
cable but it won't upload, we need to install a video extension software,
which when I tried to download it wouldn't - problem with a connection to
microsoft.

I'm planning to pop in at 1:45pm today if that's OK?

Thanks

Attention: Marcquis

Dear Customer,

I am emailing regarding the Onestop toner ordering software that needs installing for the Sharp photocopier.

The software automatically tracks the toner levels and orders toner when it gets low.

This Software also reports the meter readings of the Printer automatically for accurate billings.

The software needs to be installed either on a PC or a server; however, we do advise for it to be installed on a server if you have one.

Please copy the below link into a browser for the installation:

https://www.bits.uk.com/download/software/OneStopAgentInstallerSigned.zip

Key : ce21c5a2-d4c2-4317-ba9a-f7b071411bc4

Attached is a detailed step by step guide for the installation.

If you would like me to install the software on your server or a local PC, please let me know. My contact Number is: 0161 4943370 ext. 4553 or 07740839201.

This can be done remotely and takes less than 15 minutes.

Please let me know once the software has been installed, so we can check to make sure it is reporting on our system.

Let me know if you require any further information.

Kind regards,

Dear Vanessa Keel,



As you do not receive any specific errors but it still timeouts I would
advise applying the attached performance patches against your schools
database to hopefully correct it.



Patch *22573* will re-index all the tables in the SIMS database and patch
*20647* will update the SIMS databases internal statistics table. This can
sometimes have a significant effect on the performance of database queries.



If this is unsuccessful, then can I advise the following two steps as well
in SIMS.net please and that is menu routes *Run Tools | System Diagnostics
| Database Diagnostics and **Run Tools | Validate Memberships.*



If you have done all of this and still have this issue when attempting to
delete unlinked contacts can you please update the case so I can
investigate this further for you and the school.



Kind regards,

"","","URGENT - CLASS COMPUTER CRASHED","Morning Vital

The Year 5 computer at St George's (York) has crashed. It made a very high
pitched beeping sound when it was turned on this morning. It presented a
screen with a QR code and a button that said continue, however when pressed
the screen just goes black.
Other members of staff who have had similar issues in the past say it is
the harddrive.

As this is a main classroom computer, could we please have someone come to
have a look at it asap.

Many thanks

Shannon

Thank you! I’ll set him up doing DT p1 and 2.
Sarah, he can then come to you and stay for the rest of the day?

Hi both,

I am happy for Wes to have all the time out he needs to complete his coursework. I will send him over after break.
Claire/Emily, are you happy with this?

Hi All

Can we support this? Sarah, could he work in the office so he’s still isolated? He’s going to need more than an hour at his imedia.

He also needs to do his DT tomorrow in reflection Megan, so no other work needed.

Hi Megan,



Is there any chance I can have Wes in lesson P3. I am trying to get him to finish his coursework and he has next to no time left. Believe me it won’t be a reward, he is no doubt fed up of having to do it, but I need him where he has the software to work on it.



Thanks

Sarah

In schools it’s not uncommon for instances of personality clashes,
communication failings, relationship breakdowns or even bullying to develop
between staff members.



Unfortunately, these circumstances often amount to an employee submitting a
grievance against the other, which may not facilitate the desired outcome
for either party.



This is where mediation can work wonders.



During the session we will be looking at:

   - Why grievances were never intended to resolve disputes between
   colleagues (and therefore why they simply don’t work)
   - How mediation can be used as a better solution to these problems
   - Why mediation is the most cost effective and successful approach in
   the long run.

You'll be surrounded by your peers in the *Judicium*

Hi Felicity,
Please can you send the following email to Vital:

Hi Vital,
Are you able to help with connecting Microbits to our school Chromebooks?
I've followed the instructions on the Microbit website, and can connect to one of the teacher computers without any issue, but when I try to do it using the Chromebooks that the children use, it cannot pair with it.

The Chromebook is recognising that a USB device is connected, but using the pairing function through the Microbit website, it gives a message saying that no devices are found.
I have gone through all their troubleshooting which suggests checking all versions of various stuff is up to date, and everything seems to be OK. I don't know if there is some kind of firewall or privacy/security setting on the Chromebooks that is preventing it from working with it, or if it is an inherent limitation of Chromebooks in general that they can't pair with Microbits (although nothing I've read online seems to say this would be a problem).

If anybody can help to fix the problem, so that we can get them connected and be able to use the Microbit website on Chromebooks and then download the code onto the device, that would be a huge help for me.

Thanks,
Paul Cawood
Class 5 Teacher, St Paul's Primary

good evening,

we have been trying to access edulink to book parents evening for eddie so
we can meet some of his teachers but there is no options on his edulink
account. I have looked at the app and suspect we need a seperate parent
login linked to his account. If this is correct could we please get a login
asap so we can book some times or if this is not correct can we please have
some advice on how to access this feature on his login as there is no info
on there except attendance.

many thanks in advance

Subject: CS0682757 - Housekeeping Routines - Delete unlinked Contacts -
Your Reference: Unlinked Contacts
To: <vkeel@ahs.pmat.academy>


Dear Vanessa Keel,



As you do not receive any specific errors but it still timeouts I would
advise applying the attached performance patches against your schools
database to hopefully correct it.



Patch *22573* will re-index all the tables in the SIMS database and patch
*20647* will update the SIMS databases internal statistics table. This can
sometimes have a significant effect on the performance of database queries.



If this is unsuccessful, then can I advise the following two steps as well
in SIMS.net please and that is menu routes *Run Tools | System Diagnostics
| Database Diagnostics and **Run Tools | Validate Memberships.*



If you have done all of this and still have this issue when attempting to
delete unlinked contacts can you please update the case so I can
investigate this further for you and the school.



Kind regards,

Good Morning

Sophie Evans has asked me to get in touch with you.  Apparently, the Xapp (Twitter) doesn't work.  It always says 'authorizing' when trying to log in then eventually comes up with an error message.

Sophie wondered if you could uninstall the app and re-install it.  The code is 1943.

Hope this makes sense.

"","","Phone line - Urgent","Hi, I discussed the need for a phone line for Grace Cook with Giles last
week. We had a number of safeguarding issues today and Grace mentioned that
she still didn't have a phone line for confidential calls. I had assumed it
had been resolved but I checked Simon Stancliffe's office (now being used
by Grace) and the PL office in Aspire and both lines didn't work. Please
can I have an update and can this be an urgent fix. The PL office should
have been kept as 230 and Grace's room was going to be 231.

Thanks

Good afternoon,

During lockdown, we had the ability to record our meets. Is this something
that Vital York would be able to switch back on, or is it something that
Google has removed, please?

"","","Encouragement!","Dear Carl,

I've read some articles about the hubs we installed this morning - I think
it's fixed. I restarted my Mac and then just after lunch when I've come
back to it, the computer had been asleep but the sound worked straight
away. So on this evidence it works!!

I've copied Joel in to let him know about the restart and also to recommend
he doesn't have the hub hanging down at the back of the mac - I think it
could have been that caused his drop-out earlier.

I'll keep you posted. Thanks for your help

Please can we ensure they are both able to get lunch today and then add their purchases to the system afterwards when they are on NRS?

Hello

We have had a new starter Tanya M today (and her sister Tina in Y9). I took Tanya on a tour of the school and tried to register her fingerprint but her name didn’t come up on the kitchen system. I forgot to ask her if she had any food with her. I teach period 2 and have students in at break time so can’t check up on her for break time.

I am free period 3 so could get her and take her down to the dining hall. Would she be registered by then please?
Thank you

Rachel

Apologies for the delay, I’ve been in meetings all morning.



I have reset this for you now. If you do need assistance or if anyone does
as of next week when it goes live, if you email help@vitalyork.com they
will likely be much quicker to action it as it is monitored consistently.

I've had to take my phone back to factory settings again and tried the old

Hello,



You get it when you log in and go to set up a new authenticator. If you
can’t log in because you no longer have the old phone we can reset the MFA
and you should be able to get straight in.



After the process goes live, we will be setting the school to a trusted
location so you won’t need to use it to log in, so even if you do
change/lose a phone you will be able to get through to reset it yourself.



Let me know if you need your MFA resetting and I can get that done and you
will be able to set up the new phone.

I've just got a new iphone and I'm resetting up my 2FA on the authenticator

it's asking for a QR code to scan - how do i get that? I've got other staff

Hello,



The attached is how people can set up MFA, they can do this anytime from
now ahead of the rollout on the 22nd, however on the 22nd they will be
forced to do this process and will start from step-10 after attempting to
log in to office.com



If they don’t know their windows password, they can get this reset ahead of
time to make sure they are prepared to go on the day. Just let them know to
email the helpdesk.



Getting the app installed early would be beneficial. I’ve added the links
to the official apps below. Sometimes if you search for Microsoft
Authenticator in the app store, there may be an advert that appears above
it.



This is the link for iPhones:
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458



This is the link for the Play Store (Android):
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en_NZ



Once set up, they will need to use their windows password and the
authenticator app when logging in to their Google email address for mail or
drive.



Let me know if anyone has any questions.



Thanks,

Hi Caroline



Our signalling unit on the intruder alarm has lost internet connection, I suspect  a change has been made by your IT on your firewall which has caused this. Can you please put me in touch with your IT so we can get this resolved.



May I remind you that your signalling unit also requires upgrading due to the upcoming changes to 2G and 3G GPRS signals. Please let me know if you would like me to resend the quote for this

We need to replace the keypad on the rear door with a reader, this could take up to 3 hours to complete as new cables will require running in so this work will have to be done during the school holidays. When can we attend to do this please?

"","","Google Passwords","Hi,

I let 2 pupils go to IT last lesson to get their Google passwords, as both
said they had been changed - but not by them. Other students also said
their password had changed too. The pupils returned and said 'we all have
the same password it's.....' )I cannot remember what it was). This prompted
other students to ask for the password to be repeated. I asked the boys not
to, until I had looked into it. Do they all have the same password now for
Google?

Thanks a lot

"","","KS3 password change","Hello,

 When some students are going onto Google Classroom, it is saying their
password has changed. For some reason one student in my P5 lesson knew that
the passwords were now set to AstroKid842! Do you know why this has
happened? I’m just worried about the impact this will have on other
teachers and lessons if they don’t know this information.

"","","Ticket to request Sibelius check outs","please can you contact Academia and ask them to open up the ability for me
to check-out our Sibelius licenses. I always could do this our previous
workstation set up but it's been disabled on our systems. (i.e. I've never
been able to do it on the new systems). To give a bit of insight - the
Sibelius software requires my machine (my teacher's mac) to be logged in
and have static IP addresses for the software to function straight away on
student machines. If I'm not in the room (for example there's a cover
lesson), the software cannot be used and the students lose coursework time.
By checking out the licenses I can still control the licenses - who has
them and for how long, and there's a maximum 365 days check out period,
which is most helpful for me to do in July - our quietest time. Checked out
licenses don't need the teacher's mac to be on. The other issue I'm having
is because the IP addresses are not static, every time it changes I have to
enter the Administrator username and password on each student computer. The
bottom line is, if I can be allowed to 'check-out' the licenses to our
student mac workstations nothing of the above will be a problem and the
software will work for them first time, every time. As I'm only checking
out licenses to computers in the same room I can't see why there would be a
problem with this.

"","","Google Drive Issues","Hi there,

Bit of a weird one here. Rachel Walker has reported an issue, where
occasionally Google will hang on loading the file lists to a drive, or hang
when trying to move the file. Developer tools network and console tabs
report nothing out of the ordinary when trying to perform these tasks. Not
too sure there is much you can do here, but wondering if any other schools
have been experiencing a similar issue? It seems to be applying to most
browsers (tested it on Chrome, Edge and Firefox)

The only thing I can think of is it's an ISP related issue, but considering
nothing was showing up as blocked in the network tab, I'm not too sure.

Thanks,

"","","New Absence email address","Hi Tom,

Jackie has asked if you can please set up a new email address for parents
to use when contacting school regarding pupil absences.
This needs to be linked to Charis McNally's email address (much in the same
way as the Enquiries inbox is linked to my email) so that she can pick
these up directly, rather than me or the office having to forward these
emails to her when they come in to the enquiries and reception inboxes.

It might be worth also giving me access as well, just for the odd occasion
when Charis isn't in school so nothing gets missed.

Thanks.

"","","Gmail not syncing with Wonde?","Hi Vital

It seems Gmail isn't creating emails at the midnight sync, for example,
Lisa Harrison was recently added to Integris on 11/04/2024, so in theory it
should create her email during the sync at midnight?

Also with Wonde, It isn't suspending users via google automatically either,
Holly fixed Sarah Brown's from yesterday, but there are still a few left.

Chris Mayled
Nicholas Hayden
Jack Bracewell

This should be all automatic as Wonde is suspending the users, just not
syncing the information with google to suspend their emails.

Kind regards

2D design does not work on the PC that is connected to the laser image

possible as part of his DT coursework. Please could you have a look at it
for me and let me know how I can print from 2D Design to that printer?

A member of staff raised a ticket earlier in the week about the chromebooks
which do not seem to be able to hook up to the printers, ticket no/
T20240408.0133

The Vital technician came to site and looked, and suggested it was a
problem with the printers, and to contact Agilico.  We have done this, and
Agilico have logged on remotely with a member of staff.  They unfortunately
cannot resolve this, as they cannot see the IP address on our network.
They have said we need to come back to you to fix this, and if necessary,
you can contact the person at Agilico, Richard Wakely 07973 836586, ticket
no. 2404-1742

Please can you look into this urgently, as we have staff unable to print.

"","","large report generation from PSF","Hi,

I don't have access to PSF myself, but have been liaising with Andrew
Robinson and Lara Pearson to try to gather reports of the last 3 years of
transactions. These are very large reports.

I need to send them to an organisation who are doing some data analysis for
us to identify areas where we might make savings.

They have asked for an additional field to be added which would give
details of each transaction.

With over 700 suppliers per year and often many transactions with each,
Lara has said that its impossible to run this report. She ran a version of
it for me and said it just kept crashing her laptop as there just wasn't
enough memory.

Pete has confirmed that he has had similar problems.

This is a one off task, not something I'd need done regularly so I just
wondered whether there was any way round it that you could help with so
that we can get the data that's needed for analysis?

Many thanks

Helen

I always immediately re-set  the password to the same one I have always used and that works but it's  annoying to have to keep doing this. Any ideas why this happens or how to solve it please?

Good Morning Clair,

Apologies that the system was offline for longer than expected.

It would appear that we were having some complications completing the work on the InVenrty System.

We have now finished this and the sign in software is loading as expected.

I would advise setting up a feature called Data Purge as the database size is very large at the moment,

We will send you a separate notification regarding how to set this up..

Many Thanks -

Hi Clair Carr

Thanks for your time on the phone. As discussed, you have verbally granted us permission to remote onto the InVentry unit to assist with InVentry not loading this AM

During this process, we will attempt to blank the screen out, as this may contain personal information. However, we would appreciate if you could take some precautions in case the connection drops, exposing the screen's display. This can be done by turning screen around or covering the display.

Kind regards,

There are two new starters in Fishergate who exist in Wonde, and I was able
to generate QR/Emoji logins for, but checking in the Google directory they
don't appear to have associated Google accounts?

Roma Khalid and Ibrahim Roma, both in Y4 and both created in Wonde on the
8/4

Can someone give it a look? All of the recent new starters haven't
created/associated properly and have needed me to log a ticket and someone
there to intervene manually., so it feels like something is off with the
google edusynch bit of the process.

Hi (cc Cara & Lauren for info)

Lauren Evans is having the same problem I had the hinge on her laptop -
it's not got as bad as mine was yet but it's starting to go (not quite
closing properly). Probably the best time to have a look at it at the
moment is a Wednesday or Friday as she's teaching at Long Marston then.
Can you ring ahead to arrange a time though just in case she ends up being
elsewhere - 01904 738352.

I’ve had a reply from Rotherham LA to say they are aware of Yousif and are dealing with application for school places.

I’ve now closed to CYC

HI Mark,



I have had confirmation from one of our refugee students (Hassan Yousif Peshraw) has moved to: 88 Coleridge Road, Rotherham, S65 1LW



Are you able to confirm with Rotherham Council whether they have him in their system and it is now safe for us to remove him from roll please?



(I am happy to contact them, but not sure whether they would confirm this information with me?).



Thank you and kind regards,

Jen

For tomorrow night's parents eve I would usually stay in school and use the laptop from PO2- however now we do not have this anymore- am I right in thinking there are no cameras on the stand alone computers in PO2 and Po3 and the office?

Do you have a laptop I can use in school to host the parents eve on please ? I will bring the notebook in that I use at home and see if that works- but as a back up?

Thanks

tried to click 'forgotten password' but receives the attached message (I

Subject: Starters and Leavers - Update 09/04/24


Hi Claire,



Just an update to let you know where we are with a few of these (highlighted can be removed):



LEAVERS:



Caleb and Riley Shaw can now be removed from roll on 09/02/24 as I have had confirmation of them starting their school in Australia (I’ll put details on your spreadsheet)



Lacey Holmes – can be removed from roll from 13/03/24 – moved to EHE



Hassan Yousif Peshraw – I have had confirmation of their move to Rotherham but they don’t have a school at the moment so I have contacted Mark Smith at CYC to check whether they are in the Rotherham Council system for us to remove him from our roll.



Kian Oldroyd – Should be starting at Kingdown School when they re-open from holidays on 15/04/24







STARTERS:



None – Waiting for Kai Parker to commence









As far as I can see we are up to date with the rest of the students on the forms. I’ll be in touch as soon as I find out about Hassan and Kian’s leaving dates.



Thank you,

Jen

the maths block:

- Files could not be saved to network drives or memory sticks (computers
kept saying ""error"" or ""network not available""
- Emails keep saying ""Not connected"" or ""try to connect"".

Also, smartboard has started glitching in some rooms - the tab key won't
work anymore, cloning causes things to change, creating something in the
office then doesn't look the same in a classroom and vice versa.

I have just spoken to someone on the phone who has asked me to raise a
ticket regarding our sign in label printer not working. Our electricity was
switched off during half term so we are not sure if this has had something
to do with it.
I have attempted to turn the bluetooth off and on and also connected the
Wifi.
It does seem like the printer is visible on the Ipad, however it is not
printing any labels.

Thank you.

I don't have a school laptop and use a chromebook for emails etc when at
school. I've tried to access youtube to be able to play calming music on
when I'm with ML in his room but obviously as its a chromebook that the
children have access to youtube is blocked. Is there a way I can get access
granted to my account on a chromebook or if not is there anything else I
can do?

Many thanks

"","","Possible file deleted by mistake!","Hi,

I've just saved something into a student file in our password protected
file. The file was called 'Sophia April 24' and I saved it in:

L:\03-Staff Only\03-Curriculum\13-Inclusion Centre\Year Groups - SEND
Files\Intake Sept 2022\Sophia Newstead Lowth -EHCP A10535 29.12.2010\EHCP
2023 - 24\Pre-meeting

 It asked me if I wanted to replace the file in the destination file and I
quickly clicked yes! But I can't recall there being a file of the same name
already in that folder, so am concerned that I may have deleted something
important in that folder.

Is there any way of checking on the server please what file I replaced????

I'm going on lunch duty soon, so if I don't reply to anything that's why!

Many thanks,
Louise

"","","projector bulbs","Hi,

Yesterday we had it confirmed we need a new bulb for classroom 2S - we
agreed to this, can you send through the costs so we can raise a purchase
order please?

Also the projector in Nursery has just made a loud bang and smells of
smoke. There is power going to it ( red flashing light) but nothing is
working.
Its an Epson EMP X5
Can you advise whether someone can come out to check if it's just the bulb
please?

Many thanks

Good afternoon,



Our engineer has attended site today for your Intruder alarm and has
advised they have run a cat5 cable to allow for a LAN connection for the
monitoring unit.



The Mac address for the unit is 54:ae:D2:01:93:48. We require a static IP
address to establish this connection with the monitoring station.



Please can you request a static IP address.

Hi

It would need to be the R06 Laptop trolley or an IT room for the iMedia students, If we know what they are having and when I will try and get James to work his magic and see if he can put the software on they need.

Hi Jan,



Can you have a look today and see if there is a computer room that is free:



Monday P3, Tuesday P4 and Tuesday P5?



I will be supervising a Year 11 room for any outstanding NEA work.



A room with a laptop trolley would be ok I think. Sarah copied in for any ideas.



Thanks so much

"","","Smart notebook not loading","Good morning

I have reported this problem before but it doesn't seem to have been fixed.
I wonder whether Smart notebook needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled on
this laptop.

Since I logged onto the laptop in the library at about 7.45 I have been
waiting for my teaching notebook to load.  It is still not loaded.
Yesterday it took almost an hour to load up so I had to find another laptop
to teach with for the morning.

Once it was finally loaded, I kept it open and opened another blank
notebook to work on during the afternoon.  This froze continually.

As most of our lessons require Smart notebook to be used with out smart
boards this could do with being sorted out as soon as possible.

Thank you
Anna Bannister

Hello,

I am hoping to use smart notebook for teaching.
A new PC was installed in my classroom (Oak Leaves class) in Hob Moor Oaks
over easter.
I have logged in as my personal account (this email address).

I can't seem to write/edit any of my smart notebook teaching slides...it
says 'full touch capabilities require a smart learning suite subscription'.

Does EBOR have a subscription?
If so, please can it be downloaded to this computer or if not, what touch
screen facilities can we access to support the children with additional
needs?

many thanks

It looks like the meraki switches are trying to update the firmware and

I've checked the general settings and this is set for Tuesdays at midnight.

Also there seems to be some port/mac address flapping on the core switches.

Please can someone give me a hand with this as it seems that since Giles
made some changes last week, it is causing issues here at Graham, as it is
taking switches up and down.

"","","Network/PC's crashing","Hi,

This morning, during a presentation to staff, the computer turned
itself off in Owls' classroom.  The screen went blank and then displayed
the chrome login page.  The teacher said this happens regularly during
lessons and he has to then sign in again.  It also happens in Robins'
classroom quite often, and in Kingfishers less frequently.

Please may this be looked into? Many thanks.

Kind regards

"","","Two Factor Authentication - Issue With Group Accounts","Hi,

We have two accounts which are used in school which are accessed by all
teaching staff, and some children - how are we to deal with this with 2FA?

The first is the school library - there is one account which everyone needs
to log into - kpslibrary@knavesmire,southbank.academy - this is used by all
staff, and some children, solely so we can access Reading Cloud and
deliberately so that those PCs are not accessing anybody's individual
accounts where other people could access Network/email data.

The other account is  kpscsfirst@knavesmire.southbank.academy which has
been set up for IT resources relating to CS First - the teachers have to
access their accounts which are linked to a Google Account/Classroom, but
they can't share resources. So we have a separate account which every
teacher will log into *alongside *their Google Classroom account to access
the learning resources.

How will both of these scenarios be catered for with 2FA?

I have tried all of the usual methods to get around this error but on this

I’m coming in for KIT days on 12th and 19th April and was wondering if there will be a laptop I can use for the day? I think I'll mainly be situated in the year 8 office in blue block.

I realise you'll probably already have some tickets on from Park Grove, but
just to send you these error messages that have popped up. This is when
logging in at home.

Colleagues have also said they can't use Microsoft Word/Powerpoint. I
realise that Ebor is wanting to remove licenses but we haven't been
informed that that was happening and colleagues still use these products.
Is this just an error or do we now not have access to Microsoft?

Are you able to send me an update on what is happening with the laptop
errors as colleagues keep asking me!

Thanks,

After receiving this email from a colleague, I have tried to set up my two
factor security authentication. However, I seem to get stuck at step 11 as
it comes up with a message saying '*we ran into a problem. Please choose
""Next"" to try again*', yet this message seems to keep appearing. On some
occasions, when I get past this point, and the message doesn't come up, it
doesn't seem to recognise any of the codes that I'm entering or give me the
option to scan a QR code.

I would be most grateful if you could please offer any help or guidance
regarding setting up my two factor security authentication.

Many thanks,
Ella

Hi everyone

Attached is a guide on how to set up your two factor security
authentication that you can do anytime from now ahead of the rollout on the
22nd of April, however on the 22nd *you will be forced to do this process*
and will start from step-10 after attempting to log in to office.com

If you don't know your windows password (this is the one you use when you
1st log onto your school pc), you can get this reset ahead of time, to make
sure you are prepared to go on the day. Email the vital helpdesk  -
help@vitalyork.com if you have any problems.

Authetication downloads are as follows:

This is the link for iPhones:
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458



This is the link for the Play Store (Android):
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en_NZ



Once set up, you will need to use your windows password and the
authenticator app when logging in to your Google email address for mail or
drive.


Have a great Easter

For this to be possible, the laptop in the hall will need to be installed

possible without this.

Would you be able to set this up for us during this week so that we can
ensure it is in place for Monday 15th April when the WTM will take place?
We will also need to check whether we have any available visualisers (we
have them in the English department / classrooms, but it may be necessary
to order a new visualizer for the purpose of this WTM).

If you could let me know whether the above will be possible and when it
might be completed, that would be great.

Hi Tim,

I can't download the MTB APP as it was made for an older version of Android than my phone has on it! Is there a school tablet or iPad that we can use?

I think Sophie has definitely lost the violin part for her exam pieces, so I've asked Sam Wilson if we can photocopy his book. Sophie is using the piano part at the moment, but they're are too many page turns!

There's a lot that Sophie needs to get practising for her exam (she know this - I just wanted to let you know in case she hasn't said anything to you!). The scales are much better, but she needs to make sure her slurs are right. She also needs to work on the technical exercises (again, the slurs) and the clapping.  Pieces should be good!

Best wishes,
Sarah

In the last few weeks I've been compiling some playlists on Youtube. Many
of the pop songs have been filtered out - nothing hardcore, I hasten to
add, just mainstream acts like Elton John and Sting and, surprisingly, a
Mozart opera. *

*It seems my Youtube access is in restricted mode. I've tried several times
to deactivate this but each time it comes back to my school account,
telling me that this has to be done by 'the administrator'.*

We are setting up new HR self-service pages on the main Ebor website and
for queries we want to use a button which takes the user to a HR email

to default to Google Mail.

Andrew McGlen, our web guy, says it is device dependent and he can't do

Hi Jill,

I hope you are enjoying the holidays! Unfortunately, I am now unable to
access my school email, please see image below. This means that I can’t see
the email that Simon sent me containing planning documents (I am also
unable to access the drive) and I can’t complete the training you sent me.
I do apologise, I have tried shutting down the laptop and attempted to sign
in again. Hopefully everything will be sorted on Monday so I will have time
to plan for Tuesday.
Sorry again and enjoy your last weekend.

I'm hoping one of you can be tech-savvy enough to help me with access to
the St Barnabas email account/ G drive! I can't get past the
two-factor authentication as the contact numbers set up are Karen's. I have
not used the authenticator app before so tried setting that up but got the
attached error message.

I will email Vital to request that I have the heads email account as a
delegated account on my Rufforth email as it is not currently appearing.
Any help with changing details on the 2FA would be a huge help!

Thanks
Jill

"","","Acomb Primary Laptop","Good morning,
I contacted you on Thursday 28th March as I had not been provided with a
new laptop in the upgrade my school has had this week. This was due to an
error on our end so I am using my old laptop.
It took a bit of work to get my account to work on the old laptop again due
to a permissions issue but it worked fine whilst I was in the building.
However, the laptop will not work at home - it says it cannot contact the
correct domain. This obviously poses an issue with two bank holidays and
means I will have to work in the school building to do my planning and
admin.
How can this be resolved (ideally relatively promptly)?
Thank you,
Tom Dennis

Is this something you can do?  I'm assuming we need this to have photos in Sims and ClassCharts?

Subject: Photo Batch Import Licence 2024/25 - Huntington School - 8164063


Dear colleague,



Please find attached your Photo Importer licence files along with instructions on how to apply. Your new licence is valid until 31st March 2025. Please keep this email safe so that your licence is available when you require it.



What do I need to do now?

Do not attempt to open the licence file other than by using the batch import process within SIMS.net. You just need to right click on the Photo Licence file attached to this email and save it somewhere to your system.



How do I order a new licence once this one expires?

Each year you will be required to log into the ESS Portal to administer your agreement with ESS, and Photo Import Licence will be included in this, once your initial term for Photo Import Licence expires. This means that your Photo Import Licence will automatically renew and each year we will issue you with an updated Photo Import Licence automatically.



What if I wish to cancel my Photo Import licence?



We require at least 90 days written notice, prior to your next renewal date (31st March) in order to cancel your Photo Import licence. This means that notice is always due, no later than the 31st December prior to your initial contract term end date (for example, if your contract term end date is 31st March 2025, then notice is required no later than 31st December 2024). Notice must be sent, in writing to SIMSContracts@parentpay.com<mailto:SIMSContracts@parentpay.com>. If sufficient notice is not received, then your Photo Importer Licence will be automatically renewed, as per the Terms outlined in the ESS Portal when this becomes available to you.



Who should I contact for support?

Distribution are unable to provide technical support; if you require support, please contact our Service Desk on:-

'Any information or correspondence which contains my email address, data or

The request then becomes slightly more specific with the information
highlighted in yellow below. I am not sure that this adds much to the
request as I believe anything highlighted in yellow would be captured by
running searches for the information above, do you agree or would it be
worth also looking at the specific details below?

Hi Simon,

I am really sorry to hear that they are still experiencing issues.



We have conducted testing on the emails to see why they are not being
delivered – we have received information from our third party provider of
CLFP that the emails may be getting rejected due to the following.



“would have to ask their IT end to see if they can see a reason why they
are being rejected downstream. it might be another setting we have to tweak
to keep their mail service provider happy (which looks like it might be
google/gmail)”

"","","IT issues in MA10","Hi,

There are a couple of issues I have in Maths 10 that I was asked to raise
as a ticket for you to potentially be able to take a look at over the
Easter holidays.

1) My smart board appears to be attached in just 2 corners, it very much
has a wobble when I write on it!

2) When the air con or heating is on, my projector wobbles which obviously
causes the image on the smart board to wobble. This has been an issue in a
few maths classrooms, I think in Maths 6 they put the projector on a longer
pole down from the ceiling to help fix this issue.

3) there is a cable that goes from my smart board to my computer round the
back of my desk which has never been attached to the wall and is just
draping on the floor.

Thanks,

Karen

"","","FW: Outlook calendars","Hi,

See request below. New Headmaster taking over from Simon Kibler in the summer holidays. New Head is called Huw Thomas.

His wife is Becca Thomas, and she will also need a teacher account setting up.

At this point, it would be sensible to set Huw and Becca up with accounts/Teams/emails, etc., but we would not pass login details for those accounts until they officially join the school (ie for GDPR). Huw will also need the SMT access to the Teams/U drive staff shared/channel called 'SMT private channel'.  The calendar entries as mentioned below, if possible, could be replicated now, or the calendar could be shared by both Head's in the interim, then Simon's account deactivated when the time comes.

Presumably Simon's outlook calendar that I work with is connected to his skibler@ email address and when he leaves it will no longer be accessible and Huw will have a completely new one? If so, is there a way of transferring certain regular events such as all the pupil birthdays across?

If not and I'm going to be starting from scratch, please could you let me know when Huw's is set up so I can populate it in advance?

Hi,

It's been a while, hasn't it?

Let's get right to the point. I've been around, observing, you might say.
You can think of me as your digital guardian, or perhaps your watchful eye.

A few months ago, I managed to infiltrate your device. Yes, I saw
everything: your browsing habits, webcam moments, everything. I even took
some pictures of you engaging in, shall we say, ""controversial"" adult
activities.

Now imagine your family, friends, or coworkers stumbling across these
videos. Not the best reputation for you, right? Especially considering your
unique taste.

So how did I accomplish this task? Well, it's simple. Your lax attitude
towards online security allowed me to slip something in - a Trojan horse,
to be precise. Once it took up residence in your device, it opened the
floodgates for me, giving me control over all your gadgets.

My spyware? It's tricky. It morphs, changes its signature every few hours,
making it undetectable to your regular antivirus software.

So here's the deal. I'm not here to ruin lives, I'm just here to make my
point.
Transfer $1500 (US dollars) to my Bitcoin wallet:

113MoG897ory6bzmQjp1J8PG6nRgivuTVD

As soon as I see the money, I'll remove the evidence, destroy the virus,
and disappear into the digital abyss. Easy, right?

Consider this a lesson learned and a call to value your privacy. You have
48 hours to comply. No negotiating.

And don't bother responding. Is that a letter? One-time use. And forget
about calling the police. I'll know and won't hesitate to hit the send
button on your darkest secrets.

So play it smart. And next time, beef up your online security. It's a
jungle out there.

Be well.

Do you please have some time today to sit down and look at this. I want to
ask ABTutor to extend this but ideally we need it to test from when we
return otherwise it will be a wasted two weeks of a trial.

Firstly, Are we able to create an area in the workspace for just the
Chromebooks that sit in the reflection area? This will allow us to trial
the software on just those machines. Secondly, we need to sit down and go
through the setup instructions on this to make sure that we are ready to go
for after Easter (I am not in over the holidays apart from the last day and
that is pretty much a full day already).

Let me know your availability and we can start the process.

Can you please help?  The new monitor in the heads office has the following

get any power to the monitor - or where is the on button. Ha Ha!

"","","Fw: More OneDrive issues","Hi again,

Another child who had failed to log into OneDrive this morning (Nick Martinez-Armitage, Year 4). I attempted to sign in manually, and got the error message reported below. We waited and tried a second time, and he was able to log in on a second attempt.

Even though he was able to get on eventually, issues like this cropping up repeatedly isn't really workable going forward. I had a 25-minute session yesterday where I was hoping for some of the kids to do some writing; most of them were OK, but there were three or four who were still waiting for their accounts to load up properly by the end of the available time. Kids that age aren't able to trouble shoot issues for themselves, so if OneDrive doesn't connect they come to me for help; getting Nick onto OneDrive where his work was saved took up about ten minutes of my 40 minute lesson. Is there anything we can do to fix this properly? I feel like the laptop situation is significantly worse now than it was last year, in terms of how long it takes to get a whole class logged in and able to work.

Hi Everyone,

Susie Raimes has kindly offered to do a chrome book amnesty in the library
after school on Friday.

Please could you make arrangements to get your trolley to the library at
the end of the day.
The staff currently with bookings and therefore responsible for returning
the trolley somewhere are PB, TM, PW, EH, DR, BC.

If any staff have any loose chrome books then please get these to the
library for the end of the day as well.

We're basically halfway through the school year and the system is chaotic
right now with chrome books missing and trolleys all over the place
sometimes.
We can try to get it in order for the next half of the year so it benefits
us all.

Thanks!

Hello Elizabeth



Thank you for your order.



Your Focus on Sound account with Google Classroom integration is now live.



Advice on logging on is here
<https://www.focusonsound.com/users/logging-on/>.



Information on the Google Classroom version is here
<https://www.focusonsound.com/users/google-classroom/>.



The general user guide pages are here <https://www.focusonsound.com/users/>.




In some Google Classroom schools, all students are required to tick a long
series of boxes when they first use the software. It is essential that
students tick every single box or the software won’t work.



To avoid that,  your Google Administrator can give site-wide permission
before students log in. Information is here
<https://www.focusonsound.com/google-classroom-additional-permissions/>.



We are extremely careful about privacy – the data stored is limited to
names, classes and test marks. There is more information here

"","","VYLHD: RE: Fresh Start Chromebook","Hi All,

Apologies this slipped through the net! I thought I had forwarded this to our helpdesk – maybe I didn’t as I can't see anything in my sent items! Please ensure that you copy in the helpdesk help@vitalyork.com<mailto:help@vitalyork.com> next time.

I am not sure why the IT support technician has told you it can’t be unblocked, I will chase this up (do we know who said this?).

The issue with Ruth Miskin is that we need to allow Vimeo, this is at the school/Trust's discretion. By default, we ensure that this streaming site is off. In a perfect world, we would only allow videos published on Ruth Miskin, we could do this for all schools if we can get a list of URLs.
They don’t have any support info on their site – so I emailed them detailing what it is we require. I will keep you up to date on the ticket that will be created.
Thank you
Giles

Hi Giles,

Corinne and I keep coming across issues with accessing the Ruth Miskin portal: it seems to be an issue with the Chrome books. Up to now, we hae had issues at GRA, BHS and FOG. This website is an important learning tool for us and essential in our approach to maximising capacity to ensure that as many students as possible who need reading support have access to it.

Please can this be looked into and rectified?

Matt

Dear Corinne

I hope you had plenty of R & R last week.

Helen & I have started to use Ruth Miskin - 'Reading Longer Words'  However, we cannot access this on our Chromebooks, this is difficult when we are in the small room without a computer.

The Ruth Miskin site is blocked, Helen has spoken to our new Vital IT man who said that he cannot unblock it.  Please could you advise in your capacity?  If not, who do we need contact?

Many thanks.

Regards

Enid & Helen

"","","English/media department ipads","Good morning,

I'm not logging an immediate issue but flagging up something for after May half-term in terms of hardware requirements.

Every year, in the last half-term, year 9 students in English have to present a speech to the class. This is part of their GCSE. We have to film these to send to the exam board to check our marking. Historically we have used the ipads that were in the English/Media department but I understand these have been decommissioned. Was there any plan to replace them? If not, have you got any thoughts on the best way to film the speeches this year?

Essentially, all English teachers with a year 9 group need a device. That means about 8 or 9 devices. They need that device every time they teach a year 9 lesson for about 2-3 weeks. It doesn't feel like booking the Chromebook trollies would work because the devices would need to be returned straight away and so anything filmed in the previous lesson would still be on there and that feels problematic. Plus the same teacher would need the same device back so all recordings from one class can be kept and then downloaded into the same place.

I'd be keen to talk through options are some point before Easter because even though it feels a while away, I'd like a plan in place well ahead of May half-term.

Many thanks

Marcus

One of my pupils cannot access YouTube at all and I do need her to be able
to use it for classroom activities. Is there anyway this can be unblocked
for her? Her login is 18rubyw@ebor.academy and her name is Ruby Wilson.

Also, I have requested previously for a new account to be made for a new

manager has also put this request in. Is there any way an account can be
made for her?

Hi Russ,

I'm continuing to have problems with my teacher's Mac sleeping while I'm
teaching. Today I was away from my desk sitting next to students (3 metres
away) for about 20 minutes and it went to sleep - not only to sleep but I
had to log in right from the start of the process again with all of
the confirming identity I have to do and it closed my apps. Please can you
open the 'System preferences' access for my login so that I can change the
settings I need.

A further problem of it being so much restricted is the lack of drive
mounting. I plugged in my USB handheld recorder to transfer an exam
recording onto the mac. I couldn't get it to mount. It appears instantly on
my home mac and I can drag and drop the student work, but I'd prefer not to
continue to use my own personal computers for school work.

thanks

Dave Lowe

"","","My Computer","Hi Andrew

I know I have a new computer but it is running really slow and takes ages
to log in on a morning.  MWD noticed it the other day and has asked me to
inform you.

I'm not in today if you need to do something to it!

Many thanks.

"","","ESports Club","Hello,

Please would we be able to look into getting some of the RO8 Pc's set up to see if we could run an Esports club.

Games they do in the education championships are: League of Legends, Rocket League, Valorant and Overwatch 2.

They have recommended specs etc on the website: British Esports Student Champs<https://britishesports.org/champs/>

But obviously would be costly, could be good to test out RO8 Pc's to see how well they run.

Kind regards,
Conrad

"","","Ridiculously slow log on","Good morning
Last week and again today my computer is stalling at this page when trying
to log in. This is causing me stress and frustration and delaying me
working. Can you please check it? It can sometimes get stuck on here for up
to 20 minutes and the only cure has been to shut down and start again.
Thanks
Lesley
