   Do you have an Aux extension cable?   I want to move the speakers in the

"","","Easington Whiteboard replacement","Good Morning,

We have been offered some external funding for Easington school to
contribute towards replacing the current 4 classroom whiteboards (EYFS,
Owls class, Foxes class, Head's office room).
Can you guide us as to the most appropriate boards to buy please and the
cost implications with installation?
Also, we would love to install a whiteboard screen in the hall (similar to
the one in Patrington hall) that can be moved up and down depending on need
and also a system in the Easington hall to link to this? There is currently
a projector in that hall that doesn't work is all.

We also need to cost out the price to replace the whiteboard in our
Patrington EYFS.

I am aware that these costs don't come under our Vital hardware replacement
package, but hoped you may be able to advise?

Kind regards

"","","Google Shortcut not working","Good morning,

My google shortcut has stopped working for some reason - when I used it
this morning, it was not loading properly, so I deleted it from my taskbar
and then re-added it, but when I click on the google icon now, it comes up
with a message saying 'the shortcut has been changed or moved, so it will
no longer work properly'.

I don't suppose you know how to fix this? If so, do you know if I will be
able to get my old bookmarks back? I'm using Microsoft Edge at the moment
to access my emails, but it would be great if I could get my Google Chrome
account up and running again with my saved bookmarks.

Hi,

Hope you are well. Please can you add me to the Head's email list so I get
Red Box access and anything else I need, as I'm not getting anything at the

Thanks

Hi there,
I think I have managed to lock myself out of my new account??
I have followed the steps given to us which took me to the microsoft log
in.
I used the work email as I thought this would be correct, however it said I
used the wrong details too many times. I had the app ready to scan the QR
code but microsoft wouldn't allow me to get that far??
Was I not supposed to use the work email to log in to microsoft? this was
unclear. Was I supposed to just enter my name?
what a shame I wasn't quite able to make that easy?!? Somehow these things
always seem to go wrong for me!!
I am not sure what to do now to be honest??
I am not at work on Monday and Tues but I am intending to come in on Wed.
would you be in school then at all? It would be really good if we could get
this sorted before the holidays really set in.
I had deleted my old account, but for the next few days I have set it back
up again, as not having my account freaked me out!!
I am not sure if my attempts at logging in may mean something now needs
unlocking??
I'm sure it will get sorted but for some of us it may take a little
longer!! :-) Sorry!!

Sam xx

"","","Vital Requested a Quotation for Carrie","Good morning to you both,

In the absence of Hayley Wilkinson our previous School Business Partner and
the departure of Carrie Drewer, I am picking up some bits that would
require attention to ensure our pupils have the resources needed for
September.

I have managed to look into the quotation no. Our Ref: ETLQ028066

This is something we require for Blossoms class. Please can we go ahead
with the installation of this, the main focus and feedback from the class
teacher is that the wires require trunking to ensure pupils cannot pull and
break the ports, which has happened on this occasion.

If we can go ahead and book a suitable time for installation I will liaise
with Sewells to ensure access is available.

Many thanks, Olivia

The system supplier is trying to get the tablet used in your kitchen connected to the Wi-Fi, however are having issues getting this whitelisted.



Please would you be able to put me in touch with your senior onsite/’regional’ IT Technician, to discuss this with them?

There is no mobile signal where I live so it would be helpful to have Wi-Fi

"","","2FA - Help Needed","Hi,

I am experiencing great difficulty in getting new starters set up on their
email.
When 2FA was first rolled out, staff were able to set this up from home but
this is no longer possible and instead, staff have to register their email
once they start work.

What I am finding is the majority of staff are unable to get a phone signal
in school which is proving very tricky getting them registered.  More
recently, I had to take my laptop outside so a new starter could register
but I cannot sustain this as it is far too time-consuming.  Is there any
other way they are able to get their emails set up?

Please can someone give me a call to discuss.

Kind regards
Clare

"","","Hello from Vale of York and thank you for this year - a few final questions.","Hi Jonny and Paul (is Jonny still on holiday)?

Just thought I would introduce Susie, our wonderful technician. She is very
keen to keep the laser cutter in tip top shape and so might have some
questions regarding maintenance. I have also Cc my boss into this- Miriam
Zulkernain, she has access to the finances and so is extremely important
when supporting development.

Thank you for all of your support this year, you literally have been able
to help our students achieve great things.

I have a few questions for you and have also Cc Vital into this, they are
the company responsible for maintaining our IT systems.

1) Regarding the water cooling system. Do you have a number of hours that
you recommend of use that will indicate a change of water? We are now
keeping a log of use to aid our maintenance schedule.

2) What are the keys to lock all of the access panels to the electrics and
gearing? I seem not to be able to find anything- can we purchase spares?

3) Where can we get the warning labels for the panels and machine (they
seem to have been removed over the years)?

4) What service/maintenance package do you provide? We will need something
next year, so it would be good to start to plan for that as soon as
possible.

5) Regarding lens cleaning, is there something specific that we should use?

6) I have been having problems with the software closing down. It seems to
be when the file is downloading, it seems to stall and then the software
simply closes off. Is that a machine specification issue? It is the file
size (is there a maximum)? Or other?

The latter question is also important for Vital to understand as I feel as
though the dedicated PC connected to the laser cutter is at the end of its
life. It is extremely slow to even boot up.

Regards

Edward J Lyell

"","","Urgent - Delegated Mailbox Access (HPA)","Good morning,

Russ has asked me to log this as a job on the helpdesk as he is completing
project work this week. Please could this be completed today please, as
this staff member won't be in during school holidays.

Please could somebody be in touch with Tamara Andrew at Huntington Primary
Academy to guide her with getting access and setting up delegated access to
office@hpa.pmat.academy and parents@hpa.pmat.academy - she seems to be
struggling with getting access to these mailboxes, although these do need
to be delegated. Russ says she must sign in before these can be delegated?

Many thanks,
Mia

Hello,

Please could you ring Vital for me and see if they could let me use
disney + just for one day?
We were planning on watching the film Holes as it's our class book after we
have read it, however there isn't a DVD drive and all websites to watch it
are blocked 🤞🤞🤞.
Last time I used Google Play, but that is blocked too now.

Thank you xx

"","","Miaoda educational toy for children","From wangshuai@szshanjia.com: Dear friend,

We would like to introduce you to our innovative educational toy for children called Miaoda. Miaoda is made from tough and non-toxic polypropylene, making it the perfect toy for indoor and outdoor play. It is durable and won't rust, rot, or fade.

Miaoda is not just an ordinary toy; it can be anything that a child wants it to be! It can transform into a life-size playhouse, a jungle gym, a puppet theatre, or even furniture. With the addition of a mobile kit, it can become a wheelbarrow, rickshaw, or even an aeroplane.

We believe that Miaoda can inspire creativity and imagination in children, and we would love for you to consider adding it to your product line. Please let us know if you have any questions or would like to place an order.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

This is Emma Feneley from Knavesmire Primary School. Can you help me with
some pupil general logins please? The current Year 2 classes don't seem to
have up to date records for all their pupil logins, and we will be needing
these when they move up to us in Year 3 in September. Is there any chance
you are able to send us the full list of both Year 2 class' logins from
this year please?

I could attach class lists of all the children's names if this is needed?
Or if it helps you to check for the right cohort, it is the year group with
a child called Jacob Fentiman.

Many thanks for your help,
Emma.

"","","Class Computer connection issues - still!","Hi again,

I'm afraid my class computer is still having issues connecting to the
board. Now the monitor isn't turning on or just has a light blue screen.
I'm sure there must be a hardware issue somewhere. Although when the
monitor was working it did usually connect to the board, this was
haphazard, meaning the odd day I couldn't use it. It's driving me mad at
this point! Is there any chance this can be resolved - again!

Thank you,

I'll sort out the phones for the team, I'm just awaiting a license to be

As a sideline - What phones do yourself, Marie and Alexis need for next

Alexis, I assume you'll take Mike's extension? 5230

Andrew - Are you moving to a MAT extension number?

Marie - The Headteacher number is 5301

We have bought two storytelling devices for our EYFS classrooms. They
require school wifi to set up and use, as well as an app - I have been able
to download the app but I cannot connect them as new devices.

I was hoping to set them up before the new school year, but they only
arrived this week.
I know exactly how to set them up as I have the same device at home.

When do you think it is likely that you could assist with set up?

Many thanks,

At Scarcroft Primary School, we wish to encourage staff to have a healthy
work-life balance and therefore we discourage the sending of emails outside
of the traditional working day. Where emails are re- ceived after 6pm, over
the weekend or during a holiday period, it is likely that a response will
be given during the school’s normal work- ing hours. Thank you in advance

"","","PS Purchasing log in problems","Hi,

I have been contacted by Lucy at All Saints regarding logging into PS
Purchasing. Lucy is the third person today that I have heard is having
trouble logging in and has been unable to login all of today. The others
having trouble were Tockwith Primary Academy and Caren Grieves.

Lucy sent me the attached screenshot.

I have been able to login fine but I was wondering if the issue might be
something to do with the firewall as the people who are trying to login are
not on the vital network when they try to login.

Kind regards

"","","Accessing school emails from home","Hello

I have always been able to access school emails (from this Outlook acct) from home, using the authy 2 factor sign in system.  I now don't seem able to access it anymore.  When I input the generated authy  code it just says ""not the code we expected"" (or similar).

There does seem to be a 4th sign in request option now (in addition to text, call, generated code) and it's Microsoft Authenticator.  Do I need to be using that now?

It's possible something has changed due to Joanne Coultas setting herself up to have the emails added to her mobile phone last week??

If you could please advise asap that would be amazing.   I definitely need to be able to access emails from home during the hols.


Many thanks

"","","For the attention of Julia","Good afternoon

Thank you for the call this morning.  I have spoken to the head and she has
said that we do not need to repair the ipads, they can be disposed of.
Will this reduce our managed service fee for Riston?

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

"","","Computer screens","Hi

As teams are moving offices could we please have second screens in the year
eleven office.

I believe that the year 9 team also want their second screens so it may be
best just to leave the year ten screens and use the year 9 screens for the
year eleven office then you are only moving one set of screens instead of
two.

So year nine office screens to year 11 office
Leave the double screens in the year ten office

Also there is an extra phone connected in the year ten office that is not
currently working but seems to be connected
The year ten office has requested another phone so if the non
working phone could be sorted out that would resolve the phone issue in
year ten office. Someone will probably need to come and take a look.

Hope this all makes sense

Thanks in advance

"","","HELP!! Laptop trolley wheels fallen off","Hi James,

My year 7s accidentally brought the laptop trolley to the bottom of the stairs at the far end of Wilberforce instead of just the laptops (as I asked) and two of the wheels fell off the trolley  so it is stuck there. It is the Chromebooks from C02!!

Be grateful if someone could come and help before lesson change over

Suzie

"","","Powering down server","Hi,

I discussed with Lewis when I was speaking to him yesterday, that the power
will be switched off at Staveley school from 5th-8th August due to a new
fire alarm and electrical board being fitted.  Lewis advised that we should
arrange for you to power down the server prior to the power going off, and
that this could be done remotely.  Can you please arrange for this to be
done at 12noon on Thurs 3rd Aug. If there are any issues with doing this
remotely, can you please come to site on 3rd or 4th Aug to power it down. If
you would prefer to do it earlier so there's more time to get to site if
needed if the remote power down doesn't work, please let me know. If you
need to contact anyone on site on those dates, please contact Dan
Binks on 07964
881886 - Dan is from Tom Willoughbys and is overseeing the works on site.

I'll give you my mobile number as well, but I will be in Switzerland on
those dates so it's unlikely you'll get hold of me! 07922 039150.

Can you please confirm that this is booked in.

Thanks,
Carrie

"","","Walking Talking Mocks - English 23/24","Good afternoon all,

Firstly, thank you so much for supporting the first Walking Talking Mock
that took place a couple of weeks ago with the Delta director. Below are
the dates that the hall will be being used for the same event. The Walking
Talking mocks will run from 9.15 and will last two hours.

18.9.23
16.10.23
30.10.23
15.1.24
29.1.24
19.2.24
8.4.24
22.4.24

Please could I ask that I have the hall set up in the same way: exam desks,
that can be pushed together closer to avoid using the raised seating and
the stage.

Mike, the projector screen will need to be set up, along with a laptop and
a visualizer, please.

Karen, there will be the new Director of English Matt O'Neil coming in, so
it may be worthwhile having him booked in as a visitor.

Ang, I will print the papers and get all of the equipment but if you could
help me set the hall up that would be great.

Thank you so much,

Jen has been trying to set up Access It to send emails, and when she tries

Your start date is 1st September and students aren't back until 5th, so this will buy you a little time.

I've never had this problem before.  I'm just running through the
powerpoint for our church celebration tomorrow and I can't access the first
song link on youtube. It is literally a children's hymn from kidsyoutube.
But I do have other songs all of which are on youtube that I will need to
access asap.
Are you able to help?

I'm worried it may have something to do with the new academy gmail being
set up this morning on my laptop but I'm using my poppleton road google
account and not the new one for this.
I'm on the SEN laptop and not my class one and will be taking the SEN
laptop to church tomorrow.

It is only us 2 that have access to these.

In addition, the following folders are missing:

   - SGY SEN

The SGY SEN is the most important one of the above for before the summer

How do the rest of the staff get access to the shared drives?

"","","Fwd: Your deletion of Rachael Goldsmith from Google Workspace was successful","Hi,

My colleague Rachael Goldsmith has a new Trust account; we deleted her YHS
account (r.goldsmith@yorkhigh.southbank.academy) and selected to transfer
all her data into her new account (r.goldsmith@southbanktrust.co.uk); I
received an email below suggesting this was successful.

However Rachael says that this hasn't worked; she says some of her Google
drive has transferred but not all of it, and she doesn't have her emails.

Any ideas why it hasn't worked and if anything can be done to correct this?

Many thanks in advance

I have been given your details by Chloe Dolphin who has been working with
me on planning the ISSP Summer School taking place at Manor Academy all
next week. I understand you are the person to speak to to arrange all
things IT!? Is it possible to request the following:

   - Chromebooks and IPADs? I understand from Chloe that you have a trolley
   with 30 chromebooks and a further 25 in other locations. Is it possible to
   use these? Also, do you have IPADS available in addition to these?
   - Is it possible to request staff and pupil log in's via yourself? The
   staff need to be able to access printers and photocopiers with their
   log-ins.
   - Finally, lanyards / key cards - I think these

Thank you so much in advance.

I have had a look to see if there is a notification button switched on to
activate all these notifications but cannot find it.  Please can you take a

If there is no easy find would it do any harm if we each deleted the

Multi Factor Authentication for SharePoint - Preparing for Summer Results

Dear Colleague,

In June we wrote to all customers who use SharePoint to upload assessment
material for Pearson Qualifications, advising you that we had introduced
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) as an additional layer of security to
help protect your centre and learner data.

While many of our centre users have successfully gone through the MFA
process for SharePoint, we are aware that you have not yet registered and
the next time you may try and log in is on a centre or learner results day.


If you are a user who may need to access your SharePoint sites over the
results or post results period, *we urge you to register for MFA now*. Our
teams will be extremely busy supporting results-related queries during
August. *If you act now, you will find it quicker to access support*,
should you need it.

Please note: You should have received your SharePoint MFA invitations from
us over the past few weeks, which will be received from *'Microsoft
Invitations on behalf of Pearson PLC'*, so please check your email accounts
and junk folders and follow the guidance articles below. Please also ask
your IT department to add this email address to your list of safe contacts.

"","","Info - ITT End of Year.","Afternoon all,

I hope you're all well and enjoying the End of Year Activities!

This is a fairly long email I'm afraid, with a few key pieces of information - and lots of 'thank yous'!

It has been another fantastic year of Teacher Training at Huntington - we have increased our cohort, have offered more placements, have worked with up to 5 training providers, the list goes on! The team just keeps increasing in experience and numbers and it's great and it's what our profession needs!


  *   We say goodbye and good luck to Alex this week. Thank you Alex for all that you have done to support our trainees over your time as Maths ITT Mentor. I'm sorry that recruitment numbers haven't enabled up to host placements recently! We wish you all the best as your move on to new adventures.
  *   Huntington HR Team - thank you for supporting us with all the Safeguarding and DBS Checks so that our trainees can start their placements smoothly. I know the turn around on these can be pretty swift! So your willingness to drop everything and ensure that all checks are in place are hugely appreciated.
  *   Claire and James - thank you for setting up all matters-relating to PCs/ClassCharts/emails/printing and for your patience with some of the trainees panics with logging in! Having all of the information for log-ins etc is so important to ensure our trainees feel welcomed into school. Thank you so much.
  *   We welcome David and Natasha to the ITT mentoring Team next year! Exciting! David will be hosting a Training Teacher from Pathfinder/SHU in Social Sciences. And Natasha will be the PE Mentor (it's just so unfortunate that recruitment is down for you Natasha - hopefully this time next year will be different. Fingers Crossed).

Lastly - you, the amazing Huntington ITT Mentoring Team!

The work you do is hugely important. Without you, we would not have the next generation of teachers to care for and to educate the young people in our community.

Never before has ITT and ECT been so important in school and indeed society - with recruitment onto ITT Courses looking bleak again, it is your knowledge and coaching that is securing the future of the profession.

I repeat - The work you do is so important.

I feel proud and lucky to work alongside such great practitioners.

Have a lovely holiday when it arrives - 4 more get ups!

Alister.

  1.  Dates and Calendar. Please find the detailed ITT Calendar for 23/24 here (broken down for each training provider) - lots of info on this, some relevant to you, some not. P:\ITT\Resources\ITT Docs\2023 - 2024 ITT\Calendar Master But......
  2.  Key Date. First Day for UoY - 19/9/2023
  3.  Key Date. First Day for Pathfinder/Sheffield Hallam - 18/9/2023
  4.  Timetables. Please check your TT now on SIMs to ensure that there is 'ITT' Marked for 2PPC. Action - If there isn't an 'ITT' Marked please email me asap. If you wish to change the time of this, please just email Claire Carr - we need to make mentoring sessions work for you between your teaching commitments, so if it makes sense in your weekly schedule to have mentoring Tuesday 4 and not Tuesday 3 (as it may currently be marked on SIMs for example) then just ask Claire to switch.
  5.  Whole School Issues Training Session. Will be held on a Thursday Period 3. There are a couple of occasions where it will be moved to a Tuesday P1 (already noted on the calendar above). So, if, you are looking at timetabling before the summer (obviously don't have to!) Then please be mindful of the need to change the time of WSI now and then.
  6.  September 2023. There are 2 weeks of term before trainees arrive. Please do consider using your ITT Mentoring Time to begin to prepare timetables.

I have just tried to use the printer down in the main office but it does
not accept my log-in and it won't allow me to authenticate my fob. I think
this may be a result of the technical issue we had with my account in June.

Many thanks,
Megan

[Keep your SIMS server ON this summer]

Hi Claire

Over the summer holidays, Wonde will be working behind the scenes to ensure the connection between third party applications and the Capita SIMS server at Huntington School is kept active and up-to-date.

To ensure your September gets off to a smooth start, please make sure your Capita SIMS server is left ON over the summer holiday. This will avoid any disruption to your MIS sync.

If there any planned changes (i.e. upgrading your server or changing your MIS provider) taking place over the summer, please let us know by using the link below.

[Submit your changes]<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcO9s1t4krLxJTpViNMtcFnou2lvsLuzurBJo0hZ5FL_BRwQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.762225268=A1209953900&entry.11148880=Huntington%20School&entry.347634880=Claire%20Carr&entry.1069112326=SIMS&entry.508172980=Claire%20Carr&entry.2121774861=c.carr@huntington-ed.org.uk>

I hope you are well.

Please can you let me know which telephone numbers are attached to the

I believe we have the following numbers:

Linsee - 6901
Judith - 6902
Alison - 6904
Fiona - 6905
Andy - 6906
Alexis - 6903 - Alexis doesn't work for the teaching school hub anymore so
I'm not sure if he uses this telephone number as he works in school.  Can
you tell if it is still in use?

Ideally we need to take Alexis off our list and disable 6903 as we don't
need this number anymore, is this possible?

Thanks.

in Sept - Lauren Evans, who's as Nun Monkton currently.  Can you please set
up a headteacher@tigfederation.co.uk account, so that we can share some
docs with her this term.  Can this be set up by the end of Tuesday (18th
July) please?

Once Lauren is in post, she will use that account for email etc rather than
setting up one with her name in - that's what she has requested and it
makes sense to do it that way.  We'll keep Liz Mellor's account open for a
while in Sept while we transfer ownership of her files across to Lauren.

"","","RE: Outlook Calendar","Hi Tom

I am really not sure about this as I am complete ICT illiterate when it comes to your lessons going into your Outlook Calendar.

James can you advise and suggest how the 'naming' of the lessons can be changed?

I have also copied Claire into this in case she knows.

Thanks so much

Subject: Outlook Calendar

Hi Paula,

Not sure if this is an internal thing or a Vital thing really - it's almost certainly not a you thing, but I'm coming to you since you sent the email about outlook calendars earlier! Hopefully you can pass this on wherever it needs to go.

I've started to get next year's lessons appearing in my calendar, like we had this year. It's been useful this year because it means I can get my day's timetable on my phone or watch, which is great.

So far only Y12 and 13 lessons seem to have gone in for next year, but there are two issues. Rather than the class code like we've had this year, it's gone in as ""Y13 Language Wednesday"", ""Y12 Language Thursday"" etc. It's much less clear, and if you have more than one class in a year group it's going to be more or less useless. Also, they've been set up with an alert to go off 15 mins before each one. It means I'm constantly fielding notifications on Outlook, on my phone and on my watch. On a 5 period day next year it's going to be unbearable!

So, before any more classes go in, please could we have them entered by class code only, as we did this year, and with no reminder/ alert?

As I say, I'm sure this isn't something you're responsible for, but I don't know who is!

Thanks, as ever,

Tom

Hi Craig,

As we discussed yesterday, the caretakers are moving my stuff into my new
office early next week and as I mentioned I will need the following:

   - 2 long data cables (1 for my computer and 1 for my phone)
   - A long power cable/extension lead (with as many sockets as possible -
   5 ideally)
   - A dual computer monitor power cable (you said you have one of these)

Please would you mind sorting these or I can collect them at some point?

Thanks,

A shift in how Sourcery works for closed source and open source projects

<#m_-6289262773470851016_m_7277126548462237777_>


Hi,

I’m writing to let you know about upcoming changes to how we charge for
Sourcery. Starting on July 12th, Sourcery is going to transition to being a
paid product except for open source projects and students. *As an existing
user you can continue to use it for free until August 31st.*

As a part of this shift we have reduced the price for an individual license
to $10 per month or $100 per year.

We hope that shifting to primarily a paid product will let us take Sourcery
to the next level. Here's what's coming:

   - A more powerful and faster core engine
   - Cross file & multi-file analysis and rules (Eg - ensure there are no
   unhandled exceptions anywhere in the call graph of your main function)
   - Support for additional languages. JavaScript and TypeScript have
   already been released as a public beta and we're working to expand what
   Sourcery can do there.
   - Real time insight to help you understand what's going on in each of
   your functions
   - Transforming Sourcery into a more powerful pair programmer
   <https://r.mail.sourcery.ai/mk/cl/f/bucgMvS3gkqc7bZesrW8ygsH3X1xpCgin64GKMpGVBx8o1JsmkMKYijuw7XyhDS2-j4sIbxsXZlgJom3svbaURJYUBZja2JfYyia7cxVgDhRxBsrhe-uGIBBlnISp__I_qlKwohC3FgNe_50fZnESHeiM8HsS-IRfCMipBLkUgGBofgW_eSttOcy0ZJJpLNxDUXoucmldl4GVBDZYpFe88N2gsGI>
   - helping with aspects beyond refactoring suggestions. You can sign up
   for early access here

   .


As an existing Sourcery user you are able to *continue using it for free
until August 31st*. You also have the option to *get a lifetime license for
$200
<https://r.mail.sourcery.ai/mk/cl/f/6Lq4VrMZIzfAhrSDOUMcFInvF2POIrbTQaWmdY1JUd9DGSKc-RoxBxLW6hSOhO6OKSip9IUkqXze-MVztsCSM-i0TNFHh7RgVeXERYHjjCp5SjKRJ_EpOLcYlhufN4KzLgF45YyS7-46YjTs7skiAAF6KOojwVDYxeoaK7qVw5i95ZGs-4cGbn4GY67R6AGiJu2k3FpF6BSLI2-f-9Q_1EVPPDOlnl4>*
.

For open source and students Sourcery will remain free.

I'm a developer, and I built Sourcery for developers. I want it to be an
incredible tool that helps people to learn about and improve their code
quality.

I know this is a big shift in Sourcery which affects you, and I'd like to
hear your feedback - and as always thank you for using Sourcery.

Best,
Brendan

Hi Mark,

Monitoring is reporting an issue with your SIMS.net installation. See error
below:



* SIMS.NET <http://SIMS.NET> executable/DLL installation corrupted *This
normally tends to happen after a SIMS upgrade and is due to certain
products (not EduLink) locking SIMS.net DLL files.

To resolve this issue just reboot the agents server. at your earliest
convenience.

Regards,

David.

One of our peri music teachers needs to get online for his lesson but can't
connect to our internet. I've had a look and tried switching the proxy on
or off, connecting to another network, but neither has worked. Is there
anything else we can try?

It is a very old one, and it was one of 3 Toshiba laptops I had on the list
I produced from the walk round school, so whether they are pre-Vital or not
I don't know, but regardless we will need a working machine in that room
for September.

You may have an existing open ticket about this - if so, please feel free
to merge. Emailing this so you have the link below to a video of the issue
when it is happening.

Mark Richards reported the problem with the touchscreen in Y3 a while ago.
Someone from Elementary came to look and swapped the HDMI input to see if
that helped (the screen was behaving when they were here) but no
improvement.

Someone from your place came out (I think last week/early this week) to
look and played with refresh rates to see if that helped - again, no
improvement.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GXkz0MA1aHF3Da8OyiZHWyF0xvCFRWwP/view?usp=sharing
is a video of the problem!

It seems to be that the external screen is dropping in and out, but the
laptop screen remains on.

Not making audible connect/disconnect alerts.

It is driving them bonkers! Can someone please help?

Annoyingly it looks set to rain heavily around 7pm so if that is the case, we will be in the sixth form common room. The Bistro Guy van will be in the P block quad, like it is for Arts Fest.

Here’s hoping for a weather miracle!

Subject: Summer Celebration Friday 14th July


Dear All



Plans are taking shape for our Summer Celebration on Friday 14th July



  *   We hope to be on the field and the benches behind the library if the weather is kind to us.



  *   Arrival from 6.30pm. Bring your own drinks.


  *   Bistro Guy will be here with their pizza van. You can order and pay at the van, then get a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready. The full menu will be available from 6.30pm-9pm and appears below so that you can browse and plan in advance. I recommend the pineapple and nduja pizza.


  *   Entertainment will be from our very own Joao who will be playing and singing live for us 😊


  *   For those of you that are feeling sporty or competitive there will be the option to play rounders or take part in a quiz.


  *   Please take 30 seconds to let us know whether you are coming and if you plan to order food by filling in this form: https://forms.office.com/e/iMYrqgCATH . It would be helpful for Bistro Guy to know roughly how much dough to prepare and bring with them.


  *   Baz will be kicking us out and locking up at 10pm so the fun will have to stop then.


  *   If the weather's looking ropey then we'll be in the sixth form common room with the pizza van in the quad.


  *   Parking: research school, tennis courts and front of school. Cars be left overnight in the research school car park. They will be locked in overnight and available to collect on Saturday 15th from 7.30am-5pm.


  *   Toilets will be available in languages



Really looking forward to celebrating the end of term with you all!

"","","Fwd: [York High School] Re: Email banner request","Hi,

We have a request below regarding the possibility of specifying
email signature banners; is that possible?  I see add-ons are available but
we may be constrained by what the Trust already has, if anything?

Also there is an open ticket for a telephone fault, logged by my colleague
Kyle Meehan. The user of the phone reports the phone has started working
normally, i'm not sure if you did something remotely but you can close that
ticket off (sorry I don't have a ticket number)

Hi Laurence,

Thank you for this.
If you wouldn't mind asking Vital if there is a way to do it, Rod is really
keen for everyone to have this on their emails if it's at all possible.
If it can't be done, no problem :)

Thank you

Dawn

*Laurence Kay, 11 Jul 2023, 15:00 BST:*
Hi Dawn

Unfortunately it's not currently possible to add an email banner to YHS
staff emails, at least not with the current level of service we have from
Google and not without an additional app.

There are apps available that do this, for  example
https://www.signitic.com/pricing and https://bulksignature.com/pricing/

The cost per user does vary by app but would be in the region of £50 per
month

I'm not sure how easy they are to set up but as they are extensions for
Gsuite I'd need to check this with Vital, as our Gsuite covers the entire
Trust and I am not sure how easy it is to say we only want one of these
apps to apply to just our email addresses and not other schools.

If you'd like me to do more research into this, I can speak to Vital
tomorrow; let me know if so.

------------------------------

*Kyle Meehan, 11 Jul 2023, 14:51 BST (private):*
Not sure we can mandate all staff emails include the banner remotley, I
think they have to add it themselves!

------------------------------

*Dawn Becton, 11 Jul 2023, 14:29 BST:*

Rod is asking if it is possible please to have this banner added to all
staff emails from Friday this week?

Rod would like to let parents know about the nomination prior to us
displaying the banner.

Hope it makes sense!

Hi Rod,

Unfortunately, due to GDPR I am not allowed to give you details of who
nominated you.

It was about all the fantastic work you do with helping families with the
cost-of-living crises, the food bank set up called community cupboard.

How the school is a great asset in the community and how it is striving to
help every pupil.

There are 2 other schools on the shortlist both Primary. There was a total
of 10 schools that had either put a nomination in or a third party had
nominated them. Hope this helps.

If you have any more questions, please get in touch.

Wendy Harrington wants access to the parent governor nomination form which
Carrie set up as a Google form and is the document named in the title of
the email.

I can get access as Carrie gave me access but Wendy can't open it. I've
screenshot the responses in case no one else can access it.

"","","Year 12 teachers email list","Hi,

It turns out that neither of our Year 12 Spanish teachers has been included on the all.y12teachers list, and they have therefore not been getting any of the emails! Please could you add them (a.matoses and j.fletcher), and make sure that James is included for next year's Y13 list?

Laura, I've forwarded the messages about the UCAS references, but if there's anything else that you need them to have now, could you possibly resend it to them please?

Thanks,

Hi

RE: Rachael Lewis, Teacher of English starting in September

Jen Shires has asked if she can have email address and Classcharts & SIMs log-in ahead of time so that she can get started over the summer.

She has passed all her recruitment and safeguarding checks, so I presume if I do a start date of next Monday on her SIMs account this would enable these access to happen?

Please confirm.

Also Claire, Rachael wants to come in over the summer holidays.  Will she be able to get in to school - I don't know what the access arrangements are over the holidays.

Thanks

Susan

Understanding the Razor and Blade Business Model - StartUp Mindset

are many different types of business models available for a business to
choose from. The razor and blade business model has been around for over a
century and is still one of the most successful types. It’s a simple
concept: sell something cheap at first but make money by selling customers
additional products and services down the road. Although the business model
is over 100 years old, it is still a profitable one.

Before using the Razor and Blade Business Model over others, let’s look at
the aspects of this model.

The Razor and Blade Business Model is a business model in which a company
sells a product or service at a low price (razor), then makes money by
selling customers replacement parts or accessories (blades) at high prices.

We are wanting to use the Clipchamp software on the children's Chromebooks so that they can produce a video as part of their Computing work. We used this really successfully 2 years ago.

Can you make it clear on this email that the person is a trustee as we have
two R.Thompsons.

Can you also confirm whether it would be a problem to start putting first
names on new email addresses. I find it really difficult when I want to
write to someone and don't know their surname. Also, we are still getting
breaches where things are being sent to the wrong email address especially

world is loud and full of interruptions, from the phone buzzing in your
pocket to the garbage truck backing up outside your window. It’s rare to
find yourself in an environment that is totally tranquil — rarer still to
be in a head space where you’re able to dissolve into that bubble of peace.
I crave this feeling, which I associate with sitting in a darkened eye
doctor’s office, listening to the soft click of the phoropter. I think of
doing homework alone in the dining room of a childhood piano teacher’s
house on winter evenings, waiting for my sister to finish her lesson. Or,
more recently, of the windowless phone booths in the newsroom where I used
to work, which I’d sometimes use not to conduct an interview but to sit on
the floor when I was feeling overwhelmed.

The trouble with these real-life spaces is that the bubble will inevitably
burst. The eye exam will end. It will be your turn for the piano lesson,
and it will emerge that you absolutely did not practice last week. You will
grow paranoid that your boss has clocked your absence from your desk. A
library is perhaps the ideal version of a physical space that is peaceful
in the way I’m chasing: It’s definitionally quiet, and if you don’t have
too much going on, you can stay for as long as you want, or at least until
it closes.

There is another avenue for finding environments that have a swaddling
effect on the mind, and that is the sprawling and wildly popular world of
ASMR videos on YouTube. ASMR stands for Autonomous Sensory Meridian
Response, a term coined in 2010 to describe a pleasant brain-tingling
feeling that some people experience when exposed to triggers like tapping
fingernails, crinkling fabric and whispered conversation. Many ASMR videos
involve role play, with a YouTuber taking on a specific identity to
simulate a one-on-one prom-dress fitting or lice check. While ASMR videos
can prompt that nice prickly feeling, they have the broader aim of soothing
viewers, many of whom often watch them as a stress-management tool or sleep
aid.

One of our phones (number 3324 in Meeting Room 4) isn't producing any
audio, I've tried swapping the handset and the cable that connects it to
the phone, however it still isn't working. This includes the tone that
normally plays when you pick the handset up. The phone is definitely on! Is
there anything I could have missed here?

"","","GDPR audit queries","Hello

We have our GDPR audit coming up.  Please could you advise on the following
so we have our answers ready?


   - Are our laptops encrypted
   - Do you do any emonitoring through the smoothwall? If so is there any
   GDPR paperwork you can send me (we don't seem to have a copy of the
   broadband contract)
   - how often are backups taken?
   - how long are those backups available for?
   - where do you store the backups?
   - do you test the backups regularly to ensure they do restore?

Thank you

"","","New Account Request","Good Afternoon,

Could I request a new PMAT account be set up for Sue Wrenn please. Sue will
be undertaking a dual role as School Business Manager at Huntington Primary
(Sue already has a HPA email address for this role) and also a central PMAT
role.
Sue would like to keep both accounts separate please (no diverts) and needs
to be set up as part of the CST.
As Sue's role develops she may need access to additional drives but we will
request these as required.

Thanks so much,
Sarah

RE: Rachael Lewis, Teacher of English starting in September

Jen Shires has asked if she can have email address and Classcharts & SIMs log-in ahead of time so that she can get started over the summer.

She has passed all her recruitment and safeguarding checks, so I presume if I do a start date of next Monday on her SIMs account this would enable these access to happen?

Please confirm.

Also Claire, Rachael wants to come in over the summer holidays.  Will she be able to get in to school - I don't know what the access arrangements are over the holidays.

Thanks

Further to my phone call ....
My current email is apennick@nep.pmat.academy
On Friday I finish working at New Earswick as EY Lead but am moving to EY
lead for Pathfinder.  Initially a second email had been set up
apennick1@pmat.academy though I am still unable to access this despite
Holly changing my password back to Winter2023.
It's really important I still have access to my Google drive/old emails and
calendar, so if the account could just be renamed as we discussed that
would be amazing!

Thank you!

I'm not sure what work is going on during the summer holidays in
the Pathfinder Suite but please can it be ready and in working order from
w/c 28th August as we have trainees coming in towards the end of that week.

Please can someone also look at the blinds in the suite over the summer?
The cord doesn't seem to work so we have to pull them open and shut.

I am hoping that you may be able to help us as one of our teacher's has
mentioned that since we swapped over to the new laptops in September they
no longer have Active Inspire installed, the teaching staff are currently
using the online version of this but it doesn't have the same functionality
as the installed version.

Could you please look into installing this onto all of our laptops?  I have
copied in Miss Bedda as she is the lead on this for the school and may be
able to answer any questions about the software.

I’ve added pics below to show you what messages come up when I try and log
on to a desktop computer. When I am logged on I’m restricted to what I can
do and see. Google is also ‘paused’ when I’m on a desktop. Not sure if
that’s due to being restricted but it means I can’t access my emails or any

I can access emails and drive and login fine on a chrome book and my phone.

Also my login on Integris doesn’t work.

"","","Access to youtube on teacher computers","Hello,
This Wednesday(12 July), we have nineteen visitors arriving at school to
deliver a fantastic year 12 Philosophy, Theology and Ethics Enrichment day.
These visitors have been informed that they can not use USB sticks on
the day. Therefore, some have forwarded their powerpoint presentations by
email to me, so that they can be accessed on the day by the RE teacher that
will be allocated to their session. I have noticed that some of these
powerpoint presentations have got links in them for Youtube clips and when
I have tried them out in Re3 it says that Youtube is not currently
available on this device. Is this the same for the sixth form rooms? The
sessions will be in L16, L25, L32, L33, L34, Sixth Form Library, Sixth Form
Cafe and also in the main hall. I understand that Sarah Walton is planning
on setting up a laptop to show a powerpoint in the Sixth Form Cafe as there
is no computer. I want to be absolutely sure that our visitors will be able
to access the resources/clips they have prepared - Please can you add
youtube access for these rooms (even if it is just for the day) if they do
not have it already. Also, could there be anyone on hand on Wednesday
morning to troubleshoot if necessary?

"","","Filtering and monitoring","Hello

As you can see below a snippet from the Keeping Children Safe in Education, we require clarity and understanding on filtering and monitoring online pupil activity at Yearsley Grove Primary School.  Also, if any inappropriate sites accessed or tried to be accessed could link as an alert to CPOMs that would be ideal.

I believe that a number of schools may ask for this information as there has been an update.


The 2023 KCSIE updates also provides guidance in the form of new instructions and recommendations regarding online filtering and monitoring software to keep tabs on what sites pupils are visiting or trying to visit.

Three notable changes in the guidance state that:

·        Designated safeguarding leads (DSL) are responsible for understanding the filtering and monitoring systems each school has in place. This means that DSLs need to take the time to understand the kinds of websites students are visiting, for example.

·        “An understanding of the expectations, applicable roles and responsibilities in relation to filtering and monitoring” should be included in safeguarding and child protection training at induction for all staff.

·        Each school’s child protection policy should include how appropriate filtering and monitoring technology on school devices and school networks form part of its policies.

Safeguarding software<https://www.cpoms.co.uk/cpoms-safeguarding-software/> like CPOMS can be integrated with some of the UK’s highly trusted web filtering and monitoring service providers, such as classroom.cloud<https://classroom.cloud/>, Securus<https://www.securus-software.com/>, Senso<https://senso.cloud/gb/>, and Smoothwall<https://www.smoothwall.com/education/filter/> to ensure that if a child uses an inappropriate search term or tries to access an inappropriate website using the school’s network for example, designated safeguarding leads can be notified using the software’s automated process.

Tim has forwarded this to me, as some time ago we completed a site walk and
some documentation with Chris Adamson.  This came back with a form to
complete about the network assets?
Are you able to support us with this please, as it is all very technical?
The document we need support with is the CTC_2023_NetworkAssetForm.

I'm unsure whether we've missed the boat on this now, but I wasn't aware
there was anything else to complete, and Tim has just looked back and seen
this.

Good afternoon Tim,



Thank you for your email.



However, I will need to return these documents to you, as before we can
process these, we need the Network Asset Form (NAF) returned for review
before you would receive confirmation of acceptance onto the program
together with a procurement pack.



A NAF document was last sent to you on 28/04/2023 at
admin.braeburn@ebor.academy. I have also attached a blank NAF for again.



Please can you complete/ have completed the NAF and send back to us ASAP.



Please return the quote and technical documents once you have received
confirmation of acceptance.



Many thanks,



                                    Regards

You have an account that was previously set up. If you try these details first:

Username: nmorrell
Password: Autumn2021

If you remember changing your password before, try that too. If you are not sure, let me know and I will ask Vital to reset. If they do that, you will have to log in on school grounds first time.

The shared area is about to be archives as we move to cloud based work. Everything is, or will be soon, available via Teams or sharepoint. You have access to Staff Notice Board, which already has all reports, assessments, schemes of work/learning maps, policies, etc., plus the cover and events of the week and annual calendar. Doobori will go through the finer details with you.

"","","Office changes","From R McNair <r.mcnair@mce.hslt.academy>: Hi

There are to be some office changes over the summer to be ready for
September :

Tom and Paul into the Cover Supervisors' office.
Denise into Tom and Paul's office.
Andrew into the MFL office without a door.
Me into Andrew's office.
Kathy and Alison into the WDT office

This means the following will be come meeting rooms :

Kathy and Alison's
Denise's
Mine.

I'll look at furniture requirements - it'll become clearer what we've got
when we start moving everything around.

I would think all the offices are good to go for their new occupants in
terms of power and data, but please could you check.  The issue we're going
to have is with Andrew's new room.  He's going to need :

additional power points
data points (there aren't any at the moment) - computer, phone
hooking up to the printer in the MFL workroom
a door with a vision panel in it.

We might need to get together and have a proper discussion about this.

Thanks
Rachael

happening again (has been fine since May when Craig fixed it - I've used it

Good morning Giles,

Hope you're well.

I've spoken with Aspire Academy this morning, they are unable to import a CTF from another school due to known error at the moment. The error is that if a school who are on the latest version of SIMS (7.212), and they're sending a CTF to a school on 7.210 then they are unable to import the CTF.

Do you have a date/time we can schedule the SIMS upgrade for Aspire please? and if so, can you send some connection details across please. I think they're happy for it be any evening after 4pm.


Many Regards,

Sam Newton,

I've been chatting to the lovely Charlotte about our computing curriculum

staff how to use Google Classroom. The teacher view is different from the
student view, so I would like to set up a demo Badger Hill pupil account to
allow teachers to model things in Google Classroom. Would you be able to do
that for me?

Hi Aiden,

Aspire do not plan on setting up the FFT Aspire Data Exchange at this time,
thank you.

Russell Goodwin does not work at Aspire Academy but Chris Mulqueen does so
please can he remain on as a user.

I will pass on the Data recovery Service information to our IT provider to

"","","Laptops for Computing specialist teachers","Morning

I just wondered if it would be possible for the Computing teachers to have
their Windows laptops back before the summer?

The teachers are:

   - Myself
   - Barrie Cracknell
   - Kat Stephenson

Please can these have installed the same software as requested for the
teacher stations so the teachers can practice using the required software
over the summer holidays?

Thanks

We have an account (user=tsports) we use for external lettings. I think one

Any chance you could reset the password (or send me a link to do so)?

Also, please could you tell me how the loaning of BeeBots works that you offer? It would be good to maybe book them in for Summer 1 term next year.

Some of the children in St G's use voice typing to support their work in
English. We'd like to use it in Google Slides, but the standard slides
setup just allows voice typing in the speaker notes, not in text boxes on
the actual slides.

I found an Alice Keeler recommended add-on that solves the problem - please
can you install it for us? When I looked for it the message I got was ""This
application is not allowed by your administrator.""

Useful for everyone, so unless it causes a problem applying it to all users
would be good! We're hoping to use it on Tuesday...

"","","Chromebook","Hi there

I have received this message from our Computing Lead today;

This chromebook has preset @osb.ebor.academy at sign in (instead of
asj.ebor.academy) tried powerwashing but no change.  Staff can change it
and log in but children's accounts don’t work on it.
I have attached the details from the back of the chromebook and Mat thinks
that the licence has been
somehow transferred to Osbaldwick?

I actually asked a student to send this as we had a lot to get through….
Sorry about that.

Ultimately the projector went off 4 times during period 4 then stayed on
during period 5. Please can it be checked so then hopefully is more
reliable next week.

Thank you.

"","","Calendar","We hare having problems with thing loading on to the calendar on the
website I emailed Andrew and he suggested this

No problem, there are a few steps/things to consider.
1. Decide on which calendar will be made public. Sounds daft but note
this must be only for the public so no staff entries etc.
2. Get your IT support to make the chosen calendar available publicly.
3. Send me the iframe embed code for that calendar (probably just ask the
IT person for it).
4. I'll embed the calendar into the website using that code and it will
automatically show any entries on the website.


Is this something you can update for me

Hi

Is there any chance I could get my new laptop now PLEASE 😊

I can’t use mine at all now and have brought it back onsite today as I have ‘0’ bytes available (I couldn’t even open my emails yesterday) ☹ ☹☹

Thanks

Subject: IT changes for September

Hi Adam & Marcus,

Following on from our meeting last week, I said I would send across our ‘wish list’ for September. A few things we talked about were:


  1.  Every pupil to have their own log in for the PC’s, this will be linked to their email passwords (not able to change the password) You generate the email password and we would like that to be the same for the PC as we have a record for when they forget it 😊


  1.  Dispose of Pupil DG 2, 3 4, log on and store any data on server (Temporarily) until Sam can go through and delete what is not necessary



  1.  Email distribution list – for us to be able to amend when necessary (possibly by using groups, possibly showing Sam how to do this)



  1.  Create a profile for “Complete Maths only” so pupils are not able to access anything else.



A few things since our meeting after discussion with Chris, headteacher

I know the plan was to move everything from the ‘shared drive’ over to google at some point but this never happened………..So I’m thinking that we could do this over the Summer ready for September.


  *   Move the ‘U’ drive over and give access to all staff


  *   Move the ‘V’ drive over and give access to those that are already allocated access



  *   Move the ‘S’ drive over in October. From September we will get students to safe their work in their own google drive by the End of September (this will then prevent them constantly deleting folders from the ‘S’ drive which has happened quite a lot this academic year!!



  *   Create a Visitor log in which only SLT can give to visitors when necessary



We are going to send this information out to staff on Friday this week in our bulletin.



If you think any of this is not possible in the time scales can you let me know so I can amend the information to staff or if you have any queries please don’t hesitate to contact me.

Many thanks

Lynn

"","","Old Interactive white board","Good morning

We got some new interactive white boards installed from Elementary through Vital, which have been greatly appreciated. Usually Vital has then collected the legacy equipment for some sort of recycling, but we still have one old interactive whiteboard left in the office. Is it at all possible for this is be collected?

Best wishes

"","","T6 and T8 Projectors","I mentioned issues with Art 4 this week and you let me know that its being
redone in the summer...thought I would check about the projectors in the
food rooms....
We have complained about the quality of these for YEARS now....they are
very difficult to see and you can only show anything with all lights off
and its still not very good quality.  Are these being sorted this summer
too?

We had an event at The Leyes in the main hall which needed to make use of
the audio system. Although it was clear, the sound seemed only to be coming
from the back of the room - the projector, even, possibly?

I couldn't hear anything from the speakers in the ceiling? Could you (or is
it Elementary?) come and check it out please? Thursday or Friday best for
me although I suppose I don't really need to be here.

"","","2D Design files showing as 0kb on J drive","Good morning.

Mrs Hardy has a class of 2D design files on J drive- see link below.

All files show 0kb, therefore no CAD file present, although an icon is
present. See screenshot below of the drive image.

It is also showing that the students cannot save to J drive in G2 on the
screens.

The only way that I can get access to the students' work is for them to
email me their CAD file. Then I download it, open it, and then copy it into
my area and then add it onto 2D Design.

Can we please find a more efficient solution, so that students can save
their work to a drive that staff can access.

"","","Emily Tucker can't login to her PPA laptop","Hi Emily,

I managed to login (with my account) fine and checked internet
working on that laptop (SPS-LAP02).

I think there could be an issue with your account, something similar
happened
to Mr Lockwood. i.e. he could login fine on some computers but not others.

I think David's accounts needed a password reset plus there was a sync
issue on intune : ""the user doesn't come up in endpoint""

I've included Vital on this as they will be able to check and reset
passwords etc if needed.

thanks

"","","Urgent - laptop fault","Good morning

I am increasingly frustrated with the new laptop I received a few weeks ago
which is causing me great problems. I raised a ticket a few days after
receiving it as it wouldn’t link to many of external sites . A new drive
was fitted .
The current problem is that it doesn’t recognise when I’m at school ! I
reboot , I change the proxy but it is slow , it won’t connect to the
internet and when it does it’s painfully slow .

The shield on the bottom right hand corner has a yellow exclamation mark -
photo attached as to show reason .

I am arriving at work at 6.00am to try and get caught up most days . Having
no internet is causing me great stress . Please can this be fixed asap ?

Thanks in advance

"","","Second monitor","Hi

I've spoken to a couple of people about getting a second monitor in Rachel Wilson's office, as I'll be in there as Head of Year from Sept. And I've been told you're the person to ask. So - please could I get a second monitor like the heads of year in lower school ready for Sept?
Rach is fine with it being put in now.

Thanks!

In the first 2 weeks in Sept, Year 7 and Year 8 students will be
completing their STAR reading tests on chromebooks.

Can I check with you that:
- the new Year 7 cohort will have their IT logins at the start of Sept?
-the Y8 Sept cohort already have logins and these will work as normal in
Sept
-as we've done in the past, we are able to borrow from you at least 10
chromebooks to top up the English chromebook trolley so we have enough for
a class of 32.

Afternoon All

Unfortunately we need to re-room you on Tuesday 11th July and Thursday 13th July for an employability event. We would usually use p rooms - however those teacher have already been moved several times this year AND we have Arts Fest approaching

I've done my best to keep each teacher in the one room or rooms that are very close by.

I appreciate your co-operation.

Any issues just shout.

"","","Chromebooks & impereo","From G Taylor <g.taylor@gra.hslt.academy>: Hi

I am trying to monitor the students in my room using chromebooks but I
cannot distinguish on impereo between those students elsewhere in school
and those in my class.

The system used to be set up so that the chromebooks were in groups (as in
Trolley A maths chromebooks, Trolley B maths chromebooks etc) so that you
could just monitor the group of chromebooks that you had. However this is
not the case anymore and they are all clumped together in a big group.

Please can you advise how to do this as at the moment it is showing 63
chromebooks in use around school and less than a dozen are in my class.

Thanks, Georgie

Dear Compass + administrator(s) for Manor Church of England Academy

We are writing to you because we have been unable to get in touch with your
IT Manager.

To continue using Compass +, we need your IT Manager to change your MIS
connection from Assembly to Groupcall.

Your IT Manager does not need access to Compass+ to do this. We need the C+
admin users to do the following:

Please could you visit this page on Compass +:
MIS Integration
<https://02ohy.mjt.lu/lnk/AVYAAB0c2LMAAAAAAAAAAAoR-PgAAAAAXzgAAAAAABvDagBkpVQZtqWB2R5gQjGPkbp0BqtB-gAannA/1/bGu4xS3ThZDONY30kIyaXQ/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb21wYXNzcGx1cy5jYXJlZXJzYW5kZW50ZXJwcmlzZS5jby51ay9taXMtaW50ZWdyYXRpb24>

Where you can, if necessary, update the contact details of your IT Manager
and then send them an automated email by clicking on the button that begins
“Update to XoD”. This will allow them to update your MIS connection.

Kind Regards

this is the 'virtual' meet the dell team activity I mentioned for y10

shown in the email below.
I will ensure the student surveys are ready for students the following
mornings form time session so don't worry about this.

Adam - I am hoping you will go along to the hall and support this session
too...(you will have other y10 teacher in the hall too)

We will need to try and support students to develop some appropriate
questions for the dell team...I have warned them we would not be able to
prepare in advance because of mock exams.

ISSUE - it does say to sign on at 1.40...with the DELL team to check its
working...Dan you may not be able to do that... IT support can you help?
Adam can you help earlier?
thanks all....I'm sure we can make this work.

Louise and the guest speakers from Dell will join from 13:40 ready for a
prompt 13:55 start. We would encourage you to join the meeting link before
this time to iron out any tech issues, however you will be kept in the
waiting room until the start time of 13:55.



We would like to have as many students interacting with the volunteers as
possible during the session so that is *conversational* and not just a
webinar format. *Please could you ensure camera/microphones are enabled for
the session. *



*Ask students to prepare questions! *



Please ask your students to prepare a range of up to 20 questions for the
guest speakers from Dell ahead of the session.



*Please send these questions to us (**robyn.cummings@talentfoundry.org.uk*
<robyn.cummings@talentfoundry.org.uk>*), one working day before the session
via email*. We want to make sure as many questions as possible can be
covered so this will help us plan enough time for questions to be answered.




There will also be plenty of opportunity during the session to ask
questions.



*Student surveys*



You will find attached student surveys to be printed in advance of the
session and returned via post to The Talent Foundry (address included in
the attached logistics pack). If you would prefer for students to complete
the survey online, please notify us in advance and ensure that the full
cohort will be completing this (accessed here -
https://survey.zohopublic.com/zs/NlRl7X ).



Alternatively, students can also be shown a QR code on screen towards the
end of the session which will allow them to complete the survey on their
personal devices if they have one.  If you would prefer to do this, please
let us know in advance.



*Please reply to this email as soon as possible to confirm there are no
changes to the arrangements for the session*



Any further questions please don’t hesitate to get in touch. We are very
much looking forward to it!



Best wishes,

Robyn

"","","Fwd: HSLT PURCHASE ORDER REQUEST TEMPLATE","Hello

I wonder if you can assist with this issue please.

We use this email order template, as shown below, across the schools within
the Trust so that they can forward their requisitions to orders@hslt email
who then process the order on our finance system and send it off to the
supplier.
We have been advised of an issue with the screen justification on the order
template for S. Mitchell (who I have copied in) as it is causing her
problems to complete it.
It is not aligning on her screen and she is having to scroll backwards and
forwards across her screen rather than it showing as it does for me in this
email within the whole screen.

We think this is an isolated issue but wonder if there is anything we can
do to manage it please - is it anything to do with the email screen set up
or the computer resolution etc?

Please could you look at this for us?

Thanks.

"","","Re: Email addresses for new starters","Hi both,

While Amy's enthusiasm is laudable, she should not have access to her Ebor
account until she is officially an employee.

Planning should be possible without access to an Ebor email and access to
the drives should not be in place until after an employee's start date.

Vital - can you please remove access for Amy?

Dave, can you please explain to her it's a safeguarding issue?

TIA

Hi Jake,
I hope you're doing well! Today two of the students in ERP were playing
bloxd.io, which seems to basically be a free version of Minecraft. I see
that there is a chat feature, so I spoke to Lucy and we want to see about
getting it blocked to avoid any issues that the chat could cause. Do you
know if that is possible?
All the best,

Hi
Please could someone remove the apps in the screenshot from my iPad? I’m struggling for storage and getting more and more glitches because I don’t have room for iOS updates anymore. They must be pre-installed by Vital as they just come back whenever I try to delete them.
Thanks very much

Dear Isabel



I have now actioned your resignation from the LGC and will ask the school
to close down your PMAT account. It has been great to work with you and I
hope our paths cross again at some point!



On behalf of the Governance Service at City of York Council, thank you for
the time you have spent as a Governor at Archbishop Holgate’s School.




I appreciate that the role of a governor has changed significantly over
recent years and is very challenging. As you know, governors play a vital
part in helping improve our schools and academies and I hope that you have
found the experience rewarding.



We always welcome, and take seriously, feedback from governors relating to
their experience of both their role and the support offered by the
Governance Service. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you would like
to make any comments or observations.



Although you are no longer a governor at the school, please do continue to
respect the confidentiality of the LGC’s business. Please dispose of any
governor related papers that you may still have access to in an appropriate
way.



If in the future you feel you would like to make use of the knowledge and
experience you have gained and become a governor again please do not
hesitate to get in touch with us.



With very best wishes

Barbara

Hi,

On Thursday my board/projector started turning itself off and it has done
this again a lot on Friday which made teaching very difficult. I cleaned
out the filter as it was making an 'overheating' noise and then
turning itself off after a few minutes of being on but it continued to do
it even after I cleaned the filter.
Any other thoughts or could VITAL come and look as soon as possible?
Thanks so much,
Sara

Hi Rikki,

I’m hoping you’re the right person to email!

I received a reminder from Calum Kimm today with a forwarded email from
Kristina Hill. However, I didn’t receive the original email.

Please could you check I'm included in the all teachers email?

Thanks,
Julia

Hi all

Just a reminder that the Yr 7, 8 and 9 data (from the endpoint tests) is
due in on SIMS/Edulink *no later than 3:00 pm on 3/7.*

We are collecting a score out of 50 and an ATL Score, as outlined below,
where we assign
5 to Outstanding
4 to Good
3 to RI
0-2 Poor (we are adjusting this for next year so it is 1 digit only)

Please attempt to assess absent students the following couple of lessons;
please enter -1/50 for persistent absentees.

Scripts can be DIRTED but the standard scores will be shared with students
in official celebration assemblies before the summer.

Thanks in advance for all the work that goes into this.

Please can teachers remember to keep the scripts safe as we will need them
for standardisation; ELT will receive invites in due course.

Finally, please can I flag up the importance of meeting this deadline. *We
must report to students and parents before the summer.* We cannot
standardise if the deadline is not met; this, in turn, would put us back on
standardising and issuing of report cards.

Thanks all in advance,

Kristina

As per our conversation yesterday I was wondering if there was any chance
of borrowing a device this weekend in London?

I am hoping this will make things easier in case of having to fill in
documents. I will have my own phone to use as a device if this is not
possible and for internet connection.

Thanks

"","","Google sheet ownership","Morning James,
We are looking to find a workaround to an issue regarding the shared
Markbooks in SEptember.
Currently, we have me as the 'owner' but this means Joanne cannot edit the
protected ranges if required (without me passing over ownership).
We are looking at how this could be impacted by illness....

Could we have a data@ahs.pmat.academy email account with us in it, that we
could use to be 'owner', thus allowing us both access????

Any other ideas greatly received!

"","","Computer not connecting to board","Hi there,

In Y5 Owls at FOG we have had some issues connecting our computer to the
interactive white board - at least one or two technicians have been in to
try to fix it. Last time it appeared to be fixed but as soon as the
computer was turned off and then on again the connection was lost and
unable to be reestablished. Is there anything else we can do?

Thanks,
Beth

"","","Y7 GL assessments this morning","Good morning,

A reminder that it is our Y7 progress tests in English and maths today in
the IT rooms.

Schedule attached FYI.

*IMPORTANT*:
Students must complete the assessments under normal assessment conditions,
in silence. They must try their best and not rush.

Students must not be permitted to start the next assessment outwith the
time scheduled. If individuals finish their assessment early, they may read
their book.

When the assessment time is over and if there is still lesson time left,
students may use the computers to access Mathswatch, Seneca, Sam Learning,
or Google Classroom work.

Thank you all for your support with these important progress tests. As
always, any questions, please let me know.

Catherine

We have a projector in class 1JJ where the bulb has gone again. This is
about the 3rd time. We don't want to keep replacing the bulb as it seems
there must be a problem with the projector. Someone did have a quick look
on Monday and just said it must be because it gets hot in this weather but
this projector isn't on for very long and always switched off when not in
use.

Please can you send someone to have a look.

"","","Two things","Hi

A couple of things;

Firstly, I really need my desktop printer sorting - despite various people
telling me it should work and various people from Vital trying - it
doesn't!! Vicky and I have been left on Chrome here in our office and the
printer does not like chrome - it cannot find the correct model number to
connect to.  I print off very confidential stuff which prints out on the
copier in the middle of other peoples large jobs - today something
highly confidential almost got thrown away in a normal paper bin which
would have had huge GDPR implications.

Secondly, I cannot open Excel documents on chrome - HR wants me to
print our documents for signature - the Google version of the
document prints on 4 pages all over the place instead of 1 page and if I
download it to an Excel it wont let me open it to print it.

6 months of working on chrome, dodgy printing and learning completely new
skills is taking its toll particularly at this highly busy time of year
with so many staff changes

Can someone get life back to normal for me please????

Thanks

"","","Ipads full storage message","Hi Vital,

We have a couple more IPADS which keep bringing up a full storage message.
We get the full storage message then other messages which  just
keep flashing up saying unable to update each app in turn. We have already
sent 2 or 3 ipads where this has happened to you to be wiped recently but
now other ipads are having the same problem - at least another couple more.
We are worried that this is something which will affect all the ipads in
school. Is there anything that may be causing this on our ipads? Will they
all need to be wiped? and if so can we wait till summer to do this?

The ipads which have this issue are at another of our sites so they
won't be at mainsite until tomorrow if you need to collect them.

Thank you

Amy

"","","Staff iPads @ Badger Hill","Good afternoon Vital!

I've heard that the staff iPads at Badger Hill are being collected later
this week to be updated (?) and I wondered if we could request some help
pairing these with the Smartboards in the classrooms? Ideally we'd have the
iPads labelled so that they'd stay in the classes (rather than move with
the teachers) and we'd like to be able to share the iPads' screens on the
Smartboards.

Hope that makes sense and that you're able to help!

Many thanks,

"","","Help!","Morning, I am in SFX Office and for some reason no emails at all are coming
through to me today, I'm usually included in the 'Reception' group. Could
you check as I'm having a particularly peaceful day!
Also, whilst I'm on to you if you had another mouse could I swap it as mine
keeps sticking and vanishing!

Kind regards,

Janet

Kirsten,

What he needs to make sure is that every student and teacher has a school
email address on the system. I attach a guide about bulk uploading email
addresses. Normally, IT can provide you with a list of emails in a .csv
file if all students and teacher have them and then it just needs uploading.

Help is also available online:https://simsbulkimport.uk/ or if still
struggling can contact SIMS directly or I can get wonde to contact your
data manager to assist.

I received a new laptop yesterday and it worked in the office but is not
working at home - when I log on it is just a black screen with this pc and
recycle bin showing. The error message says 'Windows can't find a computer
or device named ""EBOR-DATA01' .
I have pressed 'windows +r' to see chrome but need to be in schools this
afternoon so I wondered if you would be able to look at it this morning ? I
will be at The Leyes from 9.00-12.15 if that helps.

I'm so sorry to keep nagging about this but I just got a notification
saying I have used 80% of my data for the month. I have no issue with using
it but it is likely to run out in the next day or so.

I now have details for my email account but still no windows username or
password to enable me to get into the computer in the first place. I spoke
to the IT guy this morning who brought me my email details and he said it
would be soon but not sure when.

I just wanted to warn you before it actually ran out!

I am struggling to access the internet on the caretakers ipad.  I am also
told that staff also have problems accessing the internet on the classroom
ipads.

Rob - we had a discussion about how we could access the Inventry app so
that in an emergency we can take a device out with us.  I have tried to the
old ipads and cannot access the app store so think they are too old.
Although could this be because we can't access the internet.

The thought now rather than using personal phones is to have the app on the
caretakers ipad which is stored in the office.

Please can you help.
