Hi Claire,

I can understand your frustration! I'm afraid we can't do anything on our end as it will be your school's firewall that is blocking the video, you will need to speak to your IT department about unblocking it.

elsewhere in Pathfinder as one is the Head of a different school and
another is on the central team.  I understand from a member of the central

I went down to 166MB of 117GB available on the Google Drive, which has

Drive.

However, when I look at the properties just of My Drive, it is only 18.8GB.
I am not sure what else to remove/edit/change in order to free up more
space overall.
Is it possible to get some more storage as 1.45 GB won't be enough for this

need this added to my account and then she can talk me through how to

2. No Activ - can this also be added?

3. Lost access to S drive at New Earswick since logging in to this laptop.

"","","authenticator","Hi.

Jamie here from New Earswick.

I got a new phone over the summer and I'm just having an issue setting the
authenticator app up on it for 2 step verification. It's asking for a qr
code, but I can't seem to find it on my emails or find out where I can
access it on my google account. I've been able to access my emails by using
the app on my old phone for now, but going forward, I'd like to get it
sorted on my new phone.

Hope that makes sense?
You can call me if that's easier.

"","","New computer","Hi James,

Just familiarising myself with the new computers. I think the one I have on my desk is still updating but that one and the one on the library desk will need SIMS installing.

Hope that is ok but let me know if I need to do anything. I am in school today until 10.30am and will be in tomorrow all morning.

Thank you

You’re receiving this email because we have detected a critical alert on one of your AadSyncService instances.

Title:

Description:
Synchronization to Azure Active Directory appears to have been stopped for at least 24 hours. As a result, data in Azure AD may not be up-to-date.

Recommended action
There is a latency in processing this message for up to 24 hours, so you should verify the current state of your synchronization service. If synchronization is happening as expected, you can ignore this message.
Azure AD Connect synchronization scheduler might be unable to schedule the next sync cycle if Azure AD Connect Wizard is open in the background. It shares the same MUTEX with the scheduler. Make sure the Wizard is closed once any change is done.
Try to restart Microsoft Azure Active Directory Sync Services.
Any synchronization operations that are currently running will be interrupted. You can choose to perform below steps when no synchronization operation is in progress.
1. Click Start, click Run, type Services.msc, and then click OK.
2. Locate Microsoft Azure AD Sync, right-click it, and then click Restart.

knew this would happen so I sorted all my photos stored in Google photos
from that account into folders and shared it with my new Google account.All
those folders have now vanished.Is there any chance you could reactivate
the account for a short period while I back up pictures that I need to
save. There are lots I need for evidence of work done in school in the last
few years. Alternatively, is there a way of merging the two Google photo
accounts?Many thanksDan JonesSt Wilfrid’s*

"","","Handwriting font","Morning,

I think Michelle Moneypenny may have already sent an email but I just
wanted to check.

It seems that a handwriting font hasn't been migrated over which means that
docs and SMART resources all need to be updated. I can't actually
remember the exact name of the handwriting programme but it started with an
""X"" on the drop down menu in fonts.

I am pretty sure the programme was a shortcut on most laptops too.

It would be great if this could be installed back on all laptops asap as
it's a font that teachers use to prepare lots of resources.

Many thanks

Good day,

Please could you kindly reseat the cable that's plugged into port 5 of the router at the bottom.
And please ensure all cables are seated thoroughly.
If you have, please may you confirm whether anyone has changed the cables?
Please may we also be provided with the sites access times and contact incase an engineer is needed to be dispatched but we'll keep in touch regarding that.

"","","Speakers in L8","Hi Holly
Thanks. I agree they are working, the problem is the low volume.
The volume cannot go loud enough for students to hear clearly (they
frequently ask for it to be louder, and its not possible to do this). I
have diagnosed hearing loss myself and I find that the speakers are unable
to go to an appropriate volume as required. Other classrooms have speakers
which work really well, such as sc2, which I was in last academic year.

I know these speakers are working, however they are inneffective and will
negatively impact my ability to teach classes. Please they replaced with
more effective speakers such as those found in sc2? Thank you so much for
your time.

Kind Regards,
Charlotte

I spoke with somebody earlier regarding the broadband and internet issues
Clifton with Rawcliffe school are currently having.

Talk Straight have requested: that you reseat the cables going from the
router to the NTU?
Once this has been completed, if the connection remains down, please could
you provide us with photos of the router and NTU on site?

I believe the reseating of the cables already took place last week when one
of your technicians visited site?

I have also attached many photos Claire (Headteacher) took last week -
please could you advise which of these are the router and NTU?

Many thanks,

Dear all,

Sorry to bother you over the holidays, but I just wondered if you could
help Iris with a wee problem? The classes for next year have been released
but Iris’s computer has broken with her Google classroom password saved on
it. Is there anyway one of you could very kindly help either send her
current password or send a password reset somehow? She feels v left out as
all her friends know which classes they are in next year and Iris is
desperate to know too and would be very grateful if you can help.

Iris’s login is:

Many thanks for your help and hope you are all enjoying your holidays!

Dear all,

Sorry to bother you over the holidays, but I just wondered if you could
help Iris with a wee problem? The classes for next year have been released
but Iris’s computer has broken with her Google classroom password saved on
it. Is there anyway one of you could very kindly help either send her
current password or send a password reset somehow? She feels v left out as
all her friends know which classes they are in next year and Iris is
desperate to know too and would be very grateful if you can help.

Iris’s login is:

Many thanks for your help and hope you are all enjoying your holidays!

across to 'replacement' monitors from BS1 great - if not, could you please
take a look at the left hand one - no idea what's wrong with it!

Alison (Bailey) is in today and has asked if it is possible to have a web
cam for her 2 screen set up (she sits directly opposite me).

It might be when Linsee is back in she decides she would like the 2 'big
monitors' that we gave to Liv, as she will be in more frequently than Liv
and she does more spreadsheet work - sorry if that means undoing anything
you have already done.  I'll talk to her when we get in in September rather
than put you to any extra trouble currently.

I am not in tomorrow so that would be a great day to do cabling.  Alison
has said it would be great if her mouse could reach further, likewise if
the two phones could have more 'give' in them to reach both desks that
would be great.

Really really appreciate everything you have done - thank you SO much!

Best wishes

Fiona

Callum,



Unfortunately, a member of staff at Cornwall Wildlife Trust was the victim of a phishing attack this morning, and the attacker then used the victims account to send out more phishing messages.  I’ve analysed the list and 77 of those emails went to Mounts Bay Academy so I thought I should contact you.



The details of the email are below, the infrastructure used by the attacker is flagged by Microsoft as being used for ‘Attacker in the Middle’ phishing, which is where the authentication by the victim is proxied by the attacker who can then steal authentication cookies, allowing them to bypass Multi-Factor Authentication.  If any of your accounts are compromised as well as revoking all existing login sessions and resetting the password, I would also check for recently added Multi-Factor methods, as those could be used to regain control of the account after the password is reset.



Email details

Sender: Lucy.Luck@cornwallwildlifetrust.org.uk

Subject: THE CORNWALL TRUST FOR NATURE CONSERVATION LIMITED

Date/time: 10th August 10:15am

Payload: an email attachment (EML file) links to a Word Online document which in turn links to a phishing URL (more details available if required).



Cheers

"","","No access to files","Good Morning,

I understand that on August 11,  our old @stael.smccat.org.uk email
addresses were disabled. I think that linked to this email domain was our
access to the shared drives and now we (some or all) currently do not have
access to these files. Is it possible that you could reinstate this access
as a matter of urgency?

I believe that the drive was *G:\Shared drives\SAY - Staff Share (Old
Server)*

From here staff were able to access the sub folders.

Please ring me  on 07900255636 if you need to contact me.

Best wishes,

Hi Ladies,

Just to confirm I've sent through the PO this week for Abby's laptop

Abby when it is ready to collect - all I will need is the serial number
when you get it for our inventory.

Thanks so much,

"","","Terrington Hall School - urgent request","Hi

Further to my call, the office franking machine has lost connection to the server and their technical support have checked connections and tell me it is the school firewall. Their instructions are as follows:

Make an allowance for Port 443
Needs to be open for both in and outbound traffic
Allow URL UK-meterservices.neopost.com
If this is already laid out, may need to create a new rule

The franking machine is plugged into a new socket numbered 6 under the office window but Dave (site manager) has just been informed that this may not be even be connected yet. Please can you clarify.

I have 200 envelopes that the Headmaster wants in the post to parents today, so I would be grateful for your urgent attention.

Best wishes

"","","Re: NHS Office","Hi Gaynor,

What information will they need to see please? Is it just contact details,
or will it go beyond that? I will need to get a data sharing agreement in
place to ensure we remain compliant with GDPR regulations.

What we will then do is get them access to SIMS via the remote desktop so
they can use their own laptops and give them a generic account for SIMS
with access restricted to what they need to view.

Thanks
Sam

"","","VYLHD - Applocker issue","Good morning all.

I need to have MuEditor & Bandlab Assistant working but due to the
Applocker GPO we have, I'm not able to get these to load.

The issue is that these two programs, run from the user\%appdata% part and
not from C:\Programs.

The way these two products work is annoying and there is no way to install
them to the C:\Programs section.

Is there any way we can edit the GPO to allow these two programs to run?

Unfortunately, I am unable to edit the Applocker Base Policy, so I am
unable to make changes and test this at present.

Best wishes,
Lee

Please could you enable / install Google Drive for Desktop on the St
Barnabas PCs/laptops - I tried to access it yesterday for Sophie Pomfret
but it wasn't installed and needed admin privileges to do this.

Please can you also add Sophie Pomfret to the printers at St Barnabas?  She

Hi,



We have to re image the machines that have the software installed and relocate the software into a different IT Suite.







I have gone though to deactivate all the licences to allow me to re instate them on new machine where it will be required for the next educational year.







Can you please deactivate all the remaining licences for me so i can fully re apply the licences to new machines.







Thanks

Please could you check whether James is going to get that Chromebook with
the damaged port replaced as part of the managed service as I never heard
back from the previous email.

If you could also clarify how many Chromebooks you are due to replace as
part of the managed service that would be helpful too. I have put some of
our other ones in the Chromebook trolleys around school so there are more
than 30 currently in these.

Do you know if there are any issues to why I can't type a sender's email

We have a box next to the photocopier at the office which has the following
in it:

-The computer to be put in the new nurture room which is through where the
new whiteboard was installed. It needs to be linked up to the whiteboard in
this room.

-The Ipad which needs to be replaced with the new one. Please can the new
one have the Dexcom app installed on it and be linked to the wifi.

-The laptop which is broken and needs to be looked at, needs to be imaged?

Do you know when you will be coming in to do the chromebooks in school?
They need changing for the new pupil email addresses, or can this be done
remotely?

Hope you have a lovely summer.

Many thanks,

"","","Computing Changes - Visit","Hi,

In the holidays, I believe that you are doing some updates. Please could you clarify the questions below or I could ring up and speak to Adam if that is better as I know he has spoken with Linda. I would appreciate it if you could help with the second question as that is my biggest concern after my experience previously.

Do you need all iPads throughout school collecting for when you come in? As I thought these were updated remotely or is all the data getting wiped?

Would there be any chance that some of the laptops could be updated this Friday to Windows 11? As it would make it easier to see the difference for myself as many staff are worried that they will be losing data. I had some issues before when I recently moved to this new laptop with missing data so I don't really want to be leaving my laptop over the summer holidays to then come back to loads of stuff missing off it.

Are the computers going to a fully cloud based? So does that mean that there won't be anything backed up on a server so everything needs to be put on the cloud before staff hand in their laptops.

Thanks,
David

"","","2nd new telephone","Hi

I believe Tamara has sent in a request for us to have a new telephone
installed in what used to be the photocopier room.

We would also like one in the room which used to be called Group room 4,
now known as the Hive.  We can show you where that is when someone comes to
have a look.

Kind regards

"","","School app - Apple developer","Hi there

Please can you let me know who mans the email address appledev@copmanthorpeprimary.co.uk?   Apparently an email has been sent to them to log in and renew the apple developer membership for our school app.

Thank you,

Kind regards

Hi there

Thanks for coming back to us.

I'm not sure who the appledev will go to - I'll check with IT!  Could the details be forwarded to this address please?

Thanks,

Kind regards

Hi Clare

Apple version
It looks like the school has not renewed its free Apple Developer membership (screenshot below). An email will have been sent to appledev@copmanthorpeprimary.co.uk<mailto:appledev@copmanthorpeprimary.co.uk> inviting you to login and renew. Until that's been done, Apple will hide your app.

<https://i.imgur.com/LjmebTT.png>Android version
We can still see the app in the version of Android we are using. However, it looks like the very latest version of Android does not support it. Let me investigate that and get back to you.

Kind regards

Graham

Hello there

We are still having problems with people downloading the app - both on iPhone and Android.

Apparently it doesn't show up in the app store on iPhone.

A parent has also sent in the below screenshot of their Android phone.

Is there anything we can do?

Hi there

Google were requesting some policy updates for the Android version of your app. I've completed these and have sent it for review. The review normally takes a few hours. Hopefully this will be sufficient to make the app available again, for now at least.

Kind regards

Graham
