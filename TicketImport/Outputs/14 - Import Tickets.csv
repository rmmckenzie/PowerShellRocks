The entire row of computers on the right side of the room in L40 have
network issues, where some kids can't log in at all and others can't access
work via Google Classroom - it's made my Arts Award lesson completely
impossible at a crucial time in the submission process. I know it has also
impacted music lessons earlier in the week and, when we have a full class
in, it makes it very difficult to ensure all students are making progress
and the classroom climate is manageable.

Please can this be addressed at the earliest opportunity.

Hi ! Could you advise ... want to order a scanner today. Checked that there
are no wireless ones in the library ... and old librarian certainly did not
mention one.
Because I am such a technophobe, would like your input here ... I need it
for moving around the library, and mainly for a stocktake which I may / may
not do...(one with no wire means I do not have to lug all the books to the
desk at the front!)

Dont need anything fancy - just one that can deal with our barcodes !
Want to order today as I only have a couple of days before the budgets
close for good !

Hi Andrew,



Apologies for pestering you with InVentry Central related things, but I’ve
had a look at the first five schools in the list and it appears the Central
URL is being blocked by a firewall or proxy.



We occasionally come across this scenario where IT Teams can look to
whitelist the URL or port which allows the communication.



To go over my tests though – it simply involves me checking the following
URL in a web browser on each school’s InVentry screen we’re due to link and
if a message of, “InventryCoreAPIService service is running and ready to
accept connections!” is displayed it will mean everything is ready for the
remote installation.



https://www.inventrycentral.co.uk:23214/status



I’ve been seeing the “Page cannot be reached” message though which usually
indicates a proxy for instance.



If you can kindly ask your IT team to take a look, please pass on my
details if they require any additional information about it.



I can then look to re-test whenever this has been done.



Please let me know if you have any questions though.



Thanks

Dave

Apologies for the late email but I wanted to check to see if it would be ok
for me to remotely access all of the schools in my previous list to see if
the Central URL for EBOR is communicating as it should please?



Once I’ve tested both the remote connections and the URL successfully I can
look to get all of them booked in for remote install – potentially next
week all being well.

Hi Andrew,



Sorry I forgot to list it.



https://training.inventry.co.uk/month?tags=677542758



Many thanks for the info – I believe we have all the relevant info we
require although my colleague has spoken with Tim about the three schools
we need to add on.



My colleague has just got back to me too about the central server so I know
the Central URL… This is the URL I’ll look to test in a web browser to
ensure communications are ok between the schools and InVentry Central.



https://www.inventrycentral.co.uk:23214/status



All being well if the above address is entered into a web browser it should
display a message advising the CORE API is running. On some occasions it
may be blocked by a firewall or proxy however if this is the case it will
usually present a “page cannot be found” type message and IT can usually go
about unblocking it.



If it’s ok, I’ll look to test a little later this evening if that’s ok –
after regular office hours to minimise potential disruption to the use of
the screen and will let you know how I get on.



Thanks

Dave

Thanks Dave,

There are two sites at Osbaldwick (Leyes & Lane), but my understanding is
that it is one Inventry system and that the Leyes site is a slave of the
Lane system.  Hob Moor Primary and Oaks have the same reception so there is
only one system there.



I can't see the link for the training webinar on your e-mail.  Can you send
this through.

Blossoms class in Hob Moor Oaks.  Johnny has been out to look at the
current one and he doesn't think it can be fixed.  It's not currently wall
mounted but they would prefer a wall mounted one.

Thanks

"","","Teacher Gmail Query - H Bruce","Good afternoon,

We set up an account for Helen Bruce a few months ago as she was covering our Early Years class for several weeks and doing supply across school regularly and will continue to do so.

With this in mind, would it be possible to keep Helen's Gmail account but remove her from the all.staff and all.teachers distribution groups because there is no need for her to receive regular updates as she is not a staff member but it is useful for her to have the account to receive planning etc for specific supply days.

Please let me know if this would be possible?

"","","URGENT Printing","We continue to have printing issues. This has been ongoing now for almost 2
weeks with either no printing available at all for some or all staff
(variable) or printing that is not effective (i.e 45 mins to print 2
documents today it can take a minimum of 5 minutes to print a single black
and white page).

We have limited access to printers as it is; it's an incredibly busy time
for us and the impact on workload is now substantial. Not to mention the
bottle-neck it is creating with jobs that can't be done. Confidential
documents, such as employment contracts, require a member of staff to wait
for the printing for up to 45 mins.

It's been logged a number of times through email and by phone over the last
two weeks. We've been told there will be an update by 12 today but
'update', not resolved.

We have a further issue with A2C which for some reason was removed from our
systems/computers. It has been on and in use throughout the exam season as
this is how we make entries so this has happened since then.

I know Nik Forrest has worked with Vital and the exam board to have this
reinstalled and we are now at the point of requesting further access keys
from the exam board. Is it possible to find out why/how this removal
occurred in the first place in order for preventative steps to be put in
place so it doesn't happen again. This system is needed to bring in exam
results over the Summer. Our admin team aren't all year round and only come
in for the exam results and therefore if it is removed again we won't be
aware until that day. The impact of this happening will be huge.

Thanks

I have delegated rights to the ""admin@stp.smccat.org.uk"" email address
which is the main address for parents/carers and outside agencies to
contact the school.

Today however, it has become apparent that when I send an email to a parent
from ""admin"" it is showing up in their inbox as coming from
aeastwood@stp.smccat.org.uk - please can you sort this?  I don't want
parents to be able to reply to my personal school email - all
correspondence should go through the admin email.  If it means removing my
delegated rights and me having to login separately to the admin account
then I will do this.

Please let me know this this doesn't make sense.

From: The IMI <updates@imiemail.org.uk>
Date: Tue, 27 Jun 2023 at 16:37
Subject: We've moving email domains, ensure you're kept in the loop!
To: <n.garton@asa.hslt.academy>


*Home <https://imiemail.org.uk/58VH-Q8A5-46X9R8-KL693-1/c.aspx>  Contact Us
<Hello@theimi.org.uk>*

Dear Nicola,


The IMI are making the move onto a new email domain as part of our Digital
Transformation project to deliver you a more personalised and dynamic
digital experience.


To ensure you're kept in the loop and don't miss out on any updates there
are some simple actions you need to take today.

*Whitelist via Gmail* <#m_-7005588646686962423_GMAIL>

*Whitelist via Outlook* <#m_-7005588646686962423_OUTLOOK>

*Whitelist via Yahoo* <#m_-7005588646686962423_YAHOO>

*How to Whitelist an Email in Gmail:*

If you’re using Gmail as your email provider, it’s easy to set things up so
that the IMI are whitelisted for all future communications. The Gmail
whitelist process can be done quickly via their web client:



   1. Click the settings button (*in the top-right corner of the screen*),
   then select Settings from the  drop-down menu.
   2. Navigate to the tab labelled Filtered and Blocked Addresses.
   3. Select Create a new filter and enter the email: *hello@imiupdates.org.uk
   <hello@imiupdates.org.uk> *or add the domain *imiupdates.org.uk
   <http://imiupdates.org.uk>*
   4. Click Create filter to approve the new filter, then mark Never send
   to Spam to whitelist this email.


*You can also Whitelist via the Gmail app:*



   1. Open the Gmail app on your mobile or tablet device.
   2. Go to the Spam/Junk folder.
   3. Click on the latest email received from *hello@imiupdates.org.uk
   <hello@imiupdates.org.uk>*.
   4. Select the option Report not spam.

*How to Whitelist an Email in Outlook:*

Whitelisting a domain or specific email address in Outlook.com is just as
easy and works by adding the address or domain in question to a group
called Safe senders. An address that has been added to safe senders will be
pushed to your inbox regardless of your spam filters. To add an address or
domain to safe senders:



   1. Click on Settings, then View all Outlook settings.
   2. Go to Junk email, then choose Safe senders and domains or Safe
   mailing lists.
   3. Enter the email address: *hello@mepemail.imiupdates.org.uk
   <hello@mepemail.imiupdates.org.uk> *or enter the domain *imiupdates.org.uk
   <http://imiupdates.org.uk>* to Safe senders.


Alternatively, you can add an the email address *hello@imiupdates.org.uk
<hello@imiupdates.org.uk>* to your Outlook Contacts.


*Whitelisting in Outlook mobile app*

   1. Open Outlook Mobile App.
   2. Click on the latest email from *hello@imiupdates.org.uk
   <hello@imiupdates.org.uk>*.
   3. Click on the three dots in the top right corner.
   4. Click Move to focused inbox.
   5. When the pop up screen comes up, click Move this and all future
   messages.

*How to Whitelist an Email in Yahoo Mail*

If you want to move *hello@mepemailorg.uk <hello@mepemailorg.uk> *or the
domain *imiupdates.org.uk <http://imiupdates.org.uk> *to your whitelist
Yahoo Mail, the process is very simple.


As long as you have already received at least one message from
*hello@imiupdates.org.uk
<hello@imiupdates.org.uk>*, all you have to do is highlight that message in
the Bulk folder and mark it as Not Spam.


On the other hand, if you've not received and email from
*hello@imiupdates.org.uk
<hello@imiupdates.org.uk>* yet, you’ll need to go through the following
steps to whitelist our new email address:



   1. Go to the Settings icon, then click More Settings.
   2. Select Filters and press Add new filters.
   3. From here, you can enter the email *hello@imiupdates.org.uk
   <hello@imiupdates.org.uk> *or the domain *imiupdates.org.uk
   <http://imiupdates.org.uk>*.


*Whitelisting in Yahoo Mail mobile app*

   1. Open Yahoo Mail Mobile App.
   2. Click on the sidebar.
   3. Click on the Spam folder.
   4. Find an email from *hello@imiupdates.org.uk <hello@imiupdates.org.uk>*
   to whitelist.
   5. Then click Move and then click Inbox.

If you're email service provider is not listing above you can either *Google
Search: How to Whitelist and email sender on 'Enter Email Service Prover
Here'* or contact our MarComms team via *marcommsinbox@theimi.org.uk*
<marcommsinbox@theimi.org.uk> who will be more than happy to assist you
further.

"","","Google Classroom","Hello,

I know we don’t have you as our support team anymore but we’re having an issue that I can’t seem to get to the bottom of. Class 4 seem to only be able to log in a limited number of Chromebooks onto Google Classroom at a time. It’s usually linked to a few specific Chromebooks but occurs even with signing out these children and logging in as others. If we do a full powerwash, this usually works for a time but we soon find ourselves back with the problem.

Do you have any suggestions at all?

Mark Ward has asked me to put a ticket in for ofsted to have wifi access at
Graham.

Please can you tell me how we go about this?

The PSK network would mean I have to get their ip and make them an
exception in the firewall.

The Hotspot has an issue of not picking up staff profiles so I can't use
that.

Hi,

I can't seem to log in to Splashlearn as a teacher any more - it's saying
""invalid email"" and that access is blocked.

Is anyone else having this problem?

Helen - could you contact Vital please? I can't set assignments if I can't
log in!!

"","","Contiuing Login Issues for MS","Morning all,

We are still experiencing significant issues with Megan's logins.

This morning Megan has found the following:

1. She can log on to her desktop computer as M.Slattery, but this
still displays her as M.Jarvis

2. The above is also true for her Edulink login - once logged in she sees
her Form as M.Jarvis and therefore has to search M.Slattery manually to
take her class registers

3. None of her previous Google logins work - no previous, current or
recently provided password is allowing an access meaning Megan has no
access to:
             a.GoogleMail
             b. GoogleDrive / English teaching resources
             c. the Bulletin

4. The above has also lost Megan access to all her bookmarked websites and
quick access to logins for things like CPOMs etc.

5. No access to any printers within the school or to FollowMe

I would also like to stress that the issue has now been ongoing for over a
week, and though I know that everyone is working to find a solution and
resolve these issues, this is creating significant strain on Megan and
those staff in the English team who are having to support her with access
to drives, resources, printing on her behalf etc.

Anything that can be done to quickly resolve these issues and return
Megan's profile to the normal way of working, would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,

Adam

and says it was changed 7 days ago. When she clicks 'forgot password' it
doesn't let her and tells her to 'contact domain provider'.

This means that she is unable to access her emails, the manor bulletin and
her resources for today which will impact her ability to teach effectively.

Furthermore, M.Jarvis is now an email address which has been disabled.

"","","Online testing during transition week","Morning Craig,
Transition week is coming up fast. It runs from Monday 10th July to Friday
14th July. You are probably aware that during that week we usually complete
our online standardised testing with all students.

There will be three tutor groups, amounting to approximately between 70 and
90 students in the Sports Hall for periods 2, 3 and 4 each day.

There are some implications for you during this week:

1. we need you to be available in the Sports Hall during periods 2, 3 and 4
each of the days of the testing, to trouble shoot etc
2. we need 90 devices (Sarah tells me we have sourced these centrally from
the Trust - can you please make sure they are in the building before the
end of next week so we can check they are compatible with the online
testing website?). These devices need to be able to be plugged into the
trolleys we have onsite at the end of each day so they start the next day
fully charged. Obviously, on the final Friday before the week itself
(Friday 7th July), they need to be left in the Sports Hall in their
trolleys so they are charging over the weekend. These trolleys need to be
left in the Sports Hall over night after each day of testing.
3. on each day of testing, the devices need to be open on exam desks and
ready to go, already logged in to the school network, so that all students
have to do is to enter their own unique code, which they will have with
them on their exam tables.

If you have any questions about this, can you please come and see me this
week?

Thanks
Lee

"","","Unable to Access Work / Missing Files / Lost Files","Hi Mateusz,

I don't know what has happened this time but I seem to be able to access less than last time after you synchronized it. The reports that I had in the folder have now disappeared and there's only two in there. The folders won't open and anything on the desktop with a cross on it won't open. I even get this message below. Will this be different when I log back in at school? I really will be upset about this if I've lost even more of my work than last time. I don't understand why I have got the message below when trying to open a folder.

I hope that you will be able to come and see again on Monday first thing what has happened unless you have any suggestions before.

Thanks,
David

"","","Fwd: KCSiE 2023 IT update urgent - Filtering and Monitoring","Dear Mike

Thank you for your time today. Below is the email I sent Giles - but
basically with the new KCSiE - we are not compliant with regard to
filtering and monitoring - it may be a Trust wide issue but we are
responsible as a school.

We have to ensure that all school devices - laptops, PCs, chrome books -
that we can monitor and know who is accessing what - currently smoothwall
only tells me this on microsoft machines. We also need to be able to
monitor what staff are accessing when at home on school PC's.

Staff PC's in school - how do we monitor what they are accessing?

Also the ipads that are used by the pastoral team.

Could we as a school have a quote on how much this would cost for Vital to
deliver so we are compliant?

Thank you
Sarah

The KCSIE 2023 draft has been released today and there is a far greater
emphasis on online safety than before -

Currently the smoothwall notification only tells me who has
accessed something they should not have if they are using microsoft - not a
Chrome book - this is no longer fit for purpose. Further guidance can be
found - https://www.safeguardinginschools.co.uk/blog/filteringandmonitoring.

We need solutions so that we as  a school are compliant with the new KCSiE
guidance. I am assuming this will be the same for all of the Trust schools.

Thank you in anticipation of a reply.

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for getting back to us with those details. First of all, we are
really sorry for all the questions - this isn't something that we've ever
come across before and so have been trying to find a suitable solution to
resolve this.

The good news is - they believe they have managed to identify the issue and
are currently testing the fix for this, which will hopefully be able to be
released soon. As soon as this has been released we will be back in touch
to let you know.

Once again, we are so sorry that you have been experiencing these issues,
but hopefully the fix will resolve it all for you!

Best wishes,

Ben

Hi Charlotte,

I can see the calendar but can not add an event to it. It says 'you can't
schedule events for this calendar'.

Can you add this please?

Tuesday 27th - 9am - 11am Kate out - knee clinic appointment.

Rach will cover for me so no need for supply.

Cheers,
Kate.

Good morning Debbie,


Hope all is well.

We've tried calling you today at 8:56, to investigate the issue you have
been experiencing with the Touchscreen not loading properly, but we've not
been able to get hold of you. I tried to contact you on the following
number: 01723 582194.

I was calling to advise you the Touchscreen is loading into the BIOS -
there is not much we can do from a remote aspect.

Would you be able to turn the Touchscreen off and disconnect the main unit
from the main power (remove the plug from the wall socket) for about 3
hours - this will allow it to full turn off and one connected and turned
back on could resolve the issue.

If the above does not resolve the issue please  could you request your IT
to check the cables for the unit, potentially try another kettle lead and
and other plug socket and see if this resolves this.

Please could you call back on 0113 322 9253 (Option 3), quoting the ticket
No. 449849, when you are next available.


Kind regards
Jamie Shortland-Johnson

"","","STP chromebook wifi issue","Please could you help with this query

chromebook used by jholt@stp.smccat.org.uk
This was a spare setup by Nick Wormald for the staff member to use who is
based at st peter's school in scarborough.

The user is having to link to the wifi manually each time. Would it be
possible to change the setting where applicable so it automatically picks
up and defaults to the correct wifi at St Peters School for this user when
logging into the chromebook

Many Thanks for your help with this issue

Think I problem I had last time was with Google Photos. Will all my photos
from there migrate over, like I assume the other Google apps will, such as
Drive and Slides and Docs.

Also, I asked before about us setting up an education account for Adobe
Spark. It got passed onto the IT desk of the trust. Did you hear
anything back?

When I try to change the password it won't let me. It sends an email to the
administrator because my account is 'not set up properly'.

Once I am on the sentinel system, I can only approve one order and then
have to go back to my emails, click on the link and go through the whole
process again. It may be something to do with the fact that I have to
approve the orders at home as I cant get through them in the school day?

still active, please could I ask that delegated access be given to Alex
Johnson (a.johnson1@pop.hslt.academy) so that this inbox can be monitored
until the position of Chair is filled?

Any help would be much appreciated.

Many Thanks

# Please type your reply above this line #

Your request (#449736 <https://support.inventry.co.uk/hc/requests/449736>)
has been deemed solved. To reopen, reply to this email or follow the link

Hello Nicola,

Thank you for contacting InVentry Support.

I understand your concern and would recommend you refer to the below
knowledgebase article to know more about how to install the InVentry
Console:


   - How To Install The InVentry Console On Your PC
   <https://support.inventry.co.uk/hc/en-us/articles/360012521478-How-To-Install-The-InVentry-Console-On-Your-PC>


Also, you may refer to the below option to get the different access for the
InVentry Console:

*Option 1 (If you have an admin user on site):*
In order to create your user account for the InVentry Console please pass
the following to a user with administrator access to the InVentry system:
- Log into the InVentry Console on your PC.
- Select 'Personnel' tab at the top, then select 'Records' on the left hand
side.
- Search for the staff member you would like to give access and click on
their name.
- A window will open on the right hand side, above this you will see
options (in a grey box) click this and select 'Edit record'.
- When the window opens please ensure that they have an email address
within their record (this will be their username).
- Once this has been checked select the 'Permissions' tab on the left,
enable the top permission, input a password and set any permissions that
they will require.
- When the permissions have been set, please click 'Save'.

Once all of the above has been completed the new user will now be able to
log into the InVentry Console.

For visual aid, please see the following support portal guide:

How To Set Up Console Access Permissions For Personnel
<https://inventry.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021818693-How-To-Set-Up-Console-Access-Permissions-For-Personnel>

*Option 2 (If you do not have an admin user on site):*
In order for us to setup any account on your InVentry system we will
require written permission from either the Headteacher, Deputy Headteacher
or the Business Manager. We require this due to the InVentry Console
application giving users access to personal data. They will also need to
advise on what level of access you require.

The different levels of access are:

- Administrator. This gives you access to all sections of the InVentry
Console application including the setup and options.
- Full access. This is the same as an admin account but you do not have
access to the setup and options.
- Staff and visitor access. Can only view staff and visitor sections.
- Pupil and visitor access. Can only view pupil and visitor sections.
- Visitor access. Can only access the visitor section.

Users will only be able to view reports that are relevant to the access
they have.

If you could please ask the above person to send an email granting us
permission to setup the account and what access is required to
support@inventry.co.uk using the ticket reference 449730 as the email
subject.

Once we receive the confirmation a member of the support team will be in
contact to arrange a remote connection to your InVentry system to create
the account.

Kind regards

Manmeet Singh

I can use my own laptop at home without issue. However, whenever I connect
to the ""ebor_academy"" wifi on a work site (e.g. at The Leyes or at

somebody sends me, it says that it cannot connect as it may be unsafe.

Do you have any answers for this?

""We would like to have a Google Classroom set up for each year group,
please:
Y7
Y8
Y9
Y10
Y11
This will allow staff to post a message direct to the students - I remember
we had this in lockdown - are you able to set it up or is it external to
us?  It would need to be set up so that students couldn't reply - just to
receive information.

Can you help?

Thanks,

Emma""

Please can someone advise me on this?

Is this something we do or is it something the teachers can set up or is it
a sims thing?

Best regards,

"","","Quote for Additional Phones","Good morning

Please could someone give us an idea of how much it would cost to install a
telephone in each classroom across school?  We are having ongoing
challenges with communication, and feel that a way forward would be for
each room to have a phone in.  We have 16 classrooms, however the 4
upstairs classrooms have one phone sited just outside of one of the rooms,
so these could potentially be moved inside.

Thanks in advance

Good morning Cara



Thank you for sending the email through; several of our clients have received this exact same phishing email.  Please ensure that anyone at the school that has received it does not open any attachments/links, and deletes it immediately.



It may also be worth notifying your IT support so that they can block the email at source.

Good afternoon,

I’m getting in touch about Invoice 0336 that remains unpaid.

After several attempts to contact you with no payment, we will shortly begin legal action in order to collect the money you owe for our services. If we receive the payment immediately, then we will close the issue without legal intervention. Please get in touch if there is anything you need from our side to get this closed.

The final invoice is attached for your reference to pass to your account payable lead.

Best Regards,

"","","Printers Not Detected [NEP]","Morning,

Recently, my laptop is not detecting the school printers. I know you are
aware of the issue and can apply a fix but it still happens each morning so
there remains a problem. It is a crucial time to prepare resources for the
upcoming day.

Is there a workaround in the shirt-term, until the problem is fully
resolved?

For context, I am in the Year 5 classroom at New Earswick Primary. I switch
my laptop off and on every day. Restarting the printer has no effect.

"","","YouTube","Hi. We are finding that some children are accessing YouTube on Chromebooks,
and watching videos that are inappropriate (often due to inaccurate naming
but also being able to bypass systems in place). Is it possible to block
YouTube for user groups in school i.e. block children but not staff? I
imagine this is hard with Surf Protect allowing sites to be blocked but
presumably for our entire domain and not specific groups. We would want
staff to still have access.

Is there an alternative?

Thanks.

It’s making a clicking sound as if it’s trying to lift up, but just isn’t.

I took delivery of a new laptop a couple of weeks ago, but have noticed

Is this a fault please?

I am assuming it is because we don't have a programme or because something
is blocked but I cannot access these AR resources from Twinkl. I was able

tech and not be able to use - I have no idea why I can't access them in
school, nothing pops up, it doesn't ask me to install anything, it doesn't
come up blocked.

"","","Re: [Ticket ID: 779667] Issue with Filtering","Hello,

We have requested an increased level of filtering across our schools, due
to several incidents where staff and pupils have managed to search
inappropriate subjects (staff were completing these searches to test the
level of filtering).

Each school will let you know about individual incidents they have had, but
we would also like to have the appropriate systems in place for September
2023 to meet the KCSIE 2023 requirements. Please see the attached checklist
which will be provided to each school's DSL to quality assure the filtering
we will require in each school.

James and I were the members of staff at Woodthorpe where we could access
guns and knives and the filtering alerts did not recognise these or block
us.

Sophie - Are you able to respond with the incidents you have experienced at
Millthorpe please.

"","","Urgent - No printer connection again","Good morning

Following the several instances that the printers failed on Friday they are
still not connecting today.

Please can this be rectified immediately.

We must find a solution as we had events at school on Friday as well as
Moderation prep and had to go to a local firm to ask them to print for us!

The connection to the printers now fails several times a day every day
which is just not acceptable.

Many thanks

Morning Carrie,
Please could you ask Vital to have a look at our tapestry app on the HMO
ipads.
Is it due an update at all? Lots of staff are struggling to add
observations via the app, and it is asking for data to be reloaded, however
when you refresh this, it doesnt' load.
I have reached out to tapestry support who have advised that it is a
device/internet issue.

They have requested that our IT team check this further, however I can
email them again, once we have checked if it is not resolved, and they will
look into it further,

Thanks in advance

Hi Karen,

Thank you for your email.  It appears that your IT department might not
have acted on the firewall change request we have alerted all of our UK
cloud-hosted customers about on the 25th of May. Please contact them and
have them confirm that they have allow-listed the following IP connection
in your school firewall - 149.137.219.247 via TCP port 2731.

Kind regards,

Sharon

Subject: Connection issue

Hi Adam,

Sorry to bother.

I seem to be having a lot of issues with the connectivity on my laptop. When I'm moving around the school building with my laptop, it's losing connection, which is happening on a daily basis and the only way I seem to be able to restore it is by shutting down my laptop. This often happens during quite important safeguarding meetings.

Do you know why this is and what can be done to fix it please?

Thanks

On Monday 26th June we would like to run an ICDL Excel diagnostic and exam
in room 102 for one student.

Rikki, please can the room be booked for this? My Y13's are finished now so
the room should hopefully be free. The Y12 class only has one student and
she can work in sixth form if in.

Exams, please can Alisha have an exam and diagnostic if she doesn't already
have one?

Craig, please are you okay to be on hand if needed for IT support?

Colleen will invigilate (Tracey hope that's correct)?

Tracey - please are you OK to let Alisha/parents know about this so she
knows to come in?

Jo I will cover Barrie's P4/5 KS3 classes, so no cover will be needed
(Kirsty just copied you in so you don't use me for cover though!).

Good morning Jemma,

Further to your request regarding an IP address for the fire alarm, below is the response from our ICT company.
I have no idea what has been asked for from Gough and Kelly and so have forwarded your email which relates to the BT upgrade to both our ICT company and CYC.

Please see below the last email from the ICT company after requesting an IP address for the fire alarm system.

Hi Debbie,

I've just had a word with Marcus in case he had any dealings with this as a technician, he says the fire alarm as far as he's aware never got given an IP address of any kind, or at least he had no involvement in it which I assume he would have had.

The IP addresses they've given you are addresses they need allowing out of your internet system so the CYC would handle that request.

I'm of the opinion the fire alarm doesn't have an IP address in school. Can you ask the fire alarm firm to confirm that the fire alarm installed at Fishergate has an IP address?

We can't give it one without the device being plugged into the network. It would then get an automatic address from the system.

Thanks,
Joe

Hi Helen,

just seen this email about the pantene and poetry workshops....the only way
I can make this work is that it is the same group of students...so the
timings can be up to you.  If they end up being shorter then the last hour
of the day could be to come along to the Burberry session again and watch
the cat walk or along to our other activity - rocket cars and watch them in
action.

I'm really hoping this is ok as I am out of time and have 3 other
activities within the space of 6 days around this one. I'll keep my fingers
crossed.

Also could you give me a heads up on resources.

I have booked Adisa the LRC again...the whole space so he can move around
and split the students up as he wants to it has computers and I can
organise anything else you may need.

Burberry - in the gym - all IT resources you normally have are booked and
the students will be groups of 5....do you want recycled materials
still...how do you want fabric pieces organising as we have some burberry
fabric left...scissors / glue sticks / glue guns / (some fabric scissors?)
/ A3 paper.????

Please be aware I have a very limited photocopying budget.

Thanks

Emma

Hi Emma,



Just a quick thought about the poetry workshops…



For Pantene and wellbeing, could you let me know the start and end times
for each workshop. They are around 2 hours/half a day each.  It’s not as
simple as doing one before lunch and one after as the afternoon session is
much shorter! So let me know what works.

Hi Emma,



That’s great, thank you.



Adisa is running the Pantene and the wellbeing workshops, so it will be
Pantene in the am for around 30 students, and wellbeing in the afternoon.



There has been a slight change with the wellbeing workshop due to changes
with that programme – Adisa is now going to do something poetry based,
meaning we can offer that to up to 30 students. Are you happy with that?
Any age group is fine.



For Burberry, our struggle is the funding as we are limited this year due
to it not being externally funded. So things like fabric, scissors, glue,
magazines etc we would need more for more students. Is the school able to
contribute any of this at all if we were to have 75 students?



I will send a guest list nearer the time as I am waiting to find out what
volunteers we have from Teeside.



Thanks

Just a few questions.

1. Burberry - If I allocated a textiles teacher to the group would you be
prepared to take more students...75?

2. Pantene - who is the person running this?  Are you doing this one
twice?  A morning group and an afternoon group...30 each time as we

We had the switch replaced on our server yesterday evening and one of our

regarding resolving this issue? The classroom teacher has a virtual

"","","Fire alarm IP address","Good morning Jemma,

Further to your request regarding an IP address for the fire alarm, below
is the response from our ICT company.
I have no idea what has been asked for from Gough and Kelly and so have
forwarded your email which relates to the BT upgrade to both our ICT
company and CYC.

Please see below the last email from the ICT company after requesting an IP
address for the fire alarm system.
Could you please reply to all so that everyone has an idea what is being
requested and maybe if we are all in the loop we can sort the request out.

Thank you

Hi Debbie,

I've just had a word with Marcus in case he had any dealings with this as a
technician, he says the fire alarm as far as he's aware never got given an
IP address of any kind, or at least he had no involvement in it which I
assume he would have had.

The IP addresses they've given you are addresses they need allowing out of
your internet system so the CYC would handle that request.

I'm of the opinion the fire alarm doesn't have an IP address in school. Can
you ask the fire alarm firm to confirm that the fire alarm installed at
Fishergate has an IP address?

We can't give it one without the device being plugged into the network. It
would then get an automatic address from the system.

Thanks,
Joe

Hi Russ,



Please see attached picture. If I plug this straight into the school
network (data point in boiler house) will I be able to bypass the modem and
connect to it remotely?




Dave


Once you have plugged it in you would need to contact the helpdesk so they
can reserve the I.P address of the device (It would no longer be a 192
address). If the device has been statically assigned the 192 address you
may need to get the management company to change this to DHCP.



If you need to connect to the device directly I’m not sure if that would
work externally due to the port forwarding from the external I.P address.

If it connects via an external 1/3rd party site you should be able to do
this. (Some devices connect to a remote server and you can control the
setting from the remote server).



Thanks



Russ

Hi Linda,

Thanks for your time today , as discussed we need to install the KPAX
automatic toner ordering system onto your schools server, could you please
forward this  email onto your IT department and if they could click here
<https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/DMCPrintAuditManagement@dmcplc.co.uk/bookings/>
to arrange a convenient time to assist me to remotely complete the install.

Below I’ve added some extra information outlining the benefits and
requirements for KPAX should you require more information.

In our continued effort to help you achieve the maximum performance and
benefits from your print devices, we would like to install our KPAX print
fleet management software free of charge to provide you with additional
benefits, including:


   - *Toner Alerts - *When the toner low threshold is reached, an alert is
   generated to us which automates your toner delivery before the device runs
   out, keeping your print devices fully operational.



   - *Meter Readings - *Automate your meter reading submission which will
   ensure accurate billing, eliminating estimated bills and avoiding any
   overcharging.


Many Thanks

Steve

"","","Re: Scam?","So the kids in my form said it's an app called W App (by a company called
Slay) where you have polls and different students are the answers and you
vote for them. The polls are pre-made, things like 'who would be the best
DJ', etc. I asked if it ever gets nasty and they said no but I think it has
the potential to cause problems with students being left out, not getting
voted for, etc. The 'compliment' on the text is apparently not a compliment
but just an invitation to join the app.

Thanks,
Anna

Do you have any spare power cables for a Dell monitor? Mine keeps going on

don't think it should do!

Since they've returned 3 of the laptops will not let students login on them, think it could be something to do with its WiFi connection maybe?

When you get chance please could you come and have a look at the 3 laptops - their numbers are 13,14,15 and are on top of the trolley in W12 at the back of the room.

The laptops are needed for lessons tomorrow but obviously understand if you are too busy to look at them this eve or in the morning.

"","","Fwd: Year 11","Hi All,

In preparation for Monday's Walking Talking Mock, can I confirm the
following with you all.

1. There will be a visualiser available for the visitor to use?
2. The projector will be set up?
3. There will be enough tables and chairs for Year 10 to sit in the hall?
Even if we have to put desks together, this is fine for this style
of presentation as it is not a mock.

Many thanks in advance,
Gemma

Thanks, Gem! Let's see what we get from the SLT outcome. I think you've
demonstrated how important it is to hear either way.

Just while I'm here, are we definitely going to have the hall set up for
this WTM on Monday? Visualiser and all?

Thanks

Hi Gill,

The VNC viewer on Edward's Ipad has dropped out and won't connect.  It has
been like this all week. We were hoping that it would reset and be ok!

Would it be possible to log this with Vital if possible.

Also can you let me know if the Chromebooks were due to be replaced as part of the contract. I was led to beleive that they would be replaced every 2 years.

I wondered if there's any way you could help me. Roxie keeps forgetting to
get me parents evening appointments on the days she's at school.
Unfortunately I don't have access to my edulink app as I have a no phone

Maths may need to complete the GLs again in the future on PCs rather than
Chrome books and we need to know that the headphones will work on the PC,
as without individual sound, the students cannot complete the tests.

Thanks very much
Kelly

"","","Dringhouses Primary","Hi there,

Just wondering if you might have a response that I can provide to my
safeguarding link governor around this question (in bold) that they've put
forward:

*I know we talked about IT before - who is doing our IT just now? Have we
> thought about how much access they have to information? If children have
> opportunities to browse the web, are sites locked down enough to keep them
> safe but open enough to allow access to sites they need? Are we getting
> alerts from searches?*


I don't know how the filtering system works and/or how adaptable it is if
we needed sites to be blocked, vs. sites automatically being blocked, and
the systems governing this? Do the searches completed by children feed into
this process?

And how is the information that Vital gather (if you do!) used and managed?

Thanks, Ben

"","","BS2","Hi,
Hope all is well.
I just want to check that BS2 is still on your rader regarding new
computers over the summer.  Since 1/2 term they have been noticeably
slower, sometimes taking at least 10 mins to log on (that's not from
powering up but when a new user logs in).  There are an increasing number
which do not log in at all, which I have been able to deal with thanks to
chromebooks (when they are available). Not too much of an issue this term
as I no longer have year 13, but I can foresee further problems in
September when I am back to a full timetable and have larger groups if
nothing is done.

At Scarcroft Primary School, we wish to encourage staff to have a healthy
work-life balance, and therefore we discourage the sending of emails
outside of the traditional working day. Where emails are received after

"","","Nursery laptop in St George's York","Hello Vital,

The nursery class teacher laptop is failing to boot - reports HDD not
installed, see pic attached. Asset tag DDWR7F2. It is in the stock cupboard
(opposite office - ask office for the key!) to keep it somewhere safe. Can
someone take a look please?

As an alternative, Dee took one out of the trolley for them to use but it
looks like it isn't set up to work on their network here. It wasn't
connected to WiFi but a reboot sorted that, however it is wanting to
connect to the (old) Stgeorges domain as far as I can tell. It's also got
the screen output rotated sideways, but a Ctrl+Alt+up arrow would sort that
out if we could get it logging on! Quick pic of logon screen which has
device name also attached.

Happy for either to be deployed in there, whatever is the easiest to get
working... But the teacher in nursery is a bit scuppered at the moment
without anything that works since the HDD issue started yesterday!

Thanks
Kat

I have an ongoing issue which started last week which means my laptop can
not be used at home or in any school apart from the bungalow at VOYA.

Repeated attempts have been made to resolve the WIFI issue but as yet are
unresolved. This is having a major impact.

When used anywhere else, including in VOYA SLT room, the lap top states it
does not have a WIFI connection, it will not allow me to access WIFI2 and
the button to turn on WIFI is grey rather than blue so can not be turned on.

I really would appreciate if this can be resolved ASAP.

Hi Ali,



Please find attached the Year 10 taster booklet for your students to
choose *three
options. *



We feel the best way to capture their choices is by a forms link, I have
created one for you here. https://forms.office.com/e/3s0eF60Thn



I have added you as a collaborator so you will be able to see the options
and who has registered by clicking this link.
https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPageV2.aspx?subpage=design&FormId=Yf_gubfs5U6U1tlHjdvKoP2nEWctBPpGmGCE_zf_glZUN0JXT0tRU0ZLNFkwNjlEWEw2MkMzSzM4MC4u&Token=3b19cf8afca84f4f97c09aa171f1d916



The sessions will look as follows:



*Session  1 10.00-10.45am*

*Break 10.45 - 11.00am*

*Session 1 cont 11.00 - 11.45pm*

*Lunch 11.45am - 12.30pm*

*Session  2 12.30--2.00pm*

*Presentation /comp winner 2.2.15pm*

*Buses depart 2.30pm*



We would suggest arrival to be between 9.30-9.45 so we can do a quick
welcome in the atrium and then get students into sessions for a 10am start.



If you can please confirm approximate numbers and that you are happy with
the attached, I will get the risk assessment created and sent over to you
for approval.



Kind regards

We have been having problems with our PC in 5H for a few months. The PC
crashes and will not respond unless rebooted. Mataus has been and looked at
a few times and has said that if it keeps happening then it may need to be
replaced. This is having a huge effect on the teaching and I would be
grateful if this could be looked at again.

"","","Managed Apple IPADS","Vital Support

We have a number of managed Ipads at St Augustine's School.
The Year 10 students are currently doing video talks for their coursework.
The Teachers have tried copying the apple videos to the Teachers pc and
have had issues

I have tried on my PC and have the same issue, So the device connects and
starts to copy Videos from the apple device to the windows pc. However they
can error when copying with ""the device is unreachable"".

Normally a power off of the Ipad and back on again resolves the issue for
me to copy across more videos

STAUGipad-01 = os 16.5 has this issue
STAUGipad-02 = 14.6 18F72 I have now updated this to the latest os version
16.5

Is there a setting that needs to be changed from the management console? Is
there any other way we can access the videos to copy off the devices
without using the cable?

I have tried various PC's and cables and have the same issues. Any Ideas?

network/firewall and then try to access the portal again. Please also
ensure that do-not-reply@pearson.com is on your allowed senders email list

We have a new teacher who will be starting with us in September to replace
someone who is leaving.

We are being asked by some portals to provide email addresses for the 23/24
year and will need to add Rebecca onto this.

Are you able to set up an email address for her and add her to the Teacher
group so that when she starts in September she will already have a live
email that she will be able to check for messages received during the
Summer from the portal.

Her name is Rebecca Kenyon

Many thanks

Hi Michael, Tim and Michelle,

I hope you’re all well?

I understand that Neil has now completed sessions with your safeguarding leads on the Incident Management Platform.
For the new Incident Management Platform to work correctly each school needs to have their own Netsweeper reference number. Unfortunately, this is not the case for Pathfinder, Ebor, and Southbank, you have one reference number per trust, not per school.

It would be helpful if we could have a call with your IT Support to discuss if there was a reason for this and how we move forward to allow all features to work correctly. Please could you advise who would be best for us to discuss and resolve this with please?

Thanks,

Subject: Re: Seneca MIS integration
To: K Brown <k.brown@voy.hslt.academy>


Kirsten,

What he needs to make sure is that every student and teacher has a school
email address on the system. I attach a guide about bulk uploading email
addresses. Normally, IT can provide you with a list of emails in a .csv
file if all students and teacher have them and then it just needs uploading.

Help is also available online:https://simsbulkimport.uk/ or if still
struggling can contact SIMS directly or I can get wonde to contact your
data manager to assist.

Best wishes
Ruth

"","","RE: Student emails","Hi all,

Ideally student email address should be in SIMS so extractors such as Wonde can use them to share to third parties. Often address are never entered due to it being a manual data entry job. We are looking to work with a new sync tool provider over summer which will writeback all the student email address into SIMS.

Kirsten, I can provide a manual list of student names and email address which you can use in the meantime. Which year groups are you looking to set up – and is this for Seneca?

Thank you

Giles

Hi,

Please can we resolve the attached issue from Kirsten. Wonde are requesting that we add emails to sims but when I have looked at sims with Jo there is no facility to add emails for students. We communicate through Edulink and this programme is picking up the students' email addresses from somewhere but I do not know where. Please can you find a solution and communicate back to Kirsten Brown.

Many thanks

the reason why it needs to be authorised for the whole of ebor, as opposed

"","","chromebooks","Hi,

It is becoming increasingly frustrating that there is seemingly no
ownership of the chromebooks.
I am willing to 'look after' and take responsibility for trolley 1, as it
happens to live in my teaching room, but often it is not returned, or if it
is then the chromebooks have not been plugged in, or are incorrectly
plugged in for charging. This then has a knock-on effect for bookings the
following day.
And it cannot be my responsibility to hunt it down at the end of each day
in order to ensure it is all plugged in and charging for the following day.

The other issue is that the chromebooks within the trolleys have all been
mixed up, and there are not enough for a whole class, so staff are often
requesting to borrow additional chromebooks in order to satisfy the demand

Good day,

Hope you are well.

Please could we ask that the Mikrotik router and NTU are rebooted again, we
can see that the Mikrotik still has an uptime 470 days.

Once the reboots have been performed, please could you run a hardwired
speed test.

Kind regards,

Hi Jao and Paula,



I'm not sure if it is you that I should be asking, but do either of you have an editable digital master copy of the B and C booklet that was shared with staff at the start of the year. I would like to adapt to make a draft for next year!

"","","ITT Login","Hi all,

I am currently an ITT here at AHS on my last day of placement. I will be
returning as an employee at AHS on June 19th 2023.

I am assuming that after today my ITT login will be terminated along with
the other ITTs. I am just emailing to check that when I return on the 19th,
I will be able to access systems and classcharts. I do not have an
induction day booked as I start immediately after my course finishes, I
presume this is usually when new starters get set up with IT logins.

Is it possible to either keep my ITT login until a new one is arranged, or
have a new one set up before June 19th?

Let me know what is best.

Thanks,
Maddie

Good afternoon
I am not sure if this is something you can help with.  I am using a different laptop and it does not seem to have the smart board programme on so I cannot use my whiteboard.  Is this something you can sort for me.  On the other laptop used by my colleague she has smart notebook 11
Many Thanks

I've just returned from maternity leave and I'm struggling to log into my
laptop. I can access my Google account without a problem, it's just the
initial screen that I can't get into (I've been using a supply account).
This is odd, as the credentials are the same for both. I thought it was
just me until I heard another colleague had a similar problem on returning
to work.

Is there something I've done wrong?

Thanks,

Louise

Hi Carrie,

Please can you look into ordering a laptop for Shona Morgan. I'm not sure
what the vital rules are with this but a laptop for her work is essential
due to the number of virtual training sessions she runs.

Preferably it would need to be linked to the server.

Many thanks, Olivia

A couple of the tasks require a valid SIMS ID account. You can use the following setup account to complete these tasks.  The username for this account is:

Dear Sophie,

Thanks for the update.

There are a few things that need to be followed by school IT support to
resolve this case.
Make sure to make the device IPs static to provide any specific filtering
to that device.
Remove any wagent installed in those devices so that they do not interfere
with the filtering process.
Once the above steps are completed share the IP address and we will add it
to the respective filter group.
We can not make the IPs static as we do not handle the DHCP server for the
school.

Please call us if you have any queries.

Kind regards,

Eshwesh

Before half term I contacted someone at Vital as my laptop which was
purchased recently as refurbished by Brion Parrot is not working. Since I
got the laptop the left side USB ports haven't been working, some of the
keys don't work; the backspace is the one that doesn't work the most and
the sound sometimes works but other times it doesn't. The person I spoke to
said he would try and get me a new laptop set up that day however, did say
it may take longer. This was Friday 26 May. Please could someone get in
touch with school regarding this.

Hi Oliver,

I know I emailed about this before half term and am aware you contacted
vital about it however our classroom chromebooks and computers bar 1 are
still not linking to the printers which is increasingly frustrating. I have
noticed that the printers available to choose have increased however they
are saying the server is not available and are also not the follow me
printer that we have been told to use.

Is there anyway this can be rectified?

Thank you

Hi Vanessa, can you confirm the DEx package version on your SIMS server
please?  To find this you need to launch the SIMS Services Manager icon on
the SIMS server desktop, then:



On the Home tab look for the Data Exchange Service and let me know the
version that displays next to it

On the About tab report the version shown there

I can't get any students through Pupil profile, or access as myself instead

Dear Vanessa,



Thank you for contacting us regarding SIMS Next Gen.



There are checks and steps needed to enable your school to be Fit for Next
Gen which are fully detailed in the following Getting Ready guide (the main
highlights are summarized below along with who is most likely to be
completing them):



*Getting ready for SIMS Next Gen*
<https://customer.support-ess.com/csm?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=5960d82e1bbce510455842a7b04bcb22&spa=1>



A couple of the tasks require a valid SIMS ID account. You can use the
following setup account to complete these tasks.  The username for this
account is:



Initial.Admin452@identityfor.simsid.placeholder.co.uk



I will send the password in a separate email.  The Getting Ready guide
above will explain how to log on to SIMS ID to complete the required tasks.
Checklist – Technician



*Software checks & Install*

   - Latest version of SIMS .net
   - Install the latest SIMS Data Exchange Patch (available in SOLUS)
   - SIMS Services Manager is active and configured correctly

·        Is Installed & up to date (version 1.4.7.1)

·        SIMS Usage Package is installed and switched on

·        SIMS Data Exchange Service Package is installed



*Finishing Touches*:

I have enabled the DeX (Data Exchange) Services Tile and installed the Next
Gen Home Tile to enable you to complete your finishing touches.



   - Input Client ID and Secret into SIMS Data Exchange Service Package
   - Switch on
   - Wait overnight for Sync


Data Preparation – School Administrator – *Step 7 in Getting Ready for SIMS
Next Gen link*



There are some recommended housekeeping tasks to be actioned by your school
to ensure all staff can access Next Gen functionality



   - Work email address set to ""Work"" and ""Main"" in their Personnel record
   - Allocate teachers and teaching assistants to classes in the pastoral
   structure. (optional)
   - Assign the correct roles/permissions in SIM7 System Manager to staff

Is there any way of getting Scratch Jr on the Chromebooks? We have the app
on the ipads, but we only have a few of those, so it would be great if it
could go on the Chromebooks. I can see online that it is available as an
app  https://www.scratchjr.org/about/faq
but not sure if our Chromebooks will run it.

The older children use the Scratch web based programme on their
Chromebooks, but it's a bit too advanced for the younger ones.

Morning Please could this email be forwarded to Vital. Thank you.

Good morning.

I am having trouble logging on to my PC at Manor Satellite, however a
chromebook is fine.

A message comes up saying:

*We can't sign you in with the credential because your domain isnt
available. Make sure your device is connected to your organization's
network and try again. If you previously signed in on the device with
another credential, you can sign in with that credential. *

I am aware this happened with another colleague here at Manor satellite too
and ended up being fixed remotely.

Many thanks for your time.

Hayley

as it is for the next 7 weeks its in the interests of both classes. I tried

"","","New Y8 starter - Millie Thompson","Hi,

I met with our new starter today and she has hopefully handed in the new
starter pack via reception this afternoon.

- Please can she be in 8RGI (has studied Spanish, good friends with Emily
Graville in this form already who we will assign as buddy)
- Mike - if there is any scope to be in Emily's classes great. She is
shy/anxious.
- IT - please can she have classcharts/google classroom once paperwork is
processed.
- Finance - please can mum have a call re: parent pay etc once paperwork is
processed. She will also need adding onto Flamingo Land list.

I will email out TT to teachers once set up. She is looking to start next
Tuesday.

Thanks,
Jessa

*Meeting minutes below Y8 team; will add to cpoms when she is on the
system: *

Meeting with mum, Millie, cm.
- Did well academically in Y7 but has struggled at Woldgate in Y8
- Has 2 sisters, Kasey Thompson in Y10 and younger sibling at a different
school.
- Already good friends with Emily Graville & Laila(?), would prefer to be
in Emily's form
- Studies Spanish but has found this hard this year
- Some low-level bullying at Woldate - boys hitting her - but main barrier
is no lasting friendships and lack of pastoral support.
- Support so far has been being able to go to Woldgate's wellbeing room at
social times as she was spending breaks/lunches in toilets as she had no
friends, but often not staffed or she was turned away
- Has accessed Wellbeing worker at Woldgate
- Woldgate offered a phased return this week after half term to alleviate
struggles. Mum said attendance really good (99%) prior to this.
- Likes Football & Gymnastics and attends clubs for these outside school.
Favourite subjects Art/Technology. Dislikes and struggles with English.
- Millie presented as being polite/smiley in the meeting and enthusiastic
about joining the school. Millie was quiet/shy and often hid behind her
hair on the tour if we passed other students. Didn't like to be stood
within view when looking at classrooms. Quite intimidated by school size
and said she is afraid of getting lost. Buddy will be Emily and safe space
Y8 office.

"","","Birstwith CE Primary School","Good Afternoon

My colleague Jamie put in a ticket yesterday about the Chromebooks not printing, Jonny has been into school this afternoon to have a look at the Chromebooks in order to get them to print.

Unfortunately Jonny was unable to solve the issue as our copier uses access codes when printing.  Jonny gave me two options, remove the access codes and print or leave on the codes and do not print.

I have spoken with the Headteacher and she would like for the access codes to be removed and then we can print from the Chromebooks.

Please can you therefore arrange for someone - Jonny possibly to return to school and see if this can be resolved?

Many thanks for your support and I look forward to hearing from you.

"","","Hue webcam in St G's Y2 (and presumably other classes?)","Hello Vital,

St G's have bought some Hue HD webcams to use as visualisers on the iwb PCs
- in Y2 it isn't apparently being detected - camera app doesn't see an
attached camera.

We can't access the device manager to investigate

Sarah tried downloading the Hue software from their website but it wouldn't
let her - required admin access.

Device name SGY-Y2

Can someone help please?

Thanks
Kat

"","","Poppleton Ousebank: Desktop tower issues","Good morning,

I would like to raise a fault regarding my classroom desktop tower. It is
consistently causing the computer to freeze.

An action such as closing a tab or attempting to send an item to print will
cause the computer to freeze, this is then followed up by the screen
suddenly reverting to lots of different coloured blue lines, sometimes
moving. It will then go back to the screen I was working on and allow me to
continue the task. We have tried to change the monitor, however the problem
still persists. It is causing issues with teaching as I am
occasionally having to reboot the machine after 5 minutes when it is
showing no signs of unfreezing or the computer itself will reboot
mid-lesson without any prior warning.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,
Rebecca Walker

I'm struggling to print from my laptop today, when I do so it crashes for a
long time which is causing delays in my workload!
Please could this be looked at?

Also, a number of my USB ports on my device do not work correctly.
Previously, they would eject my (encrypted) pendrive and I would have to
keep putting the password in multiple times. Now some of the ports do not
respond to my pendrive at all, so I cannot use my pendrive currently which
is making work hard as there are documents on there that I need to access.

Any support with these matters would be greatly appreciated!

I have two issues that I hope you can help me with:

1. Word often freezes and says' Word not responding'. I've noticed this
happens more frequently when I'm working from home. It also happens more
frequently when I'm trying to create a new document or change the layout on
a new document - especially the margins.

2. Sometimes at school I lose connection to the printer. I have to shut my
laptop down and restart it next to the printer. At the moment it won't
connect to the printer at all - no matter what I do. This has become an
urgent problem for me as I can't print.

"","","New Ticket - 05/06/2023 15:07","Hi.
I work in reception and I am having terrible problems with my computer
freezing. It is becoming unmanageable. It happens constantly, even when my
white board is not in use and there is only one window open. Today I tried
to open my register and everytime i tried to click something the computer
would become unresponsive. The mouse still moves but will not allow me to
click anything. This lasts for a few seconds and then the screen will get
white and blue lines all over it before coming back on. I then click
something else and it immediately happens again. Occasionally the screen
will go black after the blue and white lines and not come back on resulting
in me having to turn it off.
The computer froze 5 times, just whilst trying to complete the register
alone.
Kind regards
Becky Evans

"","","Poppleton Ousebank","Hi,

I’m a year 2 teacher at Poppleton Ousebank Primary School. I’ve been having
computing issues:
My smart board and computer keep freezing.
My mirroring isn’t working. So whatever my computer is showing, isn’t
showing up on my smart board and when it does it just freezes. The Problem
don’t resolve even after switching my computer off.

Thank you for your help,

Roxy

Hi,

I'm sending this to confirm what the issue is currently so you can go to Vital about it.

The server our database is on that also runs the wallscanner is BSCHJSSRV01. This was likely setup by your older IT provider but seems to have been left running for our system. Vital have said they have no access to this and no credentials. Without these details we cannot support the system and will be locked out of your data in the event that you ever want to save it. We would highly recommend migrating our database to a server controlled by Vital so we can provide support in the future.

The system will work as it is currently for the screen and VisitED but we are unable to restore the wall scanners. We can do the server migration for our database but to do this we will need remote access to both servers and it will be a cost of £150 + VAT. If we cannot get access to this old server we can also setup a new database on a different server or the touchscreen and point everything to that instead. We can take a backup of the old server and import that to the new one as long as that is on so you shouldn't lose any data.

Lastly, we do have a new cloud based system which is an upgrade to the system you are currently using so you could also look in to moving over to that, especially since we are eventually going to end support for the legacy system you are using currently. Please see this link for information about that. 5D Software Suite| Visitor Sign In | Asset Inventory | Incident/Accident Reporting — SG World<https://www.sgworld.com/pages/5d>

"","","Microsoft Authenticator App Log in Issues","From Supply Teacher <supply.pat@ebor.academy>: Hi,

I am a teacher at Patrington Primary.

I have just recently got a new phone and I am now unable to access my own
email account via the Microsoft Authenticator App. Everytime I try to log
in, the Microsoft website tries to send me the access code to my app but
the app does not work. The app would like me to scan the QR code or to
enter a code manually but these do not appear on the computer screen. When
I press the ""Begin Recovery"" button on the app, it said that there was no
backup stored in the iCloud account.

Are you able to help me with this please?

My work email address is: s.nippress@ebor.academy but I can not access
this. Please could you get in touch with Jane Wilson:
j.wilson2@ebor.academy.

Many thanks,

"","","New Starter in the Central Team","Good morning Joe

I hope you're well.

We have a new starter in the Central Team joining us on Monday 19 June, and
I'd be grateful if you could set up their account and email and send me her
login details once she's all set up.

The new starter is Louise Clark
Her email should be l.clark@southbanktrust.co.uk

Louise is joining us as a Finance Assistant. We already have a keyboard,
mouse, screen and phone for her - so do not need any more hardware as far
as I'm aware.

Mike will be in touch about systems and folders she will need access to, so
that this can also be arranged.

Let me know if you have any queries.

Many thanks

Your Google Analytics account needs immediate attention. Our next-generation measurement solution, Google Analytics 4, is replacing Universal Analytics. Starting July 1, 2023, standard Universal Analytics properties will stop processing new data. If you use Google Ads, this means that any Universal Analytics data that you're using for ad campaigns will start to degrade and your ad performance may be impacted. We strongly recommend that you follow our step-by-step guide to make the switch to Google Analytics 4 as soon as possible<https://notifications.google.com/g/p/ACUgQrFzH0hQaZuD3Tjb0y0qKgbAS65236NON1vxNeh8SFJTGhMKUmq-CIOt-dvtqKjykhgLY8LILRLomQ-eVTDvkP_NpvYaIfESPmw693gH-TlaTrmpmwXl7ms3ALDsFlCYrAeU7NlXmUBwDpVarnBM-TCJRGB7AU_ZPt1ZVjd0ychMj71L-urmWgcDlz3qabfCXVVxFHbSjlcoZV--E3M7U-7Iz5H6_1NgOS4IToKEsW6BHQmCCEWw3cIMqbarOukSp17Swn8VA63iMqseEXM4VHA0E4Wvtq075qGYun4TAQIrai1CTDlLjboFT6jRCDvQcFDMqbVob_kFfNCs248dMv0G9WmXfH5eCiHXrJOXlYjITk9yIe4al6cRh_zVpm7ImnTlxg>.

To build data and continuity in Google Analytics 4, it is essential that you start your setup now. This will allow you to start collecting the right data in Google Analytics 4 for your unique needs, and help avoid disruption to any Google Ads campaigns still relying on Universal Analytics conversions and audiences.

Unless you've opted out, we've already configured or soon will configure a Google Analytics 4 property for you with some basic features, including certain goals and Google Ads links moved over from your Universal Analytics configuration. But parts of your existing Universal Analytics setup, including custom dimensions and metrics, cannot be moved. Customizing your Google Analytics 4 setup now will ensure you collect the right data for the specific conversions, audiences, and other Analytics data that you care most about, so you can continue to measure your most valuable actions and run more efficient ad campaigns.

"","","re: email address/content query","Hi there

I hope you are all well.

I am moving to New Earswick Primary school in September to be their new
Head.  I'm excited but obviously sad to be leaving my Knavesmire family
after 17 years!

I have a query regarding my email address/content please.

I have a *LOT *of email folders with key contacts and information inside
that I really don't want to lose when I move schools.  Is there a way I can
somehow portal them across to my new email address?  Or some way of copying
all their content somewhere?  I'm aware
my hgibson@knavesmire.southbank.academy account will cease to exist...

Many thanks in advance for your help with this.

It’s Sunday afternoon and I’ve realised that I need to set up a scheduled
email from Ebor’s Red Box account to go out at 9:30am tomorrow. I’m in a
meeting at 9:15 so can’t do it “live” and although my email account works
on my phone, it doesn’t have access to the Red Box account.

My Ebor account still doesn’t work on my laptop - it is not recognising the
password you gave me, Holly, on Friday.

I don’t expect any action today but can efforts be made asap tomorrow and
certainly before 9:15? I’m available any time after 6am.

In July we will be hosting some Y6 students for their induction week (not
sure of the exact date but usually either last week of term or the week

The Y6 students usually have a taster Computing session during this time.

Last year we used the following details to log into Windows:


   -

   Username: Year6
   -

   Password: Cat


Please can you advise if these accounts still exist, and if not, please
would it be possible to set up accounts which could be used in that week by
the students?

In addition, we used the following website last year as part of the lesson
- https://www.lightbot.lu/, I have just tested this from my Chromebook but
this appears to now be blocked - please would it be okay to unblock this
site for use during that week?

As you may be aware, a request to integrate with your MIS has been made by Seneca. Here at Wonde we are able to securely connect to your school MIS (SIMS, RM Integris, ScholarPack etc) and ensure that the data will always stay up to date within Seneca.

As you already have a Wonde connection, we have contacted your School Portal account holder to ask them to approve access to the data required by Seneca

Good evening Adam,

Elvington's Chair of Governors (j.sharma@elvingtonprimary.org.uk<mailto:j.sharma@elvingtonprimary.org.uk>) is having the difficulties as described below:

I struggle to send emails to external key stakeholders. And our Clerk does not have access to our shared drive. I’d really like to try to resolve both of these. I’d like the minutes of all meetings to be saved in the shared drive for Govs to refer to and the easiest way to do that is to allow the Clerk access. Is this something you /Angels could resolve with IT colleagues please?

Any suggestions/support would be greatly appreciated.

Good afternoon Oliver,


Thank you for your time on the phone, as discussed the Inventry Console is
getting wiped from your PC daily.

You already have a script file on your PC to install the Inventry Console
automatically, I was going to put this into the ""*shell:common startup*""
(or the *shell: startup*) folder so this would run automatically on boot,
however your active directory account did not have access to do this.

As this is getting removed automatically it could be the group policies
which is removing the map.

If you can forward this to your IT, they will be able to confirm or add the
.VBS script to the startup folder.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us on
0113 322 9253 (Option 3).


Kind Regards.
Jamie Johnson

Machine RFC9509785 in the Hope Learning Trust office at Vale of York

servicing?

All documents are coming out a greyish colour as if the toner is leaking
onto the entire page as it prints. It also seems to be using toner at an
excessive rate, i.e we replaced it two weeks ago and it needed to be
replaced again this week.

Barrie - please can you advise exams which students need diagnostics/exams
assigning and how many? Please can you also advise which time the exams
will run just so Craig/Tracey are aware when they will be needed?

Tracey and Collaine will be invigilating the exam like last time (at Arc).

Thanks everyone

Hi Lisa



Just a quick email regarding the ticket below …. I have reached out to my colleague Paul in the North regarding the solution you have.



If we can ask for your IT to grant us teamviewer access to the server please we can then look to remove the passwords for the user having issues and test all is ok and working again.



Please keep us updated.



Many thanks.

Huntington Primary Academy and Poppleton Road Primary School - both schools
will become part of Pathfinder MAT on 1 September 2023.

PMAT Emails/Logins - I would like to set up for both schools - I will

to be shared with the schools yet but just with the central team so other
systems etc. can be set up in advance pf conversion)

progress

Networking/Re-imaging of PC's/Internet - to agree dates for the works to
take place during the summer holidays for both schools

Would it be possible to provide an idea of the costs involved in the IT
conversion process. I understand that these will vary based on hardware
requirements etc. but an indication for the budget would be much
appreciated.

"","","New Site Office Workstaion","Hi all,

I have a new device which controls the CCTV and Door access system which is
working great. The only issue I have is that it goes to sleep after 10
minutes. Ordinarily this would be fine, however I lose access to the CCTV
system and wait  for the system to reload which can take up to five
minutes.

Please can this timeout be set to at least one hour.

Thank you

"","","WIFI - weak signal","Hi Vital,

The wifi is not very strong at all and keeps dropping out in the school
office as well as some areas in school.

The wifi used to have a strong signal in the office with the full 3 bars on
the wifi symbol on the ipads now this is often just one bar and drops out.
This is the same on several different ipads and in some other classrooms
too.

It has been a weak wifi signal for a few weeks now but we have been
managing it but it is becoming more of a problem now.

Thank you

We're having a few issues with our staff iPads, mainly that the storage
seems to be full of apps that we don't use, but it means staff can't take
photos/ use the iPads correctly, or they go so slowly that they are almost
useless. Is there any chance that we could remove a lot of the apps that
aren't being used in order to make them more functional? At the moment,
staff are needing to use the children's iPads rather than the staff ones.

"","","Laser cutter software? Is this correct","Hi I have tried last week and again today to try and cut out the Y11 pieces.

The laser cutter is not responding and I have looked at a lot of different
parameters, but cannot find anything. I also get strange messages on the
laser cutter.

Is this software that has been installed the correct version?

The reason that I ask is that it looks different and has a strange title at
the top.

I feel this is for another type of laser cutter, it also says it is A3 at
the top.

Can we check with someone in the office about the end date within Sims for

"","","Reimaging two laptops, and arranging disposal of others (Deramore's)","Hello Vital

Following the install at Easter, please can we organise for:

   - The laptop that was the head's to get re-imaged and deployed into the
   school hall to run the AV system there
   - The laptop that was the SBMs to get re-imaged and deployed in the
   staffroom to run the screen in there
   - The disposal of the end-of-life dell 13"" laptops (currently stacked
   in/on a storage trolley in the server room) - I think we'll keep the trolly
   though, in case down the line we manage to fundraise for devices to go in
   it!
   - There is also one HP Chromebook in the server room that has a broken
   screen and needs disposing of
   - The former admin PCs (in the server room with a note of since install)
   can probably go too
   - The head is going to make sure he has taken anything he wants off his
   old iPad and once that is done, that can be wiped and made available for
   use elsewhere in school as originally discussed


I'd suggest a Monday or a Thursday afternoon would be good or, at a pinch,
a Friday - I can be on site to make sure all goes smoothly then! Next week
would be excellent if possible.

We also have the two interactive projectors that were going to be kept as
emergency 'spares' for Y4/5/6 who don't have touchscreens however they look
to me like they may have been damaged since being removed - if someone
could make an assessment that would be helpful, and if they are no use as a
spare they will need disposing of too.

Thanks
Kat.

"","","twitter on teacher ipads","Good afternoon,
please can you have a look to see if the access settings have changed on
the ipads we have designated as teacher ipads? They no longer have access
to Twitter for some reason.
One of the ipads, allocated to Woodpeckers, has a fault meaning it can no
longer take photographs. Please can someone have a look at this when you
get chance too.
Thanks,

blocked for all students. At the moment I've got a workaround where I've
created an EAL Students OU under the Staff OU to bypass the block. However
Wonde keeps moving them back into the correct OUs so it's clear that as
well as this giving them unfiltered web access, it's not a sustainable
option going forward as I have to continuously move them back into the EAL
Students OU.

Is there a way we could create a seperate blocklist to add students too so
that they can access translation tools?

Thanks,

"","","New Ticket - 27/04/2023 09:52","Morning,

I just wanted to make you aware that the telephone in the PE office is not
working and hasn't been for a number of weeks.
This makes it very difficult for reception to get in touch with us quickly
or vice versa. It also means that when we have to contact parents we have
to find an alternative phone to use, which is not ideal.
Would it be possible for someone to come and have a look at it please?

Thanks in advance
Laura

L Cousins PC has not had a re image for 4 yrs. Dan is cautious it's missing critical updates. Exams/finance have usually been left out of re imaging cycles over the years as there software is usually a hassle to install and get right. Louise has a few pieces of software that seem to be unique, but not as many as I'd of thought;

- A2C
- SIMS NOVA T6
- School Cloud Extract Tool

Can we arrange with Dan/Steve to get a new machine, install the programs and install into Exams prior to Summer. Keep the old machine handy in case we've missed anything she desperately needs.

Dear colleague,

Please find attached your Photo Importer licence files along with instructions on how to apply. Your new licence is valid until 31st March 2024. Please keep this email safe so that your licence is available when you require it.

What do I need to do now?
Do not attempt to open the licence file other than by using the batch import process within SIMS.net. You just need to right click on the Photo Licence file attached to this email and save it somewhere to your system.

How do I order a new licence once this one expires?
Each year you will be required to log into the ESS Portal to administer your agreement with ESS, and Photo Import Licence will be included in this, once your initial term for Photo Import Licence expires. This means that your Photo Import Licence will automatically renew and each year we will issue you with an updated Photo Import Licence automatically.

What if I wish to cancel my Photo Import licence?

We require at least 90 days written notice, prior to your next renewal date (31st March) in order to cancel your Photo Import licence. This means that notice is always due, no later than the 31st December prior to your initial contract term end date (for example, if your contract term end date is 31st March 2025, then notice is required no later than 31st December 2024). Notice must be sent, in writing to SIMSContracts@parentpay.com<mailto:SIMSContracts@parentpay.com>. If sufficient notice is not received, then your Photo Importer Licence will be automatically renewed, as per the Terms outlined in the ESS Portal when this becomes available to you.

"","","Adding trainees to email groups - a change to process","Hi Kev,

The trainees spoke to me at the end of last term and made me aware that
they are not routinely added to pastoral or departmental email groups and
are missing out on really valuable information that they need to know
regarding their departments and year teams.

Please could I ask you to do two things for me?

1. As an immediate remedy please could you add the following  students to
the following pastoral and department email groups up until *19th May*
unless otherwise stated.

2. Please could we amend our protocol for new ITT trainees so that it
requires me to tell you the department and year group to which each ITT
trainee is attached and then could you please add them as a matter of
course going forward once their email address is activated.

Does that sound like a plan?

Is it possible to check if the fingerprint software is back up and running,
it's disappeared from the computer it was on since the cyber attack. It
should be on one of the machines in the admin office.

"","","Desktop computer","Hi Craig,

Now that we have the biometrics back up and running and the capability to
print lunch cards again Sarah has authorised a desktop computer to be
located in the Student Services Hub. This will enable both the card printer
and the biometric reader to be moved across to the Hub were students visit
when they have lost their lunch card.

This will streamline the process as currently the team are based in one
area at key times and the equipment in another.

If a desktop cannot be made available which is already onsite then one will
need to be ordered.  Once a desktop is located in their both of the
packages will need to be added to the machine as well.

Can I leave this with you to arrange please.

Thanks,

Simone

"","","Seneca","Hello,

I would like to link seneca with our schools MIS system. I am not sure who
to talk to about this Stacey suggested IT.

Here is a link to the details.

It would involve sharing data with a third party so I can't just set it up

Hi there,

I have a child in Year 2 (Wharfe, last year Aire) who's login does not work.
Please can this be reset or re shared with myself to ensure it is correct and he can access learning on the Chromebook.

Thank you.

"","","WiFi SSID creation for tablets","Hi,

I have been asked to submit a ticket regarding a WiFi SSID being created
for some of the tablets we have in school.

These tablets are not managed devices by Vital (Kindle Fire tablets, from
before we were part of Ebor academy trust). There are roughly 40 devices.

Currently, they are using the Ebor_Academy SSID to gain access to TT
Rockstars, Spelling Shed SeeSaw etc. (their only use case).

The problem with this is that every 60 days we are required to change the
passwords associated with the accounts we log into Ebor_Academy with, which
becomes quite a tedious process.

Is it possible for us to have an SSID created that can be used by these
devices? Like we had created for Ofsted inspectors to use during their
visit.

Thanks,

Scott Marshall
