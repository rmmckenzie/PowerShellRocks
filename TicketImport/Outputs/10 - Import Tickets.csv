Digital - Microsoft 365
Office 365 A1 Plus for education will retire on August 1 2024

Office 365 A1 Plus is being retired by Microsoft to ensure schools have
compliant licensing plans, and to support the transition to cloud licences
Microsoft 365 A3 and Microsoft 365 A5. Microsoft Office 365 A1 Plus program
is an Office subscription that includes Office desktop apps for qualified
schools that purchased Office institution-wide for faculty and staff.

Previously any school who purchased an Open Value Subscription Education
Solutions (OVS-ES) annual volume licence agreement would get the Office 365
A1 Plus licence added to their Microsoft 365 Tenancy. Find out more here.
<https://nyes.info/Newsletter/ExternalLink/208501?source=newsletter&guid=E91E4A24-D853-4015-9D19-FF3BB982251C>

If you have a Software and Infrastructure contract with NYES Digital, no
further action is required. The support team will check the licences for
you.

What happens if you don’t have the above contract?

Then…
If you’d like to check yourself, you can do this from the Microsoft 365
Admin Portal.

   1. Navigate to the M365 Admin Portal https://admin.microsoft.com
   <https://nyes.info/Newsletter/ExternalLink/208502?source=newsletter&guid=E91E4A24-D853-4015-9D19-FF3BB982251C>
-
   Login as your school's Microsoft 365 Administrator.
   2. On the left-hand navigation menu, go to Billing > Licenses.
   3. Look for Office 365 A1 Plus for Faculty and Office 365 A1 Plus for
   Student assigned licenses.

You will be currently using one of the following:

*Office 365 A1*
Free online Office productivity and learning tools. Includes online web
versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Microsoft Teams, and
additional classroom tools.
*Office 365 A1 Plus *
Offers everything that comes with Office 365 A1 and also includes the full
desktop apps for Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook) not
just the online web versions.

*After all existing Office 365 A1 Plus licences expire on August 1st, 2024,
schools will have the choice to:*

1. If the school has an active Microsoft OVS-ES volume licence agreement,
which includes the Desktop apps:

We have a supply teacher from Supported Recruitment who is staring with us

a good idea to set her up with an email and Gaynor suggested she does our

Hi Andrew



Just to let you know that the 1 user licence that came with the Smart
Boards we supplied and installed in 2019 is due to be renewed at the end of
August.



If you are using the Smart Premium Software for interactive Teaching &
Learning, then you would need to renew the licences by then.



The Smart License options are attached, most schools nowadays go for the
3-year option as it is a substantial saving over buying the software every
year.  The Licences are for number of users not number of boards, if you
would like additional users to have a licence, please let me know and I
will amend the quotation for you.



Here is a YouTube link for Lumio Demo https://youtu.be/zQQX2mbwqe4  and the
Smart Premium Notebook https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGDznVbEISs



If you wish to renew the licences the simplest way to order is to email me
back and copy and paste “Please proceed with quote 33990 or 33992 to the
value of £45.00 or £114.75”



Any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.



Kind Regards



Sarah

Yesterday (24th July) at 15.50 Leanne Muir sent Rachel Hardy an email that
was meant for me.  Is it possible for you to access it and delete it from
Rachel's inbox?  Rachel is term time only so she shouldn't be checking her
emails at the moment.

Rachel is taking over some of Leanne's work and Leanne was trying to let me
know that she was making quite a lot of mistakes and it won't be a nice
email for Rachel to read when she first returns.

Thank you.

that. This is their reply. Can you please confirm whose job it is to
unblock websites we need at school? In the past you guys say it is them and
now they're saying it's you. I was trying to get netflix allowed for
teachers to use in the final term ( I have had this at school for last 3
years until we had some work done on the system) but even cbeebies is
blocked now so there would be a few we would need doing.

Subject: Huntington School - 816/4063 - Failing connection - Sims.net update and server needs a restart



[Wonde.com]<https://wonde.com>



[Action required]

SIMS server needs restarting

Hi Claire

It looks like your SIMS connection with Wonde isn’t working as expected. This will affect the syncing and updating of any information between Huntington School and your applications (13) through Wonde.

Please be assured, even though the connection is failing, your data is protected and secure.


Next steps


Access the machine and open SIMS.net


If you get a SIMS error message when attempting to log in then the recent client update has not been successful and you will need to reboot the server.


If you are able to open SIMS.net please re-apply the latest SIMS client update to the server and reboot again.

Once the above steps are complete, please email support@wonde.com to let us know, including your school name, postcode and an identifier such as the DfE number or URN.


If you have any issues with the above or would prefer to speak directly with our support team please Click here<https://school.wonde.com/book-appointment/failing/huntington-school> to book an appointment.

If you are not the right person to resolve this, please forward to the appropriate person.

If you have any questions, please contact us. We look forward to getting this resolved as soon as possible.

Kind regards

People are telling me that there are temperamental connection issues when
trying to cast a device onto the big screen in the boardroom here at The
Leyes.

Sometimes laptops can 'see' the 'Office TV' description and sometimes they
can't.

The office here is open until Friday 26 July, is then shut for a few weeks
and reopens on Monday 19 August. Could it please be looked at?

Thanks

I've just been informed that the interactive screen in our nursery isn't

Apparently this has been reported previously by Mandy Carolan and she was

"","","Re: Important Notification: CrowdStrike Update Issue Impacting Windows Systems","Hi,

A new updated has been shared by CrowdStrike:

Summary

  *   CrowdStrike is aware of reports of crashes on Windows hosts related to the Falcon Sensor.

Details

  *   Symptoms include hosts experiencing a bugcheck\blue screen error related to the Falcon Sensor.
  *   Windows hosts which have not been impacted do not require any action as the problematic channel file has been reverted.
  *   Windows hosts which are brought online after 0527 UTC will also not be impacted
  *   This issue is not impacting Mac- or Linux-based hosts
  *   Channel file ""C-00000291*.sys"" with timestamp of 0527 UTC or later is the reverted (good) version.
  *   Channel file ""C-00000291*.sys"" with timestamp of 0409 UTC is the problematic version.

Current Action

  *   CrowdStrike Engineering has identified a content deployment related to this issue and reverted those changes.
  *   If hosts are still crashing and unable to stay online to receive the Channel File Changes, the following steps can be used to workaround this issue:

Workaround Steps for individual hosts:

  *   Reboot the host to give it an opportunity to download the reverted channel file.  If the host crashes again, then:
     *   Boot Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment
     *   Navigate to the %WINDIR%\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike directory
     *   Locate the file matching “C-00000291*.sys”, and delete it.
     *   Boot the host normally.

Note:  Bitlocker-encrypted hosts may require a recovery key.
Workaround Steps for public cloud or similar environment including virtual:
Option 1:

  *   Detach the operating system disk volume from the impacted virtual server
  *   Create a snapshot or backup of the disk volume before proceeding further as a precaution against unintended changes
  *   Attach/mount the volume to to a new virtual server
  *   Navigate to the %WINDIR%\\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike directory
  *   Locate the file matching “C-00000291*.sys”, and delete it.
  *   Detach the volume from the new virtual server
  *   Reattach the fixed volume to the impacted virtual server

Option 2:

  *   Roll back to a snapshot before 0409 UTC.

Workaround Steps for Azure via serial

  1.  Login to Azure console --> Go to Virtual Machines --> Select the VM
  2.  Upper left on console --> Click : ""Connect"" --> Click --> Connect --> Click ""More ways to Connect""  --> Click : ""Serial Console""
  3.  Step 3 : Once SAC has loaded, type in 'cmd' and press enter.
     *   type in 'cmd' command
     *   type in : ch -si 1
  4.  Press any key (space bar). Enter Administrator credentials
  5.  Type the following:
     *   bcdedit /set {current} safeboot minimal
     *   bcdedit /set {current} safeboot network
  6.  Restart VM
  7.  Optional: How to confirm the boot state? Run command:
     *   wmic COMPUTERSYSTEM GET BootupState

For additional information please see this Microsoft article<https://azure.status.microsoft/en-gb/status>.

If you can provide the IP of any of the affected schools, I can look to add them into the exclusion list which should help prevent the issue moving forward.

Hello Chris,

I hope all is well.

You are correct. Usually the sites that we've encountered before all access the site via the same IP address however it appears from where this site have multiple different schools under the same trust, each site has a different IP address based of what Elanor has mentioned.

I am able to log in via both Elanor and Tracey from my end and able to successfully access YPO so the issue appears to be relating to IP addresses. If there is anything further I can help with, please let me know.

Kind Regards,

"","","RE: Punchout Issue","From Rida El-Mailoudi <Rida.El-Mailoudi@civica.co.uk>: Hello Chris,

I hope all is well.

You are correct. Usually the sites that we’ve encountered before all access the site via the same IP address however it appears from where this site have multiple different schools under the same trust, each site has a different IP address based of what Elanor has mentioned.

I am able to log in via both Elanor and Tracey from my end and able to successfully access YPO so the issue appears to be relating to IP addresses. If there is anything further I can help with, please let me know.

Kind Regards,

CAUTION:  This email came from outside of Civica - only open links and attachments you’re expecting.


Hi,

As per Elanor’s email, I’m picking this up separately.

While it’s unusual for users at the same place to have different IPs, pretty much all Punchout systems we interact with all send their connection through the same IP (the iP from the system, in this case Civica), so if it’s working for one user, I can’t see any reason why it wouldn’t be working for all who are using it?

If you have any ideas for me try at this side, I’m happy to do so.

Good morning,

I have cc'd in our IT support helpdesk, can you please communicate with them regarding the IP addresses? I can now get on via punchout but my colleagues are unable to do so and I suspect this is due to different IP addresses that are not whitelisted.

Kind regards,

"","","Re: Important Notification: CrowdStrike Update Issue Impacting Windows Systems","Good Morning all,

As an addition to my previous email please find the below.

Workaround Steps for individual hosts:

  *   Reboot the host to give it an opportunity to download the reverted channel file.  If the host crashes again, then:
     *   Boot Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment
     *   Navigate to the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike directory
     *   Locate the file matching “C-00000291*.sys”, and delete it.
     *   Boot the host normally.

Note:  Bitlocker-encrypted hosts may require a recovery key.

Workaround Steps for public cloud or similar environment:

  *   Detach the operating system disk volume from the impacted virtual server
  *   Create a snapshot or backup of the disk volume before proceeding further as a precaution against unintended changes
  *   Attach/mount the volume to to a new virtual server
  *   Navigate to the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike directory
  *   Locate the file matching “C-00000291*.sys”, and delete it.
  *   Detach the volume from the new virtual server
  *   Reattach the fixed volume to the impacted virtual server

 Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
Many thanks

Lucy Ashcroft already has her attendance email, which parents/carers will

"","","Re: Punchout Issue","Good morning,

I have cc'd in our IT support helpdesk, can you please communicate with
them regarding the IP addresses? I can now get on via punchout but my
colleagues are unable to do so and I suspect this is due to different IP
addresses that are not whitelisted.

Kind regards,

I have a question about what happens about emails that may still initially
come to my Poppleton Road email address after I leave today and join AHS in
September

I have my new AHS email address now and at the moment I'm receiving emails
to both from both schools.  Is there a way of forwarding any Poppy Road
mail that comes to me for a while just until all my contacts stop using
it.  I will send as many as I can emails today to remind them but I figure
some will slip through.

My new email is abannister1@ahs.pmat.academy

Hello Clair,

We have been notified that the SIMS workstation application has been updated. (Huntington School - YO32 9WT)

For InVentry/SIMS to sync data correctly, we must ensure the InVentry SIMS Connector service is updated using Admin.

Your local IT support will need to perform the update on the SIMS server or on the local InVentry system. (depending on where the SIMS connector service is installed)

You can find the location within the Console Settings > Integrations menu.

[https://inventry.zendesk.com/attachments/token/XrdKNvSvg3wZIIVkUo5hGnu3y/?name=inline1131393771.png]

We have included a tool to download and run on the SIMS server to perform the update.

Please refer to the below video tutorial on how to run the updater.

SIMS Installer video on Vimeo<https://vimeo.com/956546970/b48d98ec51?share=copy>

If you run into any issues applying the update, please contact our support team on 0113 322 9253 (Option 3)

Kind regards,
Sachin.

"","","Removal of interactive whiteboard for building work","Good evening

I’ve been informed late this afternoon that we are having some building
work done during the summer holidays to knock through a wall to join 2
classrooms (Lions and Tigers) as 1. There is an interactive whiteboard on
the wall in Lions classroom which will need to be removed from the wall in
order for the wall to be knocked through.

The work is scheduled to start w/c 29th July for 3 weeks. That would mean
we need IT support to remove the whiteboard next week please. We haven’t
yet decided where we will re-site the board, so if it could please be
stored over the summer in the cook school room? It will be out of the way
there of any other work happening.

Debbie Storry is the relief caretaker opening and closing school next week,
but won’t be necessarily on site the whole time. If you are able to give me
any indication at all of a day you’re likely to come it would be
appreciated.

"","","Ipad Question","Hi Vital

Lydia has asked it possible to prevent students from logging in to Youtube
accounts on the Ipads? A student used Ipad 1534 to login to their mothers
youtube and then watch videos they normally watch at home.


Is there multiple ways to do this?


Kind regards

One.of our new staff members has been allocated a laptop, and having logged

Please could this be installed - perhaps when you are doing the system

I don't think we can restrict by purpose. We could probably set it to restrict to only use in school, or to disable certain areas of the off 365 suit such as emails. I don't think we can restrict access by location outside of school.

Hello Tracey,



Thank you for your email. That sounds like a browser re-direction being
blocked instead of it being a FinancialsLive issue as I’m able to on both
Amazon and ESPO through your account with no need to manually re-direct. I
would suggest reviewing your browser settings and ensure automatic
redirection is enabled for those sites.



Lyreco also appears to be slightly delayed on my end also so this may just
be how it is currently set up on their end. Please bare in mind whilst the
system is in it’s testing phase that there will be no emails or purchase
orders automatically sent out.



Kind Regards,

Hi Rida



The other punchout suppliers have now appeared.  I've gone onto all of them
and found that both Amazon and ESPO are not automatically redirecting.

They do open when you click on the 'click here' link.  Lyreco does open up
but with quite a delay.  The others seem to redirect to the sites straight
away.



*Kind Regards*

Good Morning,



I hope all is well!



YPO does appear to be working on my end when clicking on the link. Would
you be able to send a screenshot of the issue which contains any error
messages you may be receiving? You may need to enable automatic re-directs
on your browser for this to work correctly.



Banner and ESPO are currently with the cloud team as they are configuring
the system to be able to access their links. As soon as that is completed,
the links will appear for those. I don’t believe I’ve received any
additional information for Lyreco. Would you be able to send this across at
your earliest convenience?

Good morning Rida,



I hope you enjoyed your break.



I wanted to query the YPO punch out with you as this does not seem to be
working correctly. The link is showing but it will not connect to YPO.



The other three providers Banner, Lyreco and ESPO are also not showing at
all. Do you know if there is a reason for this or do you need anything
further from me?

For Mon 2nd Sept please can we have chairs around large tables (exam tables grouped together) in the main hall. Enough for all staff to be seated.

These can stay in place for the morning sessions on Tues 3rd. After lunch, please can the tables be put away and the chairs put into rows in readiness for the staff meeting at the end of the day/assemblies.

Please note we will also be using research school, the dining hall, MfL classrooms, G0-01, C0-14 over the 2 days, so please can these be ready for use? James, please can you ensure the ICT and projection facilities are working in these rooms?

Katie Hunter will be using the dining hall to meet subject leaders afterschool Mon 2nd. Please can this be setup with chairs around large groups of exam desks, as it was when we had the SLT/governor presentation in there earlier this term?

Many thanks in advance for your support with this, I will be in on GCSE results day if there are any questions nearer the time.

Best wishes

"","","Re: Help with Y7 IT logins","Hi all

I've now confirmed with Chris that the Year 7 IT logins can be generated in
the last few weeks of the summer holidays.

Katie R has confirmed that the office team will need to be sent the Y7 IT
login spreadsheet by the start of week 6 (26th August) in the holidays
for them to print these onto stickers and organise them into form groups.

IT support - please can you email the office team with the Year 7 IT logins
at the start of week 6? (Please include me in this email)
Office team - please can you print these onto stickers that students can
stick into their planners during the first week? These will need to be
passed onto the Year 7 form tutor team. Massive thank you in advance for
this.
Harriet - can you make sure that your team give these out at some point in
week 1?

Hopefully that will work.

Many thanks everyone.

*Thanks*

"","","Remote desktop issues - unable to install SIMS","Hi,

I am trying to update SIMS on our remote server, however Solus3 won't
install; the error I get through Solus is ""access denied"":
[image: image.png]

There are firewall rules in place which should (and have previously been)
sufficient.

Solus should automatically update SIMS; I have had issues with some devices
not doing this automatically however re-installing Solus usually gets round
it.

I did try disabling the firewall temporarily to see if that would fix it,
but that booted me out of the remote session and I have been unable to log
back in or reboot the server, so am now stuck.

If someone can help us to get the server back up and get Solus installed on
it that would be great. It may be the case that we need to enlist the help
of the SIMS helpdesk to get Solus to install, but I suspect it's a
firewall/permissions issue, rather than a SIMS issue.

I am not in this afternoon and I don't work Fridays, but my colleague Kyle
will be available until about 3pm; I have copied  him into this email.

Thanks,

@itsupport@ahs.pmat.academy Do ITT students get a different password to log  
into their emails? I might just need to delete this column, if not.
_Assigned to you_

Rachid Lazrak

good idea, just to hide the initial password column.

So who has the new Year 7 IT logins? Are they on a spreadsheet somewhere?
Will the office be able to put them on stickers for us?
Harriet - the first reading tests for Y7 are in week 2 so these stickers

Hi All,

Andrew Hunter resigned from the governing board after the last FGB on Wed 17th July.

Can you please do what you need to do to remove him from your records as an active governor?
Andrew left the board because of looking for new employment opportunities that will take him away from York.

Kind regards,

Jo Olsen (she/her)

"","","Switch User not working","Hi

We are now hot desking at Poppleton and have come across an issue
where when a user locks their computer we are unable to 'switch user'
Control/alt/delete doesn't work. The only way we can log someone off and
switch to a new user is to hold the start button. This obviously then loses
all the open screens of the previous user. I also believe that this is not
the right way to switch users.

It happen with my machine and both machines in the office

"","","Re: Help with Y7 IT logins","Hi Sam

They have always been given them in the first IT lesson to support them
with getting logged on and identifying any issues, missing accounts etc.

We can hand out the logins on the first day but I do not have them and Year
7 receives a lot of information on this day. If they can get them on the
first day could this please be something they put straight into their
planner and easy for form tutors to manage as they have a lot to
do/handout/go through on this day and I am conscious of this. They will not
be able to practise logging in prior to the English lesson too which may
take considerable time.

Thanks
Harriet

Dear Colleagues



We are now in a position to share the School Calendar for 2023.24 with the whole staffing body. I have attached a PDF version, but as trip details are provided by departments some details may change (although key dates such as CAF’s, WSTLF, Training days and parents’ evenings won’t). Hopefully this will allow you to plan ahead. Please be aware that we still don’t have the confirmed date for the Y6 Open Evening from the Local Authority. I am chasing this and as soon as I have it then I will let you know.



James has kindly provided me with some instructions on how to access the School Calendar on Outlook, these are outlined below:



How to Add the 2023-2024 Huntington School Calendar



•         Step One: Open the Outlook desktop app (It will not work if using the web version of Outlook.)



•         Step Two: Click the three dots near the bottom left of Outlook, then select folders.





[cid:image001.jpg@01DAD83A.1F644A20]



•         Step Three: Scroll down the left-hand side panel until you see Public Folders, click the small ‘>’ arrow, the again click the next small ‘>’ beside All Public Folders.



•         Step Four: Once you have found the shared folder that says Huntington School Calendar 2023-2024, RIGHT click on it, then select add to favourites.





[cid:image002.jpg@01DAD83A.1F644A20]





•         Step Five: You now need to go to the calendar view at the bottom left of Outlook, click the small ‘>’ next to Other Calendars, then click the tick box for the Huntington School Calendar 2023-2024 and it should now appear in the main calendar view.

I hope you’re very well. 

I’m just writing to give you further info on the IT problems I’m having, after being put in contact with you by Jacqui. 

On the Induction Day in June I managed to log into the systems all okay, but yesterday I tried to log in to my Outlook Email (and from there the desktop) and couldn’t. 

I’ve assumed that my email is dryan@ahs.pmat.academy and gone from there. I’ve tried the passwords given to me on the Induction day (I’ll attach them to this email as images) alongside my own password that I was prompted to change the system to (either Pineapple1996 or Pineapple 1996!). However, it’s coming up as either a wrong password or wrong username. 

I’d appreciate any help possible with this, as I’d really like to access my emails and the Staff Drive through the Remote Desktop over the summer. Thank you! 

All my best,
Dominic Ryan

I understand that you were helping Rachel today with her MFA. Apparently

Wonde there's a force reset password on next login, but I don't want

Is there a way for you to force accounts only 6 months old and
younger/future wise to have to create a new password when they login for
the first time going forward?

"","","Fwd: Smoothwall configuration","Hello James and Vital team,
Sarah M said I should ask you this question rather than her....

Can I pick your brains about how smoothwall works at Huntington?
I've copied in my personal email, ready for when I get cut off from my school email in a couple of days.

In the Music dept we create teaching resources that feature embedded YouTube links. It's our bread and butter and it all works a treat. And thanks very much.

Turns out that this isn't the case in all schools. Some music depts I'm working with in other schools can't get any access to YouTube. It's completely blocked.

So, my question is this....
Is there is a standard configuration that can be applied to Smoothwall to allow access to YouTube by teachers in a music department?

Could you give me some advice, or give me some tips, or point me at some useful articles that will help me advise other music depts on how best to approach the problem?

Thanks,

"","","Fwd: Welcome to SafeWeb","Good afternoon,

We have received this email from Cobus about a subscription for safeweb.
When I queried it with Newlands they said they don't know who would have
signed up for this as it wasn't the admin staff or the head/deputy head.

I just want to double check this isn't something Vital have been involved
with or where it is a potential phishing email before I click to terminate
it?

Kind regards,

Hi Elanor,

We have received this email about a COBUS subscription trial, I can't see
who has started the trial but I don't suppose this is something you might
know about?

Thanks,

Subject: Access to emails

Adam,

I’m asking advice on how we manage access to Anns emails?

It was arranged that the emails would be forwarded to my email address once she left until 31/8.

Ann has informed me that she can access the emails and the office account from her gmail accounts at home.

I am led to believe she has now deleted the shortcut she had on her personal computer but Abbie has asked me to enquire how this can be prevented but I am guessing whilst we have the email still open and being transferred to myself we cannot close the emails to anyone logging in again.

I think this was more a GDPR worry in case there was something confidential being read by her now she had left the company.

Apologies if you’re not the right one to answer but appreciate a response to clarify.

Many thanks
Michelle

I am hoping that someone could come to Sigglesthorne Primary Academy and
take a look at the connection disc in my classroom. It doesn't seem to be

to the internet/the signal quickly disappears.

the same question and looking to purchase something ASAP.

GPS - is also just doing the DPIA for a new trial of AB Tutor, which also
works with Chromebooks - so this is something to keep an eye on

There is a cost involved, we would need to know how many teachers/devices
require the software.

I have added myself to this ticket as I would like to keep you

[Keep your SIMS server ON this summer]

Hi Claire,

Over the summer holidays, Wonde will be working behind the scenes to ensure the connection between third party application(s) and the Capita SIMS server at Huntington School is kept active and up-to-date.

"","","Saving videos help request?","Hi James,

We have been paid members of Voice 21 for 2 years. As a school we are having a break with the subscription for next year but still developing the work.

I have downloaded the resources that we will need to keep this work going, but I don't seem to be able to save the videos.


Ideally I need all of the video saving from the 'resources' category.
The link to it is here Resources - Voice 21 Exchange<https://exchange.voice21.org/resources/?phase=secondary>

My password to access it is here

Is there anything that can be done as some of these videos will be really useful for further staff training.

I am in school tomorrow during registration and not teaching period 2 and 3 and will be in my office if you are able to help.

Many thanks in advance

"","","New Ticket - 15/07/2024 15:52","Just to add to my previous email, I think the reason I could access the
server from my colleague's account is because she was using a standalone PC.
This may or may not be of interest to you so I thought I'd mention it.  I'm
assuming the PC has a lead that connects to the server and the laptops
don't.  But as the server is clearly online - see below -  that made me
think about the time when a cleaner switched the wifi off in an upstairs
classroom and nobody knew.
So I thought I'd mention it.

"","","no access to server","Good afternoon

Would someone be able to check my account for issues.
I have been unable to access the school server all day.
I've tried numerous laptops and have rebooted numerous times.

This has meant that I can't download important documents to send as
attachments and I am unable to access the printer as this is attached to
the server.  I have a lot of SEND deadlines to meet by the end of today and
the end of tomorrow. I just assumed it was a problem with the server but my
colleagues all seem to have access to it without any issues.

Would someone be able to look at this asap?
Thank you

Digital - Microsoft 365
Office 365 A1 Plus for education will retire on August 1 2024

Office 365 A1 Plus is being retired by Microsoft to ensure schools have
compliant licensing plans, and to support the transition to cloud licences
Microsoft 365 A3 and Microsoft 365 A5. Microsoft Office 365 A1 Plus program
is an Office subscription that includes Office desktop apps for qualified
schools that purchased Office institution-wide for faculty and staff.

Previously any school who purchased an Open Value Subscription Education
Solutions (OVS-ES) annual volume licence agreement would get the Office 365
A1 Plus licence added to their Microsoft 365 Tenancy. Find out more here.
<https://nyes.info/Newsletter/ExternalLink/208501?source=newsletter&guid=293C9405-B48E-4EDF-96D7-81C7029245EF>

If you have a Software and Infrastructure contract with NYES Digital, no
further action is required. The support team will check the licences for
you.

What happens if you don’t have the above contract?

Then…
If you’d like to check yourself, you can do this from the Microsoft 365
Admin Portal.

   1. Navigate to the M365 Admin Portal https://admin.microsoft.com
   <https://nyes.info/Newsletter/ExternalLink/208502?source=newsletter&guid=293C9405-B48E-4EDF-96D7-81C7029245EF>
-
   Login as your school's Microsoft 365 Administrator.
   2. On the left-hand navigation menu, go to Billing > Licenses.
   3. Look for Office 365 A1 Plus for Faculty and Office 365 A1 Plus for
   Student assigned licenses.

You will be currently using one of the following:

*Office 365 A1*
Free online Office productivity and learning tools. Includes online web
versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Microsoft Teams, and
additional classroom tools.
*Office 365 A1 Plus *
Offers everything that comes with Office 365 A1 and also includes the full
desktop apps for Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook) not
just the online web versions.

*After all existing Office 365 A1 Plus licences expire on August 1st, 2024,
schools will have the choice to:*

1. If the school has an active Microsoft OVS-ES volume licence agreement,
which includes the Desktop apps:

   1. Anyone with an A1 Plus licence after August 1st will need to be moved
   to an Office 365 A1 licence, the Office 365 A1 licences are free to schools.
   2. Request Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise licences added to the
   school Tenancy. This will add licences for the full Office Desktop apps.
   3. Assign M365 Apps for Enterprise to staff and students who require
   licences for the full desktop Office applications.

2. If the school does not have a valid OVS-ES agreement, the school can
purchase Microsoft 365 Education Cloud Solution Provided (CSP) A3 and A5
licences.


Do you have an Software and Infrastructure Service Level Agreement with
NYES Digital?

*Yes and have an active OVS-ES:*

   - NYES Digital will move all your Office 365 A1 Plus licensed users to
   Office 365 A1
   - NYES Digital will add the Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise to your
   Microsoft 365 Tenancy
   - NYES Digital will assign the Microsoft 365 Apps to the schools users
   who previously had A1 Plus licences.

*Yes but do not have an active OVS-ES agreement:*

   - NYES Digital will move all your Office A1 Plus licensed users to
   Office A1
   - NYES Digital will provide a quote for Microsoft 365 A3 licences for
   your Faculty and Students.

Customers with a Software and Infrastructure Service level Agreement with
NYES Digital will not need to do anything. NYES Digital will move your
licenses for you and if you have volume license OVS-ES agreement we will
ensure that your staff are provided with the Microsoft 365 Apps.

*No, you are not yet a customer of NYES Digital *
Please contact - nyes.digital@northyorks.gov.uk
<https://nyes.info/Newsletter/ExternalLink/211053?source=newsletter&guid=293C9405-B48E-4EDF-96D7-81C7029245EF>
and request a quote to manage your Microsoft 365 Tenancy, we will also be
able to provide you with Microsoft 365 A3 licences.

Should you have any questions or want to know more about the transition
process, please do not hesitate to contact our NYES Digital support team.

"","","Re: URGENT - Casting Problem","Hello again,

I did call but just to let you know the problem has seemed to have solved
it self for now - typical technology. We replugged in the Owl after leaving
the TV on for a while and the correct TV came up in the sources to cast. We
do have a HDMI cable as a backup in case it decides to be wobbly again.

All the best,

Oliver.

We have a laptop that won't log onto our system.  It lets you put your name and password in and wizzes for a while but then comes up with the message in the attached photo.  I have updated it and restarted it but that didn't work.  It also makes a weird fizzing noise when it is starting up!

Please could someone let  me know how to fix it, or send someone out to have a look?

Thank you for your help.

* Horizon Programming Sheet - Please ask Josh if he wants 3 filling out, one for each site or a joint one, when he attends site

I will be sending you 3 separate Letter of Authority via Adobe signature - please can you sign these when you can?

I have provisionally scheduled Josh to attend sites next week - I will confirm once I have spoken to him.

A few requests:


  1.
Please can you let me know when I will have login details for the new starters in September (both Y7 and the 9 other starters in different year groups)
  2.
Could I have a list for each year group of students username & email address (along with names and form groups) as a spreadsheet? If possible could this include the ClassCharts pupil code (if not I can add this in afterwards)
  3.
Could you make a slight adjustment to the new 6th form badge
The wording in red should read ""Wear this on your lanyard at all times when in school""

Thank you James!

"","","Video Editing","C Dixon
08:00 (31 minutes ago)
to me

Hi Craig, I wasn't sure who I needed to email about this but I have outlined the reasons why I need a laptop below.

The Animal Care Tech Award requires students to submit edited videos as part of their coursework. Over the last year I have been editing these at home, I have navigated my way through this process by getting out an old computer from my loft and setting it up in my bedroom. I have very little space and therefore it has been uncomfortable, I don't have a table in my bedroom, living room or kitchen and have been editing on the floor between my bed and the wall.

Each video takes on average 20 - 30 minutes to edit as they are 10 minutes long. I edit two videos per student over each moderation period, there are two moderation periods over the two years. This year I have two year 10 groups running alongside the yr 11s, resulting in the number of videos I will have to edit being greater than last year.

I have been using my own computer as I use CapCut to edit, this is not currently available in school. I also don't have enough time in the school day to do this at work therefore I had no choice other than to use my old computer last year so that the students could pass the course, due to a tight turnover

I would greatly appreciate a school laptop, with a big enough screen to edit on a timeline, and CapCut installed so that I can comfortably do this at home. The laptop would need enough hard drive space to store videos as I edit. I have tried out other editing software and found that I am more confident and fast with CapCut.

Please would you consider providing me with a laptop for these reasons so that I can work comfortably and efficiently. This will result in better time management for me and ensure videos are edited more effectively.

Let me know if you need anymore information.

Thank you!

   Hi Abbie,

   We seem to only be having an issue with the SMTP credentials. It is
   using gmail and we require the password to be able to continue to use that.
   Would you be able to ask your IT to provide that information?

   Many thanks

"","","Smoothwall on iPads","Good afternoon,
I recently had a session introducing the new Smoothwall monitoring
dashboard. During the training, I asked the question about the monitoring
of iPads. My understanding is that they need something specific to allow
monitoring to happen. Please can this be addressed in Skelton as we have
several iPads used in classrooms and After School club?
Many thanks,

We've got some very special guests (copied in) coming to Manor on Tuesday
to explore our Music workstations. Please can you do whatever is needed at
your end to make it possible for them to login to workstations using their
HSLT email addresses - it could be this is possible anyway, but I thought
I'd ask just to make sure everyone has that opportunity when we're
together.

Everyone copied in - no experience necessary, I'll show you how everything
works and you'll love it! If you have your own headphones to bring, for
your own comfort, please bring them. We have 1/4 inch and mini jack
headphone sockets to plug into.

Carl, any problems let me know

Hello Clair,

We have been notified that the SIMS workstation application has been updated. (Huntington School - YO32 9WT)

For InVentry/SIMS to sync data correctly, we must ensure the InVentry SIMS Connector service is updated using Admin.

Your local IT support will need to perform the update on the SIMS server or on the local InVentry system. (depending on where the SIMS connector service is installed)

You can find the location within the Console Settings > Integrations menu.

[https://inventry.zendesk.com/attachments/token/XrdKNvSvg3wZIIVkUo5hGnu3y/?name=inline1131393771.png]

We have included a tool to download and run on the SIMS server to perform the update.

Please refer to the below video tutorial on how to run the updater.

SIMS Installer video on Vimeo<https://vimeo.com/956546970/b48d98ec51?share=copy>

If you run into any issues applying the update, please contact our support team on 0113 322 9253 (Option 3)

Kind regards,
Sachin.

"","","Failed log-in","Hi

I am unable to use Chrome to log into my NSJ account. I was using it today,
and at 3.30 ish my laptop froze.  When I restarted it, rebooted and made
sure all updates were cleared, the laptop will allow me to sign in, but
google chrome just goes blank - it will not allow me to access Google
Drive, gmail etc.
Strangely I can log into my NSJ account from the Microsoft edge browser.
It will also let me log into my old ASA profile on Chrome.

Please help as there are certain docs that prefer Chrome.  Equally I just
don't' understand why its changed!
Thanks

Subject: Re: Ebor email account problems
To: Wendy Harrington <w.harrington@ebor.academy>


Dear Wendy,

Initially (months) all was well, then suddenly my password was rejected.
Since then every time my password to log into the Google email account for
ebor is reset, to overcome the previous rejection, the new password is
subsequently rejected. I am told this is due to a change in access policy
concerning the use of mail forwarding, which I had set up early on as I am
not in the habit of using Google services for anything, and it was much
more useful to have ebor mail appearing in my main mailbox. If this is no
longer allowed it is disappointing, but life goes on. However, I am
obviously unable to access my ebor mail account to switch off the offending
forwarding policy (if that is the cause of the issue—if it is it does seem
a bit unnecessary).

Hopefully all of that is enough to work with, but please do get back to me
as needed.

Regards, Alisdair.

Good evening Alaisdair
Josie Speck tells me you are having problems with your email account. Can
you tell me what the issue is please. Have you just lost access, forgot a
password or is it something to do with setting up multi factor
authentication? have you lost access to everything or just the drive? Once
I know what the problem is I will pass it on to someone to help you sort it.

Best wishes
Wendy

"","","New email address","Hi James

Could you please create an email address that the Chair and Vice Chair of Governors can access and call it:

cog@huntington-ed.org.uk<mailto:cog@huntington-ed.org.uk>

This should be accessible by George Edmond and Chris Wass.

They both tell me that they access their emails both via a PC and their phone. Given that they access it on their phone perhaps a separate email address with a password that they can add would be best.

Hope all this makes sense.

Once created could you please email them the login details?

Many thanks

"","","Chromebooks - all please read","Hi All,

Following on from Hannah's message in the bulletin, I want to reiterate the
importance of returning your chromebooks to specific trolleys, or directly
to Giles or Rashid on the Food Tech corridor in IT Support, or Hannah
Flavell in Sixth Form.

As of September, we will be testing the reading ages of all Yr7-9 students
in English lessons and need to use two trolleys for 3 weeks. This test will
be repeated again in the spring term and again in the summer term. The
first tests are due to start on the first Thursday back. Timetabling NGRT
is a very challenging job for Becky to organise logistically, given we will
be testing 900+ students, so we need to know we have enough chromebooks to
accommodate testing asap.

We'd all rather be in a position whereby we have enough chromebooks in
school so that NGRT testing can happen, with staff still able to access
additional chromebooks for their lessons. We won't be able to facilitate
this if we don't know how many we have, but *NGRT testing will take
priority.*

Please check carefully in your classrooms and departments for any
chromebooks - return them to the trolley they came from, Giles/Rachid (in
IT), or Hannah Flavell (Sixth Form).

Any chromebooks not returned will be disabled, which doesn't benefit any
of us.

Thanks for your understanding and cooperation - Becky and I really value
your support in helping us with this.

"","","Governance Adviser - attendance at PMAT Office","From ""Wilson, Liz"" <Liz.Wilson@york.gov.uk>: Hello, I wondered if someone would be able to help me tomorrow when I am planning to work in the PMAT Office from 11am to 3pm?

On previous occasions I've been unable to access your Wi-Fi (I think because CYC blocks it) and have had to hotspot which isn't ideal. I wondered if I would be able to connect via BYOD - as I've been able to with other Trusts I've worked with.

Any help would be appreciated!

Please note my usual working pattern is Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, term time only.

"","","Teams hyperlink issue","Hi James

I think the Teams issue with cover work came from the fact that my email was imported directly into the cover folders. I've just dragged in a Word doc with the same info into Fri 12th July folder and it automatically opened in an external browser, meaning the links opened in the browser too - all fine.

Can you just double check that from where you are, open the I Wilson Test word doc and see if the same thing happens? That would prevent all the upheaval of us converting many, many G slides to PP.

Thanks
Ian

Hello,

Our assistant head teacher leaves next week (Vicky Hearson) but has asked if she can keep her email address open until October half term?

The reason being is that she has been here so long, she gets tons of emails and would still be checking them for a few weeks and passing them on to the next relevant person so nothing gets missed.

Please let us know if this is possible?

Her email address is v.hearson@ebor.academy<mailto:v.hearson@ebor.academy>

Many thanks,

"","","St Barnabas being added to YE shared drive","From ""yorkeducation@york.gov.uk"" <yorkeducation@york.gov.uk>: Hi Rob,
I am hoping you may be able to help – please can you refer to the email below. For me to add St Barnabas to the YE shared drives I need to know the staff group to add. Are you able to provide this for me along with the correct domain name, or should I request it from St Barnabas primary school?

There are also a few other staff groups I’m missing (and hence why I was struggling to add any earlier in the week, but at least I have made progress) for the 6 schools I am  struggling to add I have asked the schools direct for the correct staff group names. This means they may be in contact with you / Vital to clarify the group name.

Thanks very much for your help

I’ve spoken to Steve at Vital and he’ll make the necessary arrangements. I’ve also copied in the headteacher so that they are also aware.

Hello Michelle,
Hope you are well

We are in the process of making some changes to how schools access the documents which are currently available through our York Education website.  Going forward from 1st September we will be sharing documents using Google Drive.

St Barnabas, have been accessing some documents through YE and I am keen for them to continue to have access from 1st September through Google drive and set in place arrangements regardless of conversion timelines. To do this I need support from Pathfinder, since St Barnabas are on the pmat domain.

I understand its technically possible for Vital to set this up, but I require permission from Pathfinder to add the yorkeducation.net<http://yorkeducation.net> domain to the trusted domain list for PMAT, so that St Barnabas’ All.staff group can access documents through the shared drive. I shall also seek permission from St Barnabas too.

These documents contain non-personal / non-confidential information and relate to the documents that the traded services share when schools buy their service, such as HR / Payroll /Finance,  templates, forms, guidance. The documents are view only and can be downloaded by schools for their use. We are not proposing to use Google Drive for schools to upload documents at this stage.

Please can you let me know if you are the correct person for me to contact regarding my request and if you would be happy to provide permission for Vital to set this up. Obviously if you have any queries please do not hesitate to ask.

Kind Regards
Jean

issues.

Firstly, I am not signed in on anything on my phone with my work account
(mail, drive etc) but for some reason I cannot access my home central
heating app! I have the Nest Google thermostat and I use my personal gmail
account for this (have never connected my work email) but  it is somehow
blocked by Ebor.
I do not go on the school wifi with my phone and this happened at home. I
have attached a photo. There is no option for me to change to my personal
account.

Secondly, I have downloaded the Authenticator app and it is saying that my
account does not exist. Photo attached.

I seem to recall a conversation earlier in the year where you mentioned changing the Y11 lunch passes, so they look completely different to the current ones.



They currently look like this:

Hi

Is it possible for me to have another computer set up in my office?  When
reports are generating I cannot do anything else in SIMS, the KS3 reports
are taking approx 40 minutes to generate and it stops me from getting on
with other things...

There are a couple of websites that I use for computing that are being

to the safe list? I have used them both previously for our ks1 coding and
debugging computing topic. (I would really appreciate it if we could access
these this week.)

https://botlogic.us/
https://www.tynker.com/

Also an extension on my teacher pc has been removed. It is the writer
extension that allows me to write on google slides. I'm currently just
using the pen function on slides, however it is too thick for handwriting
and doesn't have the functions of the writer extension (the logo was a red
pen, if that helps).

"","","Full drive","Hi

I have noticed that our Admin Shared Drive (O) is full, I know that when
this happened before the issue was solved by asking everyone to delete
downloads which I will do, but I just wanted to check if you can see if
there are any other folders that look particularly full?

Many thanks

Morning Michelle, Jo



You all now have access to the relevant channel in the Tang Hall Teams
site.  If you’re able to take a few minutes to set up your access, it would
be really appreciated, as I can then share the design drawings and
documents with you, without emailing large files across to you both.



Please let me know if there are any problems and I’ll try my best to help.



Link to folder access is below, which can be used once you’ve followed the
attached guidance and additional guidance in bold below.



EXTERNAL - SRP1110 - Tang Hall Primary Academy | 04-DfE_School | Microsoft
Teams
<https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Ad072df602ecf43309e4c5f80056a6a0b%40thread.tacv2/04-DfE_School?groupId=e5d33d1f-b57a-4cd1-9cef-c17a5e49b54e&tenantId=fad277c9-c60a-4da1-b5f3-b3b8b34a82f9&ngc=true>



Please follow the attached guidance to access the site.  Additional
guidance has also been issued by IT helpdesk in case you are having any
issues.  See below:





*Additional guidance for Teams external access provided by Unified
Communications Team is below : The guest user will be required to click on
the invitation link the DfE has sent to them; they will then be asked to
accept the terms and conditions and set up multi factor authentication. If
required they may wish to click 'set up another method' at the bottom and
choose the 'Phone' and then 'Text' option. Once they've got access, they
will be taken to a page that says 'My work apps'. They can ignore this, and
instead go back to their emails and look for an email which has the link to
the Team. They will then be required to click this and then accept the
terms of use. (If the user can't find this link, the owner of the team will
be required to send them the link to the Team.) If when clicking the link,
it says can't find this page, they will be required to open it in the web
app. Next steps will be to restart the Teams app, they should now click on
their profile photo in Teams in the top right, they will then see the
Department for Education account there where they can access the external
Teams' sites. If the user still can't access in the desktop app, ask them
to click on their profile photo in the web version to see if they can
access from here instead.*

For what they lack in size, some of the countries of Central America have surprisingly large populations. Guatemala, for example, has over 16 million people, and Honduras has nine million of its own. Only Belize, with a population of under 400,000, fails to make the three million mark. Belize also has the distinction of being the only Central American country where English is the sole official language.A mnemonic to memorize all the countries of Central America and also the order in which they are located from north to south is: Big Gorillas Eat Hotdogs, Not Cold Pizza!If you want to practice offline, download our printable Central America maps in pdf format.

Thank you for letting me know about this. As the printers require you to

necessarily consider this a GDPR risk, however if you believe these are
printing out elsewhere please let me know.

Vital - please could you assist Julie urgently with this as the ability to

The CYC school finance team are moving all their documents kept on York Education on to google drive this summer, which means I'm going to need access. My manager has asked that I get access through one of my schools. I've spoken to Andrew and he's happy that I get included with Elvington. Are you able to set me up with a login/password to access this please?

Hi Rob,
All the school domains have already been added to the allowlisted domains section, and you can view the list of domain names there.  I’m not sure what the white list is, but it seams strange to me that I added Dringhouses with no problem at all when I was testing the process in June and I am wondering if anything has happen since that may cause the issue.

Hi Jean

I have just seen your email about issues with sharing files with some schools.

It is likely that we need to add all the domains to the whitelist for you, do you have a list of the school domains you need to share with? This will be the part of the email address after the @ symbol.

I will also remove the finance group for you as well.

I have been asked by Andrew Hill to install our new timetable.

I have come unstuck on the first set of instructions (I've attached them so
that you see if I need anything more sorting than I am currently aware
of).  The issue is that I don't know where to find currmatch.exe on our
system.  Please could one of you tell me where to find it or if you know I
don't have it, please can it be installed at your earliest convenience?

Thanks

Andrew Daly is having issues accessing Decision Time. He needed a password
reset, however the password reset email is never received by Andrew's
Pathfinder emails (adaly@pmat.academy), and they haven't gone into the spam
folder either.

We haven't had any issues regarding Pathfinder accounts not receiving
emails from Decision Time (that I know of), however our Governance Advisor
has informed us of a similar situation previously with HSLT, where Decision
Time emails were being blocked by Google even though it had been
whitelisted and you were able to provide a solution.

Please could you have a look into this to ensure the same issue isn't
happening with us, or if it is, implement the solution so this can
be resolved?

Any advice would be much appreciated.

Many thanks,
Mia

"","","Y7-9 reading tests IT login in Sept","Hi

I'm trying to timetable the Y7-9 reading tests at the start of the autumn
term. For these tests, they need to access a Chromebook.

Please can I check the following?
-when do the new Year 7s get their IT login details? Is it the first day or
do we have to wait for them to have their first IT lesson?
-do Year 8 and Year 9 IT login details remain the same so they can access
CBs as they would now?

*Thanks*

"","","Pathfinder Meeting Room - Camera & Speaker Connection","Hi Rachid,

As discussed, the IT in our meeting room (camera/speaker/Zoom meeting
connections) sometimes has issues if there is a meeting taking place
earlier in the morning (i.e 9 - 9.30am).

Recently, it displayed a message saying there was a bandwidth issue. I know
you have mentioned this is likely due to the network being busy between
these times, however I am just raising this on a ticket as you requested.

Many thanks
Mia

Can I please ask, is there anyway that one of our employees can log onto a
PC whilst in school to receive her payslips via protected e-mails, if she
does not have a mobile phone?

I think she needs the MFA to access google in the first place, is that
correct?

Thank you

"","","Remote access","Hello,

I will be a new staff member starting in September, but I have been given
log on details already.

However when I try to access email or google drive, or the remote access
through AHS website from home, a message appears saying I cann access this
right now and it may be restricted by admin.

Is there something I can do to be able to access things from home?

Many thanks,

Emily Sparke.

Subject: Edulink SIMS Critical DLL error
To: <g.ketley@asa.hslt.academy>



Good morning,
We have noticed on our monitoring that our EduLink agent is still reporting a SIMS Critical error.



This error usually relates to the Edulink Agent server requiring a reboot after a SIMS database upgrade. SIMS upgrade does not update DLLs if they are locked. So when the server is rebooted this will release the DLLs and update them.

Kind regards,

Gabi

Kind of Good news. Its not a cyber security breach.



It is an error on the admin team. So we are investigating as a GDPR breach
and you will be receiving an email telling you to delete the original email.

Thanks for raising it.

Thanks for passing this on. We have had an IT failure (a leak took out some
of the systems and I suspect that this could be some one taking advantage).



I suggest you report this to your Cyber team too.



Nice to hear from you anyway!

Hi Michaela



Long time, no contact!  Hope you are keeping well?



I just wanted to let you know that I had an email from Lady Lumley's that I
wasn't expecting so I just wanted to check if it was legit or actually a
phishing email from someone else.

This is a screenshot of the email (I haven't clicked on the report)

We had a cyber attack in Dec22 so I am always extremely cautious with email
recipients and contents and would rather check it out and also let you know
in case this is something that affects your Trust



My granddaughter does attend Lady Lumley's and I was added as one of her
emergency contacts - however they have hardly ever contacted me directly or
sent me reports as they always go to her Mum.so I really would not expect
to receive anything.

It was sent to me on my old Grahamschool.org email address and the email
address it was sent from is shown as:

Phish Threat
This wasn’t a real attack, but it could have been.

Welcome to Sophos Phish Threat. In cooperation with your organization,
Phish Threat performs simulated attacks just like this one to
educate employees on the dangers of phishing and social engineering.

Because you fell for this simulated attack, your administrator has enrolled
you in a brief training. Follow the prompts below to complete the required
training.

Go to training <https://staysafe.sophos.com/course/phishing-interactive_en/>

*Full disclosure:* Training progress is recorded and reported to your
administrator. Don’t say we didn’t warn you!
P.S. Keep this quiet for now. Not everyone has checked their email, and we
wouldn’t want them to have an unfair advantage.

I've just got this email and I don't know whether it is actually from
google or not but it seems concerning. Another member of staff also
received this email this morning from the same location in Russia. I
haven't clicked anything but just thought I'd make you aware.

"","","VNC","Hi Holly,
Can I just check about VNC TeamViewer. It always used to be free for up to 5 devices. 2 schools have said they have been/are being charged £80 for VNC now, even when it is on fewer devices.
Thanks,

as discussed yesterday, could we please have some additional Chromebooks?
We won't need a new Chromebook trolley but it would be great to get them
with chargers.

Could we please have an additional 10 Chromebooks:

2x library
1x Support Assistant
2x Admin
5x Screening

I won't be in my office today. Maybe we can sort it out tomorrow?

Thank you,

"","","Parentmail Issue-balance wrong on Parentmail again","Hi Craig

We have another issue with another student balance not showing correctly on
the Parentmail side.
I have contacted them, and they have AGAIN opened a case: 00386000
(transcript attached)

The student name is: Olivia Stolarz
I have attached a report from the till side showing the correct balance.

We can't do this every time a parent tops up, it is far too time-consuming
for all involved.

If you could please investigate this when possible.

Thank you

"","","Fwd: [External] Checking re an email I've received from Lady Lumleys.","Hello

I received an email from Lady Lumleys which was very unexpected.
I have investigated further and it is definitely a scam so I wanted to
advise you. It is very concerning as it has an attachment which might be
clicked by someone who does have a child in this area who attends that
school.

It’s a scam – I will report it our side.

Thanks for passing this on. We have had an IT failure (a leak took out some
of the systems and I suspect that this could be some one taking advantage).



I suggest you report this to your Cyber team too.



Nice to hear from you anyway!

Hi Michaela



Long time, no contact!  Hope you are keeping well?



I just wanted to let you know that I had an email from Lady Lumley's that I
wasn't expecting so I just wanted to check if it was legit or actually a
phishing email from someone else.

This is a screenshot of the email (I haven't clicked on the report)

We had a cyber attack in Dec22 so I am always extremely cautious with email
recipients and contents and would rather check it out and also let you know
in case this is something that affects your Trust



My granddaughter does attend Lady Lumley's and I was added as one of her
emergency contacts - however they have hardly ever contacted me directly or
sent me reports as they always go to her Mum.so I really would not expect
to receive anything.

It was sent to me on my old Grahamschool.org email address and the email
address it was sent from is shown as:

"","","IWB help!","Hello,

You recently transferred the IWBs at St Lawrence's Primary School from 1
classroom to another. Unfortunately, my laptop isn't connecting
correctly to the IWB in the Year 2 classroom now, and the screen just keeps
flashing on and off!

My job-share's laptop does work using this same HDMI cable and port. I have
tried moving the HDMI cable and using the one on the front of the IWB, and
it works, however this isn't ideal as we will have children getting up and
using the board, so we don't want a wire going across the front.

I have tried restarting the board, and restarting the laptop but it still
isn't working! If someone could come in and look at this ASAP, I'd really
appreciate it.

Thanks, Sarah Griffiths (St Lawrence's Primary School, Year 1/2)

I thought as much, which is what is causing the confusion.  Nothing has changed with regards to filtering, consequently if it’s worked before it still should.

We’ll have to wait and see what Vital and North manage to find.

Kind regards

Hi Leigh,


Here at Danesgate - I'm pretty sure we got it working across the site with both word and google for student and teacher logins as we didn't want to commit to purchase until we were sure it would work.

Thank you for your help,

Louise

Hi Louise,

Can I just confirm where the trial was conducted?

Marcus,

In order to take this forward I need to arrange for one of the Vital engineers to be onsite with North to conduct testing and identify the issue.  The URL’s listed in the TextHelp documentation are already whitelisted, so there must be something else going on.  Could you please arrange for an engineer to visit and I will arrange for North to be available for testing?

Hi Leigh,

We have contacted the Texthelp support team as we still have glitches with the Read&Write software.  Marcus advises us that it is a CYC internet permission issue.

Would it be possible to liaise with TextHelp to work out which of the URLs need whitelisting to allow the following functions:

In Word:  To allow the picture dictionary to work.
In Google:  To allow the vocab list and the highlighter collation to work.

There is a link in the email below from texthelp that may help - and their staff are very helpful also.   These functions did work for the trial so hopefully it is an easy fix.

Thank you,

Louise Stoneman

Hi,

This would mean that it is a filtering issue and would need to be resolved by CYC.

I was wondering if you might be able to help at all please.

I am trying to upload some photographs from a staff iPad from a trip yesterday.  On the other iPads, as usual, I have been able to sign in to Google Drive with my school email/password and upload the photographs to a file onGoogle Drive.  However, with one iPad, I cannot sign in, therefore, I cannot upload the photographs.  It says 'This Connection is Not Private'.

How can I get around this please as we no longer use wires?

Good afternoon,

So sorry for the issues with getting access to the shared folder for the
Morocco videos. We have encountered this as the trust system will not
allow anyone from outside the organisation to gain access. I hadn't
realised this until parents started emailing me.

Below is a new link which will go around that system and allow for videos
etc to be added. This is only live *until next Wednesday (10th July) *so
all videos need to be added before then so they can be saved to the laptop
ahead of departure.

Really sorry for the trouble, all a learning curve :) I hope this now
works.

Hi Claire,

We have Cameron Dedman starting a week today. I’ve e-mailed the admission form so hopefully be done in the next couple of days. He doesn’t do MFL so can this be blank? Jemma/Niall - I am going to organise him doing his core assessments so we can see where he is at academically in these gaps.

Y9 team will send you a form group across. I know you’re away from tomorrow so sorry to ask for this now!

Thanks

Tom

Would it be possible for me to have a network account for Naburn? – With at least access full access to their staff share/ home folders.



Ideally, a network privileged account so I can login to their DC/ file server. I have copied in Kate for confirmation of the request.

Please can I have some help on this, Sarah Cook has left St Barnabas

Can this be changed so that we can access all the office systems and

"","","Smoothwall issues at YHS","Hi

We are experiencing several issues which NYES appear to be unable to
resolve. We aren't sure whose remit this falls within, however we are
wondering if Vital are in a position to either advise us, or liaise with
NYES, or assist in any other way?

Firstly, certain Gmail features/buttons (e.g. 'Compose') are inconsistently
unresponsive; this means students can struggle at times to do basic tasks
such as send emails. This can often be fixed by using a different computer
or web browser, but it causes frustration and confusion.

Secondly, mathsgenie.co.uk is unblocked however all clickable elements
(e.g. links/buttons/widgets) do not function.

And finally, all users logging on to Chromebook devices are categorised as
""default users"" (i.e. staff are only given student level filtering
policies).

Kyle did speak to someone at NYES regarding the first two issues; they
asked various questions relating to our network setup, which we aren't able
to comprehensively answer; would it be possible to arrange an online
meeting where we can hopefully discuss this further with NYES.

The last issue hasn't been logged with NYES yet; before we log it with
them, we are wondering if you know if this is something we need to simply
log with them, or do we need to give them any information to enable them to
resolve this? Or is it something you can either do yourselves or need to
liaise with NYES over?

Kind regards,

"","","Using a device on wifi","Good Evening,

We are just trying to set up a new amazon tablet and it does not seem to work on the 'TerringtonHall' wifi. We have tried using the Terrington-BYOD wifi network but it does not give us the option to put in our username and password in the same way it does on our phones (apple device). We live on site and someone was able to 'unblock' our fire stick for the TV and alexa... I think using an IP address perhaps, so that we could use them on the school wifi. Could this possibly be done for the tablet too?

Please see the email thread below.

Context: one of my new September teachers was in today and tried to login
to her NEPS emails while on site.  She has the authenticator app but it
just kept sending the messages below.  She is in school again on Wednesday
so any advice I can pass on to her then would be appreciated.

Thanks.

Hi Hannah,

Attached is the screenshot from earlier showing the message I get when I
try and log in to my emails.

The first is  my home laptop for logging onto emails, and the second is
when trying to log into the Microsoft authenticator app on my phone.

Thanks for the help to sort it and get me on!

At Scarcroft Primary School, we wish to encourage staff to have a healthy
work-life balance, and therefore we discourage the sending of emails
outside of the traditional working day. Where emails are received after
6pm, over the weekend or during a holiday period, it is likely that a

Hi Carl,

The Year 10 students are working on an enterprise project that requires them to use Walk Score:

https://www.walkscore.com/

I believe it is being blocked by smoothwall. It is just a website that works out the walkability of an area. Is there a way of adding it to the white list?

Many thanks,

Subject: Can Matteaus help please?
To: <help@vital.com>


Hi there,
I'm having trouble logging in to microsoft account with my Ebor login.
I have another account linked to a council email
nicky.bryan-smith@osbaldwick.yorkschools.net which also has 2 factor
authentication.
It won't seem to let me log into both simultaneously.

Can you help please?

Any chance I can use Teams as well?
I use this for a lot of multi agency meetings with the council, but
computer doesn't seem to let me have a profile.

many thanks

Nicky

Our next MAT Board meeting is scheduled to take place on Thursday 11 July,
6.30pm at St Barnabas CE Primary School. At the start of this meeting, we
would like to spend some time supporting Trustees with downloading the
Gmail app to access their Pathfinder account and receive email
notifications and support them to set up MFA.

We have produced a guide which has been shared with them, and the Chair
(John Hattam) is coming to our office this week to get his set up in
advance of the meeting.

Please could we arrange a technician from Vital to attend the beginning of
the meeting and support trustees with these IT arrangements?

Many thanks,

The devices I am using are stand alone desktops and HP laptops.

I am unsure if you have received my email regarding being unable to access websites through White Rose, but I have added the email to this incase you never received it.

I am also unable to watch any videos that 'White Rose Maths' have published on their website to support my students with their independent learning lessons. Please can this also be unblocked URGENTLY as it has always previously worked.

Here is a link for you to be able to work with, the videos are through the website 'vimeo'

We have a projector in our 5M classroom where the bulb is flashing, so we

We believe we have a bulb in an old projector which came out of a classroom

I've just found it but it is not working.

Carl, I don't suppose that you have something similar so that when we need
to quickly get students logged on for an assessment not knowing their login
isn't a barrier?

Also, are you able to tell me Cora's password please?

"","","Wi-fi access","Hi

I'm hoping that someone will be able to help me. I've spoken to Mike Gidley
and Jo Jones and I understand that there is a South Bank BYOD network for
wi-fi and I'd like to be able to connect to it via my android phone. Since
moving to the new offices i don't seem to be getting my text messages and
emails through straight away unless I pick up my phone (not sure if its
because i sit in the corner) and the 4G/signal is weak. It wouldn't
normally bother me but my Dad is in hospital and i need to know what's
going on.

If there is a way of connecting would you be able to send some instructions
over, my phone keeps asking for a certificate and then a domain? Too
technical for me lol!

To: Mrs Jones <jjones1@woodthorpe.southbank.academy>


Good morning,

My laptop is unable to print. This has been an issue for the last few weeks
however I have managed to get by. Ideally, I'd like it sorted by the end of
the year due to needing to print over summer.

Could you contact Vital to see if they could advise a solution?

Thanks,

Ruth x

"","","AO Holly re SWAY","This is from the Help foirum

The issue you reported seems to be related to the Service Incident. This issue was posted to the Service Health Dashboard (SHD) as incident SW806219 - Some users may experience slowness and intermittent issues in loading the Sway service, starting on Friday, June 28, 2024, at 7:53:08 PM (CST).
Title: Some users may experience slowness and intermittent issues in loading the Sway service

User impact: Users may experience slowness and intermittent issues in loading the Sway service.

Current status: We're reviewing service monitoring telemetry to isolate the source of the issue and establish a fix.

Scope of impact: Impact is specific to users who are served through the affected infrastructure attempting to load the Sway service.
You may contact your Microsoft 365 Administrator and go to the Service health - Microsoft 365 admin center<https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/servicehealth> to check if your tenant is affected by this Service Incident. If yes, please monitor it to get the latest information about it.
However, if your tenant is not affected by this Service Incident, as this seems like a temporarily server-side issue, please raise a support ticket to report this issue to the related team by raising a support ticket from Microsoft 365 Admin Center. Reference:  Get support - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-support?view=o365-worldwide>
The support team there has more permission than us, they may also involve more resources to investigate the issue from the backend. This would be the most efficient way to handle this case for you.

I have my Y10 class researching their GCSE presentations and they are
struggling because 'news' is blocked. I also have a student who can't
research medicine because 'medical information' is also blocked...This
seems bizarre to me. What's the rationale? Students should be able to
research what's going on in the world..?

Is there any way we can lift this so they can continue?

Hi Jacqui



Tim and I have spoken and the issue is that he cannot access his @ahs.pmat
email account in order to then receive the registration email from Decision
Time – which is required in order to set up a password and get access.



If there is any information that you can send Tim to support him accessing
his pmat email; tneale@ahs.pmat.academy that would  be really helpful. I
have copied in Tim’s personal email (with his permission) to send any
instructions to in order to get him set up. If that’s not possible then Tim
said he will try and get into school second half of next week. Once he has
access to his pmat email he should easily be able to register for DT.



Many Thanks



Helen

Yes no problem. I can see he is registered with the site but it’s showing

Hi Helen,



Tim Neale has just popped into school to enquire about access to the
governors' decisiontime site.

Can you help?

Hi Ben,

I believe the best way to resolve this would be for your IT to update the SSL certificate manually on the InVentry system with my below instructions.


1. _**On the sign in screen, triple click on the InVentry Logo on your home screen - this is usually in the bottom left of the screen**_
2. _**When the keypad appears enter the first 4 digits of your Anywhere ID (0632) or 1234**_
3. _**From the options that appear please select 'Shutdown InVentry', you will then see a normal PC desktop**_
4. _**An orange box will appear in the bottom right corner, please tap this then press 'Ok' in the window that appears in the centre of the screen (if you miss this the sign in screen will reload and you will need to complete the first 3 steps again.**_
5. _**Log off the InVentry_system user**_
6. _**Log onto the local admin user ""Inventry"" with the password ""Inventry1983"" (capital ""i"")**_
7. _**Run through steps 1-4 again to close down the software**_

Cut the ""Silent Installer"" folder to the below location.

C:\Program Files\Inventry\V4

Cut the 2 certificate files to the below location.

C:\Program Files\Inventry\V4\Service

Once the files are in the correct folders, go back into the ""Silent Installer"" and right click ""Run as administrator"" on the ""Silent Installer.exe""

This should then present a CMD prompt and confirm the results of the SSL certificate update.

You can also confirm this by opening a new CMD window and entering the below command.

Netsh HTTP show sslcert

Please note you will have to extract the .RAR files.

Kind regards,
Brett.

Hi Ben,

I believe the best way to resolve this would be for your IT to update the SSL certificate manually on the InVentry system with my below instructions.


1. _**On the sign in screen, triple click on the InVentry Logo on your home screen - this is usually in the bottom left of the screen**_
2. _**When the keypad appears enter the first 4 digits of your Anywhere ID (0632) or 1234**_
3. _**From the options that appear please select 'Shutdown InVentry', you will then see a normal PC desktop**_
4. _**An orange box will appear in the bottom right corner, please tap this then press 'Ok' in the window that appears in the centre of the screen (if you miss this the sign in screen will reload and you will need to complete the first 3 steps again.**_
5. _**Log off the InVentry_system user**_
6. _**Log onto the local admin user ""Inventry"" with the password ""Inventry1983"" (capital ""i"")**_
7. _**Run through steps 1-4 again to close down the software**_

Cut the ""Silent Installer"" folder to the below location.

C:\Program Files\Inventry\V4

Cut the 2 certificate files to the below location.

C:\Program Files\Inventry\V4\Service

Once the files are in the correct folders, go back into the ""Silent Installer"" and right click ""Run as administrator"" on the ""Silent Installer.exe""

This should then present a CMD prompt and confirm the results of the SSL certificate update.

You can also confirm this by opening a new CMD window and entering the below command.

Netsh HTTP show sslcert

Please note you will have to extract the .RAR files.

Kind regards,
Brett.

"","","Ellis Mitchell Y12","Hi Rash,

I have a Y12 student, Ellis Mitchel, who needs to access a file that has
been emailed to him. When he clicks on any email from his school gmail
account, it freezes and doesn't open. The only notification he gets is a
""loading"" pop up. There is no error code and he has tried logging in and
out as well as signing out completely.

Any ideas how to fix?

Thanks

Ben

"","","Changes to PC set up","Good afternoon

Rashid has suggested I put a ticket through as the settings on my PC keep
changing as follows:

The chrome shortcut won't work - Rashid reset this recently and it has
disappeared off my desktop
The clock keeps disappearing and needs to be switched on again.
Other shortcuts e.g. the snip tool on the task bar disappear

It's not a problem when I'm working off site on other computers - just my
PC in the Pathfinder office.

Rashid will be able to tell you more about it.

Rachel Hardy is having the same problems so she will also send a ticket in.

Thanks

As discussed yesterday, it appears that the same issue with regards to
dinner account balances not showing correctly between the Parentmail App

I have started an online chat with Parentmail this morning, advising them
to speak with AMI directly, but all they seem to be doing is raising cases
and advising me that the ""technical team"" are dealing with it. (I have
attached the transcript asking them to contact AMI directly)
Is there anything that we can do to speed things up please?
We have had some irate phone calls from parents saying that their child has
been refused service at breaktime because their balances are not correct on
the tills, compared to their Parentmail App balances.

"","","Problem with Chrome - Jessica Fligg year 8","Good afternoon

I had a student today using a Chromebook - Jessica Fligg - in year 8.

She has reported that every time she signs in and goes on Chrome it brings
up pictures and information about Jimmy Saville on her home page. I tried
it myself and she was correct. She says this has been happening for months
and that she has reported it to a few members of staff.

I tried clearing the browser history 'for all time' but then went back in
and it still opened up a home screen showing lots of information about
Jimmy Saville.

Obviously, we don't want this popping up on a child's Chromebook!

Do you know how to fix this at all? There must be some other cache that
needs clearing?

Thanks

That same Audient interfece dropped out again today. I've switched it for

intermittent problem - but the other device was working with the same user
and then suddenly failed - we changed no settings to make the spare device
work and tried unplugging/plugging in the problem device but it wouldn't
come to life.

I've got a production rehearsal tonight so am off over there now, but if
you're free to pop in on Thursday anytime is good for me

Could I please request that a soft phone be set up for Hannah Flavell.
Hannah works at AHS and took over from Sam Willsden who was assigned a soft

dial needed.

I'm unsure as to whether AHS have any spare licences so if you could please

Hi Wendy

The new phone system at Knavesmire Primary School has now been installed,
and CYC have put a message on your old number to inform callers of your new
number.

 Attached is a spreadsheet “KPS – Phone Extension Handover Information”
with details of individual extension setup and “KPS – NFON Call Routing”
which illustrates the incoming call flow handling.

Below are links to the online manuals for the Yealink Desktop Phone Range,
which you may find useful. Please look for the “Basic Functions” and
“Advanced Functions” links on the menu to the left of the page

 Yeaklink Desktop Phones

1. Introduction (nfon.com)

During my handover, I mentioned a web-based utility called NControl. Users
can use this web utility to customise their extensions settings such as
call forwarding and function keys. To access the utility go to
https://ncontrol.nfon.com/en/login You will be asked to enter an
identifier. For Pathfinder this is KCBWX. Your password is your voicemail
PIN. By default, these are set as your extension number. Below is a link to
the online user guide for NControl

This morning even the guest wifi has dropped. I am back to hot spotting my phone.

Sorry to be a pain!

Also I am speaking to Hannah re a new laptop (hence trying to get on currys website)  so hopefully will be in touch soon to place an order soon.

"","","Moving files","Hi

I am attaching my line manager for my Ebor Specialist role to this email in
case he needs to give permission for this request.

I am currently creating a shared drive for MFL teachers to access with
resources, ideas etc.
I have some relevant resources of this type in 'Curriculum
Specialists/Networks - MFL folder' which I was added to when taking on this
specific role.

I now want to organise all useful resources in one place - a shared drive
called - 'MFL Subject Lead Information and Resources.'
To do this, I need permission to move files and folders from the '
Curriculum Specialists/Networks - MFL folder' to the new shared drive I am
creating.

Is it possible to give me permission to do this, even if it is just for a
month while I am working on the new shared drive?

Also, I want some folders or files to be private. For example, some
resources are specific to schools who pay for subscriptions and it will
probably go against copyright to share these folders with all Ebor Schools.
Therefore, I want to have some folders 'locked' even if I share the whole
drive with ebor schools and then I can add permissions to schools who
subscribe if they request it from me. Is this possible?

Thanks

Can we put an order in for a device for Huw Thomas, incoming head? See his request below. Additionally, please order a laptop for me, needs to be touch screen and able to use off site. 15” minimum.

Both devices on your 3 year rolling licence please.

Thanks

I would be keen to get a surface pro - I had one at Sherborne and loved it. Am also happy to look into a docking station in my office if that helps. It would mean that I wouldn't need a desktop if that helps to bring the price down. I notice that Simon only uses one screen in his office as well - would it be possible to have two screens in there? I don't know how people survive on one screen these days.

Hi Mel

It has been very helpful to have the old headteachers email come to me over
the last few months. Can I ask to inform Vital that we want the forwarding
facility on this email (that gets sent onto my chris.nichols@york.gov.uk)
to end at the end of this academic year Friday 19th July. With a
bounce/return response on it to say that this email is no longer being
used/accessed from Monday 22nd July 2024. This email is the
Head.Danesgate@Danesgate.yorkschools.net



The new email on the school website is the one we will use from Monday 22nd
July 2024: danesgatehead@danesgatecommunity.org.uk I don’t want this
published on the return response as there is SOOO much junk mail that comes
through. Mel: you will continue to check this for me (but would like Lynn
to take this over on her return!)

Thanks

Chris

"","","Re: List of year 6 children for September Year 7","Good morning

Further to my email below, please note we have had a late decline, so one
child's name has been removed from the list of year 7 starters. A new list
is attached, with that child's name 'struck through'.

Please can you let me know once these children have been given Arbor
accounts so that we can run the Parent Pay letters to send out?

I am sending out the data sheets for parents to complete, as part of their
welcome pack this week.  Once we start to receive those back in school, if
Becky could then update their Arbor entries (once confirmed as set up)?

Thanks, Julia

Hello Vanessa

As per our call I can now see you have uploaded the preadmissions and it
has failed.

The issue is with SIMS/ESS it is not detecting the pre-ad correctly.

This file is a patch which needs to be applied to your SIMS database. If
you do not know what to do with it please contact your SIMS support
provider.

Kind regards

Hello

School need to follow the below to upload the preadmissions they do not
sync automatically.

*Pre-admission upload for schools using SIMS MIS*

If you use SIMS as your MIS then you can upload your pre-admission pupils
via MIS:Sync.
To do so:

   1. Log into MIS:Sync
   2. Select the *Preadmission* tab
   3. Select *Auto Update*

You will find your pre-admission students in *Group1 > Preadmissions* when
you search on your ParentPay site.

MIS:Sync will only update pre-admission pupils if they have a *Permanent
UPN number* or *Admission number *and in SIMS they are set to a status of
*Accepted*

*Please note: *Pre-admission pupil accounts will be converted to full pupil
accounts during your first upload of the new academic year and will retain
the same parent login details.

Any issues or questions please let me know.

Kind regards

"","","Maths Chromebooks - Impero","Hi Rachid

As we are now using more chromebooks in maths lessons is there a way to
create a group on Impero to be able to watch what the students are doing
during lessons?

I don't know if that is possible with Chromebooks (like it is with the
desktops), but if so then that would be very useful.

Cheers
Mark

I have recently retuned from maternity leave and I am now unable to print
labels but I could before I left. I can get as far as changing the printer
preferences so they print onto the labels correctly but the options don't
appear.

Thanks Louise

"","","Fwd: Help with a new notification","Hi

I know this was sorted before but Docebo have now changed their
functionality. I'm wondering if this is why any emails from the training
system come up as potential spam?

Would you be able to have a look for me please? Rob has an account set up
on there but I can give others access if needed.

I've tried to do it myself but it gives me codes to cut and paste into a
DNS provider settings, which I presume is on your side?

Thanks

Hi Louise,



Docebo recently rolled out new functionality under the new Domain
Management Page in the LMS.



As a result, an email sender domain for “ebor.academy” will need to be
configured. This can be configured within Domain Management, under settings
in the Admin Menu. Screenshots below:







Further details can be found in the following knowledge base article Domain
Management: Configuring email domains
<https://help.docebo.com/hc/en-us/articles/14656947588114-Domain-Management-Configuring-email-domains>



Until the above has been actioned, no notifications can be configured or
sent from the LMS.

Please could you help me with the following notification? It's giving me an
error but I've check it against the other notifications and they all have
the same email address so not sure, once again, where I'm going wrong.



It's in the discover, coach and share section.
